Ah, {PlayerName}. What can I do for you?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
I have a business proposal for you...

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
How exciting! "Business proposal" is one of my favorite two-word phrases, right up there with "tax free" and "roasted haggis."

Would you consider adding Minnie and Daisy's fashion line to your store?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Pretty please?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think it could be a great addition.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Or are you too afraid to take risks?

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
I appreciate ya askin' nicely, but this isn't how I conduct business.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
I need to see something concrete before I even THINK about adding something to my wares!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Hmm... And how do you figure that? Have you seen any of their wares?

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Not... yet?

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
First rule of business, {PlayerName}: Never invest in something without thoroughly inspecting a sample or prototype.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Afraid to take risks? Me? Never!

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
But I must see something concrete before I make any decisions. Come back with a proof of concept or a sample.
