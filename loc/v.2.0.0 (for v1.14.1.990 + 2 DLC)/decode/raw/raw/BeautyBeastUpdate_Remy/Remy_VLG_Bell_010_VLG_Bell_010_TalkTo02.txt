{PlayerName}! Always good to see you. What can I do for you today?

TAG: Remy_001_f
Belle and I are gathering <ActivityItem>Books</ActivityItem> borrowed from the Library andâ

TAG: Remy_002_f
And you want me to return the one I borrowed.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Trust me, I wish I could. Unfortunately, there's one small problem...

TAG: Remy_004_f
I lost it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll find it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What happened?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But you're usually so careful.

TAG: Remy_006_f
That would be great! If anybody can do it, it's you. Okay, here's what happened...

TAG: Remy_007_f
I was reading the novel â <ActivityItem>Extraordinary RATventures</ActivityItem>, about a rat adventurer â on the pontoon on Dazzle Beach...

TAG: Remy_014_f
But then Donald tripped on a turtle and started yelling.

TAG: Remy_009_f
He startled me so much I dropped the <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> in the water. It's gotta be ruined, right?

TAG: Remy_010_f
Knowing Merlin, he must have enchanted all of the books from the Dreamlight Library to protect them from getting damaged.

TAG: Remy_011_f
You think so? I guess that would be a pretty Merlin thing to do.

TAG: Remy_012_f
I'll <Lore>try to fish it out from Dazzle Beach</Lore> once I get the rest of the books back. Thanks!

TAG: Remy_008_f
I know... I feel just awful about it.
