You're lookin' for an Eel? Are ya sure?

They're slippery as... eels! A-hyuck! Well, you're gonna need worms and a fishing trap.

I always find lots of worms burrowing around the ponds in the Meadow.

You just gotta dig 'em up, then craft a trap with wood, and head to the water to place your trap.

It'll attract plenty of <ActivityItem>Eels</ActivityItem> for whatever it is you're doin'.

Oh! The best place to put the trap is near the dock on the Beach. Good luck!
