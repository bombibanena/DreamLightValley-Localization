Gawrsh, what's this I hear about a little robot fella you're tryin' to bring to the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_f
WALLÂ·E? Yeah, he's...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...very shy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
...super helpful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
...so funny.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Believe it or not, I can be a little bashful sometimes too.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Now, I also hear you're looking for interesting stuff to help bring the little guy out of his shell.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Wish I had something for ya. Sorry. But I'd love to show ya this boot I fished outta the pond the other day. And guess what?

TAG: Goofy_004_f
There's a plant growin' in it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Gimme the boot!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
May I please have it?

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Gawrsh, I'm pretty fond of this boot... I wanna see what the plant grows into.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
But you know how boots are... They come in pairs!

TAG: Goofy_007_f
You should go fish around the ponds in the Meadow. I bet you'll find its match.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
That's great! We can always use more help around the Valley.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Well, we can always use more laughs here in the Valley!
