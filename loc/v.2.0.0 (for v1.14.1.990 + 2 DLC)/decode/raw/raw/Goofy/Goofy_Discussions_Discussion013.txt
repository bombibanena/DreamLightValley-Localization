Howdy, {PlayerName}. I'm doin' a customer satisfaction survey, and you're one of my most loyal customers.

Is there anything you'd like to change about my Stall?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Lower prices.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A more diversified inventory.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No complaints. You're doing great!

Gawrsh, Uncle Scrooge told me my prices were too low already.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Then he said something about "profit margins," and "surplus value." I didn't really follow.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
But I could have some sales. Everybody loves buyin' somethin' and gettin' somethin' else for free.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I sure do appreciate the feedback.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Gawrsh, I try to change up my stock as much as I can...

TAG: Goofy_007_f
...but don't worry. I'll keep looking for more stuff to sell!

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Really? Wow!

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Uncle Scrooge is always tellin' me I gotta be more savvy about business.

But I guess all that really matters is making your customers happy.
