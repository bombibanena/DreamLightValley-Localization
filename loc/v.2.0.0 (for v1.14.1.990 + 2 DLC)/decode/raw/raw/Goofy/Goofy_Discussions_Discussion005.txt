Really?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't believe you.

You bet it is!

If you like, I could tell you about my Uncle M. Angelo Goof or Aunt Goophelia!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
M. Angelo Goof?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Aunt Goophelia?

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Uncle M. Angelo Goof's an artist! He's into post cubical expressionism and la-de-dadaism.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
I don't always understand his paintings, but they sure are interesting to look at!

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Dear old Aunt Goophelia... She brings her kitchen with her whenever she visits.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
Ooh, and you should taste her Torpedo Chicken. It's guaranteed to sink the strongest stomach.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
For really really!

Aw, I'm not kiddin'.
