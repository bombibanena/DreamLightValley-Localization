Gawrsh, {PlayerName}, you've got a sort of curious look on your face. Do you have a question for me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How do you stay so cheerful all the time?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why did you open a Stall?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What's your favorite kind of sandwich?

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Well, I'm not always cheerful, but I sure try to be.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
If I'm feelin' down, I try to think about a real good memory of spending time with my friends. That's sure to put a big smile on my face!

I sorta just stumbled into it! I was walking down the street with some apples and ran into Uncle Scrooge. He asked how much they were, but I said he could just have one!

TAG: Goofy_004_f
He said I shouldn't be givin' away somethin' for nothing. So, I asked him what I should do instead.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Then, before I knew it, I'd opened this Stall!

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Aw, that's easy. Every sandwich! Today, I'm really lookin' forward to the pickle and peanut butter on rye one I made last night.
