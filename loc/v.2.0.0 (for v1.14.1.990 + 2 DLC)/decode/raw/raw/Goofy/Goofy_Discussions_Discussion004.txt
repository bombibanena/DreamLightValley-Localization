TAG: Goofy_002_f
Aw, I'm a great cook! Folks especially love my meatballs and how I serve 'em.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
I whack 'em towards ya with a ping-pong paddle so you can catch 'em in a bowl! Pretty fun, huh?

TAG: Goofy_014_f
... Maybe you can do something else.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
I'm great at construction work! Hammering, and sawing, and pouring cement are my specialties.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Though I oughta tell you: There've been a few accidents on some of the jobs I've worked.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
How many?

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Five hundred and thirty six. What're the odds, right?

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Sure, I'm real good at cleaning. Oh, except for the time the vacuum escaped and got the cat.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
And the time I accidentally set the windows on fire by exploding a broom.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
Oh, I go fishing all the time! And I catch lots of fish, too.

TAG: Goofy_011_f
I've even got a signature cast I can show ya.

TAG: Goofy_012_f
And you won't fall in more than nine times out of ten.

TAG: Goofy_013_f
Are you sure? Well, let me know if you think of something I could help with.
