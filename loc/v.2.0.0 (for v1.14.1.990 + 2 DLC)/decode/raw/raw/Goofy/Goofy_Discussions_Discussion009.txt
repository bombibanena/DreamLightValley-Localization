Ya know pal, my favorite part of runnin' my Stall is gettin' to spend all day talkin' to folks.

Who's your favorite Villager to talk to?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Don't you get tired?

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Gawrsh, I like spendin' time with everybody.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
But... can ya keep a secret?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No.

If I had to pick a favorite, it'd be you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Well, I guess it's not much of a secret. I'll tell ya anyway.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Nah! I could chat with folks all day.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Carrying all the fruit can be tiring, though. Sometimes I gotta rest my arms, but I can keep talkin'!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Is running a Stall complicated?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Let me know if you ever need help!

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Not the way I do it.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Uncle Scrooge makes his shop real complicated, but I try to keep things simple.
