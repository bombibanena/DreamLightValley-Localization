Howdy, {PlayerName}! I sure am happy to see ya. How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_f
Kristoff wants to open a <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sure you have some advice!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What does it take?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It can't be that complicated.

TAG: Goofy_000_f
Gawrsh, Kristoff's gonna have his own <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>, huh? That's great!

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Between you and me, he's a real clumsy fisherman, so I'm glad he doesn't wanna do that professionally.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Hmm... I'm pretty sure I've got just what he needs.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
These are parts from my first <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>, but you'll have to repair it.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
You'll need rock solid <ActivityItem>Stone</ActivityItem> for a good foundation...

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem> for the frame.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
And <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem> so everything can be held together by nails.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Good luck putting it together!
