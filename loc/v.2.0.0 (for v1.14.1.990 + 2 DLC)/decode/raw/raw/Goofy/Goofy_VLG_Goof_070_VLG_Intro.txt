{PlayerName}, you sure took some great photos! Our scrapbook looks real professional!

TAG: Goofy_007_f
But I just realized it's missing an important part! Can you help me?

Sounds fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure, but aren't scrapbooks a little out of fashion?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can't right now. I've got to run!

Okay, here's what I'm thinkin'... We got pictures of plants, and critters, and landmarks, and even a picture of us.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
But we're missing pictures of other folks!

TAG: Goofy_006_f
I wanna add photos of my best pals, Donald and Mickey.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
And you should add pictures of the folks you love!
