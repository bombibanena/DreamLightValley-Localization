Gawrsh, {PlayerName}, I could use your help. Uncle Scrooge says I should do regular inventory of all my stock to make sure nothing's gone missing.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Got any advice on the best way to do that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Count everything you have in stock.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Beats me. Sounds like a lot of work.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
I could try that... but I don't know how much I started out with in the first place.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
So I got nothin' to compare it against.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Sounds like you should count them now and then count them again in a couple of months to check.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Sure, I could do that.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Hmm... should I count stuff by the piece or by the pound?

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Apples would be easy to count by the piece, but seeds could take a while. I'll keep thinkin' on it. Thanks, pal!

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Well, Uncle Scrooge says I've gotta count everything I've got in stock...

TAG: Goofy_009_f
...then count it again in a little while and see if they match up.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
So you've got to count it all... just so you can count it again later?

TAG: Goofy_011_f
Yep. But should I count stuff by the piece or by the pound?
