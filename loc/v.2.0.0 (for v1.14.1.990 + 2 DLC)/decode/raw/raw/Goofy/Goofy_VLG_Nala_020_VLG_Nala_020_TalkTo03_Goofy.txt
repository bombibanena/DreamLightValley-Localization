Say, {PlayerName}, I think there might be something fishy goin' on around here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What makes you think that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is that a pun...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What else is new?

TAG: Goofy_005_f
See, I was fishin' down near Dazzle Beach, and I saw this funny thing in the water.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Right. There's some sort of mystical rift. Nala and I are trying to figure out what's going on.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Yep, I saw that, but that's not all.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
I cast out my line near the rifty thing, and then I saw this funny fish swimmin' out of it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What did the fish look like?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Did you catch it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Funny... how?

TAG: Goofy_010_f
Ya know how lotsa fish are sleek and kinda pretty? This wasn't like that at all.

TAG: Goofy_011_f
It had big bulgin' eyes comin' outta the top of its head. And it was glowing real odd-like and shiny.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
One look at it, and I hightailed it back to the Meadow!

TAG: Goofy_013_f
I didn't wanna lose another fishin' rod tryin' to catch it. I'm on my fifth one this week.

TAG: Goofy_014_f
Uncle Scrooge says he's gonna have to start ordering 'em in bulk!

TAG: Goofy_015_f
Just leave this whole fishy situation to me. I'll try <Lore>catching the weird fish near the rift.</Lore>

TAG: Goofy_012_f
Nuh-uh. It looked like trouble.

TAG: Goofy_000_f
Well, I didn't mean it to be, but now that you mention it, I guess it is!

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Hmm... I s'pose we do have a lot of fishy things going on in the Village. But this one's EXTRA fishy.
