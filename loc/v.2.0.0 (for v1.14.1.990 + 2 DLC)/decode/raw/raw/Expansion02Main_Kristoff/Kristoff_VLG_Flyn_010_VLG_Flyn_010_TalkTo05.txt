I had a good talk with Flynn.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
And did he open up to you?

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Yeah. And you're right. The poor guy's hung up on a girl. But he wants to solve everything to do with Maleficent's curse before he goes looking for her again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh! Poor Flynn!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This is all Maleficent's fault!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That doesn't make sense!

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
I know...

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Heartbreak isn't easy. Trust me; I'm familiar with it.

Even though I chose to wipe Anna from my memory for a good reason, it was hard to get over, even when I remembered her again.

TAG: Kristoff_014_f
You can't feel good when you think you hurt someone you love, even unintentionally.

TAG: Kristoff_015_f
Flynn just needs to know that if he needs help getting to the bottom of what happened with Maleficent... I'll be there for him.

TAG: Kristoff_016_f
You should tell him that. I think he'd really appreciate it.

TAG: Kristoff_017_f
Thanks for your help, Kristoff.

The more I get to know Anna, the harder it is to see her upset that I don't remember her.

TAG: Kristoff_019_f
I don't feel good knowing she's hurting, no matter what happened.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
That curse sure did a number on him. But it's even deeper than that.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
He's lonely. I can understand that.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Feelings are complicated and confusing... not always clean-cut like a block of ice.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
And heartbreak is not an easy thing to get through. I know.
