How curious... It seems the other chambers hold the key to opening the trap door.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
These must be tests! Tests of the precise qualities this ancient civilization valued.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
The Ancient Console in the North Chamber?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
The raised platform in the West Chamber?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
The musical notes in the East Chamber?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
It is some form of ancient technology. The ancient civilization valued technological innovation.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
You'll have to find someone on Eternity Isle who can speak to this contraption. Someone well-versed in such things.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
EVE?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
WALLÂ·E?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Goofy?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Yes, EVE would be perfect! She spent ages on Eternity Isle, surrounded by all this ancient technology.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Got it. I'll ask EVE for help.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
There you have it! The ancient civilization must have prized <Lore>strength and heroism, technological know-how and innovation, and creativity and music</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_033_f
But no one person could have embodied all those talents. So perhaps what they valued most of all was...

TAG: Merlin_034_f
...friendship and collaboration! Which means, no individual can reach the Spark of Imagination on their own.

TAG: Merlin_032_f
But with the help of <Lore>Gaston, EVE, and Rapunzel</Lore>, I'm sure you'll get there.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
WALLÂ·E... Hmm, not a bad suggestion. But someone like EVE might be even more helpful.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
She spent ages on Eternity Isle, surrounded by all this ancient technology.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Goofy?! Oh, no, no, no! Why, even a fishing rod can become a major malfunction in his hands!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Someone like EVE would be much more helpful.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Why, it looks like some sort of podium. I suspect a statue of a pair of great heroes once stood here, but it's long crumbled away.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
You must find someone quite hefty to stand on it and trigger it. Someone who can strike a heroic pose.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Evidently, this ancient civilization prized strength and heroism. We'll require someone like that.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Maui?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Gaston?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Me, of course!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
The idea has merit, but I daresay Maui might be a bit TOO much for this platform. The ancient civilization could not have depended on succeeding generations having a demigod in their midst.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Gaston, though... he would do quite nicely.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Great. I'll talk to Gaston about how to trigger that one.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Brilliant! Gaston should work nicely.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Well, you ARE quite heroic, {PlayerName}, but I'm not sure you'll do the trick this time.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
We need someone with a thicker neck... and perhaps a stomach full of eggs...

TAG: Merlin_020_f
... Gaston?

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Yes! Gaston would do quite nicely.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Hmm... It seems the ancient civilization prized creativity, and specifically music as one of the purest creative forms.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
You'll have to find someone with a bit of musical know-how to unlock that one.

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
Scrooge McDuck?

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
Remy?

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
Rapunzel?

TAG: Merlin_026_f
I've heard Scrooge croon some fine Scottish folk tunes, but in this case, well... er... I'm not sure he's quite the fellow for the task.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
Perhaps you could ask Rapunzel? She's a fine singer and also a lovely guitar player.

TAG: Merlin_030_f
Great. I'll go talk to Rapunzel.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Remy is an excellent cook, but I think we're in need of someone who can sing and play an instrument.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
A most astute suggestion. She's a fine singer and instrumentalist!
