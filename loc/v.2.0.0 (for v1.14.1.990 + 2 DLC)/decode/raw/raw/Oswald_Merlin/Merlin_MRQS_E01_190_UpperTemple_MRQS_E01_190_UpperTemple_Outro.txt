I've done some investigation, {PlayerName}, and I can confirm what I suspected.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Jafar's experiments have begun to <Lore>cause parts of Dreamlight Valley's past to leak through to the present</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
How do we stop him?

TAG: Merlin_023_f
For now, at least, it appears he hasn't a clue how to work the Spark's magic. There must be some trick to it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe he doesn't know the magic word?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe the Spark is busted?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Maybe you need to be pure of heart?

TAG: Merlin_000_f
I suppose it's possible that a magic word is required, but I haven't found anything like that in my research.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Hey, speaking of the Spark and things from the past... do you happen to know a rabbit by the name of Oswald?

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Hmm? Why, er... no, I can't say that I do.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
I discovered him in the Ancient Ruins. But he seems to be having some trouble communicating.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
I think he might have been here in Dreamlight Valley before any of us.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
How peculiar.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Well, perhaps if you befriend this rabbit, you'll uncover more about Dreamlight Valley's past.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
That might be just the key to preserving its future!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Oh dear, I... I hope not. I fear that would mean Dreamlight Valley itself could start coming apart at the seams.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Yes, perhaps one must have a certain quality within to wield the Spark. Though I'm not sure purity of heart is quite the right one...
