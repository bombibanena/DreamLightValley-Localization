This is it, {PlayerName}. Do you see that door?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Through there, you'll find the answers we seek.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's make with the magic!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This spell isn't dangerous, is it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
If only I could swim like a mermaid...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
I... Well, I couldn't have said it better myself.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Focus the magic of your Hourglass on the doorway...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
It worked! And the fabric of reality didn't unravel as I feared it might.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Whoa! That place looks huge!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Guess it's time to delve into some ancient ruins!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Excuse me?! Unravel the fabric of what now?!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
It seems our ancient friends did everything in their power to keep the Spark safe.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Now then, the Spark of Imagination lies deep within the temple. And I'm sure there will be some vexing mysteries inside. These sorts of ancient ruins are always full of such conundrums.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
We must <Lore>press on through the doorway to discover what's inside</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
There's nothing as exciting as uncovering the past. Quite literally, in this case!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Oh, never mind that. The odds of a total collapse of the universe were infinitesimal, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Well, er... meddling with time always has its dangers. But as far as these sorts of things go, the spell ought to be quite safe.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Perhaps someday, {PlayerName}. But for now, we'll just have to rely on magic.
