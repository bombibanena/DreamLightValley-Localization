{PlayerName}, what a surprise. I thought you might still be at Merida's festival...

TAG: Player_000_f
I came to check on you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Do you feel left out of the party?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you like parties?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Merida asked me to.

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
Bless Merida's heart. These papery pages simply don't have the constitution for bagpipes.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
I truly am fine with being on the fringes here. But... I wonder if you might help me with <Lore>a gift for Merida</Lore>.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
She has done much for the Vale. I would like to contribute to the celebration.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Of course I'll help!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Your relationship is so sweet.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Kinda wanted to go back to the party...

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
I knew you would. You have such a generous spirit.

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
Take this <Lore>tapestry</Lore>. I will need a little help from you to finish putting it on display but... it will show Merida how proud I am of her.

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
Merida is as important to me as I am to her.

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
You're in luck. My gift will be perfect FOR the party.

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
I like libraries. Libraries are... the opposite of parties.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
She was here earlier... Perhaps not convinced I am fine on my own â what a dear girl.
