{PlayerName}, did you see what I saw within my pages? Maleficent and Hades share a deep wound.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
Neither felt welcome at an important gathering. Both took the slight... rather personally.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Maleficent wasn't invited to Aurora's honoring celebration.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Hades didn't feel like anyone wanted him at the celebration of Hercules' birth.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I don't get why this matters.

TAG: Lorekeeper_018_f
Precisely. Maleficent cursed Aurora from that day forward.

TAG: Lorekeeper_019_f
Yes, yes. After that ignominious snub, Hades was more determined than ever to overthrow Mount Olympus.

TAG: Lorekeeper_020_f
Because now I remember precisely what led Maleficent and Hades to steal away the Storybook Vale in the first place!

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
During the Forgetting, my old friend Merlin neglected to invite the villainous pair to a great gathering of all the most powerful magic-wielders in the Valley.

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
He meant to, really. He merely forgot.

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
Maleficent and Hades swore revenge for being disrespected once more.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
THAT'S what this is all about? Those two are SUCH babies.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I get it. It feels bad not to be included.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'd probably have done the same thing.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
They are childish, they are petulant, and despite being the Mistress of All Evil and lord of the Underworld...

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
...their feelings are all too human, aren't they? No one likes to be left out. Not even a rather talkative book.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I guess I can sort of understand that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not buying it. Dealing with hurt feelings is part of being grown up.

TAG: Lorekeeper_021_f
We need not excuse their actions, only understand their motivations.

TAG: Lorekeeper_022_f
Perhaps if there was some way to make them both feel important and included...

TAG: Lorekeeper_023_f
Something with <Lore>fancy invitations</Lore> made just for them?

TAG: Lorekeeper_028_f
Yes, yes! Invite them to a great gathering to discuss how we can put a stop to the Neverafter once and for all.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
We need a name for this endeavor. Something to unite us all...

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
The Grand Council of the Neverafter.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
The Guardians of the Vale.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
The Lorekeeper's Legion.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
Hrm... yes... it sounds quite official, doesn't it?

TAG: Lorekeeper_030_f
It's time to convene the <Lore>Grand Council of the Neverafter</Lore>!

TAG: Lorekeeper_029_f
{PlayerName}, <Lore>make the invitations and gather everyone</Lore> right here in the Library of Lore. I will prepare a stirring speech...

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
Oh, my. How heroic! Maleficent and Hades will feel quite flattered indeed.

TAG: Lorekeeper_031_f
It's time to assemble the <Lore>Guardians of the Vale</Lore>!

TAG: Lorekeeper_032_f
Oh... you'd like to name it after me?

TAG: Lorekeeper_033_f
I can't tell you how moved I am, {PlayerName}. Before you arrived, I feared the Vale was doomed to be overrun by ink.

TAG: Lorekeeper_034_f
It's an honor to convene the first meeting of the <Lore>Lorekeeper's Legion</Lore>.

TAG: Lorekeeper_013_f
Yes, despite being the Mistress of All Evil and the lord of the Underworld, their feelings are all too human, aren't they?

TAG: Lorekeeper_014_f
I too can understand the all too human emotions that drove the Mistress of All Evil and the lord of the Underworld...

TAG: Lorekeeper_015_f
...but are you truly implying that if you weren't invited to a party, you would sow chaos across the entire Vale?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Er... I guess not.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Definitely. I take parties VERY seriously. Parties have cake!

TAG: Lorekeeper_016_f
Good. I was worried for a moment there.

TAG: Lorekeeper_025_f
But back to the subject of Maleficent and Hades...

TAG: Lorekeeper_017_f
Hrm. While I cannot eat cake myself, I do enjoy a good description of a cake.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
A chocolate cake with a layer of extra-rich fondant on top...

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
A coconut cake that's not too dry and not too gooey...

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
I'll describe cakes to you later. Right now we gotta focus.

TAG: Lorekeeper_024_f
Hmmm! Delectable!

TAG: Lorekeeper_027_f
Errr, but we mustn't get distracted by cakes. Back to Maleficent and Hades!

TAG: Lorekeeper_026_f
Er, yes, yes. Back to Maleficent and Hades!
