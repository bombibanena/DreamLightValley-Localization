Hello {PlayerName}. What brings you here?

TAG: Lorekeeper_001_f
I'm actually trying to help Flynn out right now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He's howling mad at his situation.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He needs the support of his pack right now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's fur-getting himself.

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
... It's a wolf pun.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
I know.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
So, is it the case that Flynn still thinks he's the Wolf of the Wilds?

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
Not exactly. He says he can't resist his urge to chase things, and the Frog Snippets have been particularly bothersome.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
If Snippets are the problem, thankfully there is a simple solution.

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
The Snippets can be kept at bay by disrupting the Story Magic.

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
Great! What do I need to do?

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
A <ActivityItem>Basic Faerie Snippet Repellent</ActivityItem> will do the trick. Here is the recipe for it.

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
That sounds perfect! Thank you!
