Ahhhh... that feels MUCH better.

TAG: Lorekeeper_001_f
My pages were beginning to get all crumpled...

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
All my magic was seeping away. *cough cough* Agh...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What more can I do to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've never met a book that was ill before.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I fixed you up. Now can you help us?

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
Well, no problem can be fixed until it is understood.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What is the Neverafter?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What caused the feud?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Who are Maleficent and Hades?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
This is a real mess! How can I fix all this?

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
And there's no better way to understand a problem than by listening to a story.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
Sit back, while I regale you with the tale of how this land fell into disrepair.

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
A tale that YOU helped restore to my pages.

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
<Lore>The Storybook Vale...</Lore> this land... is the place in your heart where your favorite stories live.

TAG: Lorekeeper_013_f
A world <Lore>sewn together from fables and myths</Lore>.

TAG: Lorekeeper_014_f
Once upon a time, this land hung in the sky above Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Lorekeeper_021_f
Only you can stop <Lore>the Neverafter<Lore> and set this all right.

TAG: Lorekeeper_022_f
It's what I've taken to calling the phenomena sweeping over the Vale.

TAG: Lorekeeper_023_f
Ink bleeding from the land itself... strange happenings... the pages of my stories becoming scattered...

TAG: Lorekeeper_024_f
We must fix it, before it robs us all of a happily ever after.

TAG: Lorekeeper_043_f
This is a real mess! How can I fix all this?

TAG: Lorekeeper_033_f
Oh, it will be quite simple.

TAG: Lorekeeper_034_f
You must <Lore>bring Hades and Maleficent together and end their squabbling</Lore>!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Simple?! That sounds impossible.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Uh, easier said than done.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I'll lock them in a room together and FORCE them to get along.

TAG: Lorekeeper_035_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, nothing is impossible here. This is the Storybook Vale.

TAG: Lorekeeper_038_f
Before you can bring those two together, you must <Lore>clean up around here</Lore>.

TAG: Lorekeeper_040_f
The way is blocked by all that ink gushing up from the ground. Perhaps <Lore>Merida</Lore> can be of some help with that.

TAG: Lorekeeper_041_f
I ask only one other thing... If you come across more of those <ActivityItem>Snippets</ActivityItem> on your journeys, {PlayerName}, do <Lore>bring them back to me</Lore>, eh?

TAG: Lorekeeper_042_f
I have countless stories that need to be put back together again before I can regain my strength.

TAG: Lorekeeper_036_f
Of course, {PlayerName}. It's always easier to tell a story than it is to live one.

TAG: Lorekeeper_037_f
I wish you the best of luck with that approach. Do watch out for any fireballs they start hurling around, won't you?

TAG: Lorekeeper_025_f
Who can say? Maleficent holds great resentment, and the merest slight can enrage her.

TAG: Lorekeeper_026_f
And Hades... It is no play on mere words to say that he's a bit of a hothead.

TAG: Lorekeeper_027_f
Put the two of them in a room together and the consequences are disastrous!

TAG: Lorekeeper_028_f
You've never heard of them? Why, Maleficent proclaims herself the "Mistress of All Evil." You'd best beware of her.

TAG: Lorekeeper_029_f
And Hades is a mythological miser who rules over the Underworld. He can be a bit tricky, but he's not nearly as clever as he thinks he is.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Uhhh, maybe I should just avoid them.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll watch my back around them.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Pfft. They don't scare me.

TAG: Lorekeeper_030_f
You are wise to be heedful. But to save the Vale, you won't be able to avoid them forever.

TAG: Lorekeeper_031_f
Yes, sooner or later, you must confront them, but take great care.

TAG: Lorekeeper_032_f
Best be sure you know the difference between bravery and foolishness.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
No, I suppose even in Dreamlight Valley, you don't come across that often, do you? Heheheâ *cough cough*

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
Now, I've no idea how long I have before my magic departs me again.

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
Ah, straight to the point. I respect that. Cutting through the muddle with only a few words is a rare talent indeed!

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
I shall not waste your time. Let me tell you why I brought you here.
