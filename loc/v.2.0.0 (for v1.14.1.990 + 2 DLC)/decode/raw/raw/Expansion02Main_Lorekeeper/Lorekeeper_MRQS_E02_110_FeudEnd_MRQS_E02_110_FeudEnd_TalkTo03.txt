Maleficent and Hades have agreed to meet?

TAG: Lorekeeper_001_f
They have. But something a little funny came up when I talked to both of them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They both blamed the other for starting the feud.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are we SURE the Neverafter is connected with them?

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
More finger pointing, of course. We should have expected as much.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
I'm not so sure about that.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
Maleficent and Hades both said that <Lore>the ink started showing up BEFORE their feud began</Lore>.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
Why... they must be mistaken. The Neverafter is surely connected to their feud!

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
If it isn't... then I'm afraid I don't have the faintest clue what's really causing all this trouble.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
No. This MUST be the doing of those vile villains.

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
Oh dear... Speaking of which... the Mistress of All Evil has finally taken it upon herself to come down from her castle!

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
And Hades is sure to be here at any moment.

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
Let the first meeting of the <Lore>Grand Council of the Neverafter</Lore> begin!

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
If fireballs start to fly... do be sure to duck.

TAG: Lorekeeper_013_f
Let the first meeting of the <Lore>Guardians of the Vale</Lore> begin!

TAG: Lorekeeper_014_f
Let the first meeting of the <Lore>Lorekeeper's Legion</Lore> begin!

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
What do you mean? Why, it must be!
