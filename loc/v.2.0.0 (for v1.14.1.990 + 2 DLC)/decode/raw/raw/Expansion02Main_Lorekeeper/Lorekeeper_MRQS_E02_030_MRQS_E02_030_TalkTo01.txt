Ahh, {PlayerName}! Where has your story taken you? What have you uncovered?

TAG: Player_000_f
I journeyed into a dark forest in Everafter. That place is...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...so beautiful and mysterious!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...kinda creepy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...not looking too good. There's ink everywhere!

TAG: Lorekeeper_001_f
Yes, it is, isn't it? It's made up of the stories we loved most as children.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
All of the lessons we learned and fables we cherished are there. Even the ones that scared us.

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
For it's often by facing what frightens us that we grow and learn who we truly are.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
I stumbled upon something else there.

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
It was another of those gateways, like the one that I found in Mythopia!

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
Ahhh... I know exactly what you've discovered.

TAG: Lorekeeper_015_f
Beyond that gateway, you will find a <Lore>Fairy Tale Trial</Lore> waiting to test you.

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
When Maleficent took it upon herself to rewrite Everafter... to place her castle at its farthest reach...

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
...the magic went wrong. It all became corrupted and jumbled up, like the pages of a book.

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
And pieces of Maleficent's castle have been scattered across Everafter, spreading their corruption throughout the land!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What will I find inside?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What should I do next?

TAG: Lorekeeper_013_f
I suspect you'll find old fables and fairy tales gone askew...

TAG: Lorekeeper_017_f
...corrupted by the Mistress of All Evil's malevolence.

TAG: Lorekeeper_018_f
You'll have to set them right and reach the very heart of them to undo what Maleficent has done.

TAG: Lorekeeper_019_f
So what should I do next?

TAG: Lorekeeper_014_f
<Lore>Seek the aid of Merida</Lore>. She might just be able to help you get inside the Trial.

TAG: Lorekeeper_020_f
With each Trial you face, you draw one step closer to reaching Maleficent and rescuing the Vale!

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
It looked like some sort of... some sort of gateway, filled with ink.

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
Children's stories often have at least a hint of something perilous, don't they?

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
I feared that might be the case. Once, it was beautiful, even if parts of it â like the forest â could be a bit scary.
