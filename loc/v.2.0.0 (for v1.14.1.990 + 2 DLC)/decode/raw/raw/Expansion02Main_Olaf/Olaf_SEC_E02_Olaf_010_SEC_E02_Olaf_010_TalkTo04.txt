{PlayerName}! You saw the owls up close?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
I did! How did your research go?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Well, I talked to Merlin and he told me several fascinating facts...

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Owls have feathers that let them fly almost silently.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
And their eyes aren't like human eyes, which are spheres. Owl eyes are cone-shaped...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Ooh! And a group of owls is called a "parliament."

TAG: Olaf_007_f
The Lorekeeper told me a parliament is a group that sits around all day making decisions. So I thought maybe we could make something for owls to gather around!
