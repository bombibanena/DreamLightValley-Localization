Oh, hello, {PlayerName}. Was Merlin any help sorting out this magical muddle?

TAG: Minnie_001_f
The books he lent me had so much interesting information, but nothing that will help us.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Merlin gave me a very powerful spell...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He helped put some things in perspective.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We had a little misunderstanding...

TAG: Minnie_002_f
He did?! What sort of spell?

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Well, it's a spell that binds this whole Village together.

TAG: Player_001_f
It's a kind of magic that runs on...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...kind words.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...caring for one another.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...always being there for each other.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Really? That does sound like a very special kind of magic.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Merlin got me to talk to some of the other Villagers, so we could remind you how important you are around here.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Elsa told me about how you're always there to listen to her whenever she needs a friend.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
And Anna told me that nobody can make her laugh like you do. ... Except maybe Olaf.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
And Moana, she said that what she loves best about you is your strength of heart, and that you never give up, no matter what.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
... Oh my. I don't know what to say, {PlayerName}. That is so sweet.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
And I'm very grateful, but... how does that stop us from disappearing into the Here and There?

TAG: Player_002_f
Because that's the magic, Minnie. We'll never disappear again as long as we...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...never stop caring for each other.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...always make sure everyone feels loved.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...always respect what's special about each other.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Oh. Of course! It's so simple. I'm a little embarrassed that I didn't see it before.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
Well, I guess I can return these books to Merlin. As long as you and I are here, I know everything will be okay.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
Because I'll always make sure everyone knows how loved they are.

TAG: Player_003_f
And I'll always...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
...protect the Valley.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
...help everyone out.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
...solve all the weird problems around here.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
I know you will!

TAG: Minnie_015_f
Oh! I just thought of something else.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
I was so worried about everyone disappearing... I didn't realize how much <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> I asked you to bring me to build that <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem>. Was it too much?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
It was no trouble!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
It wasn't too bad.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
IT WAS SO MUCH CLAY, MINNIE.

TAG: Minnie_017_f
Phew! I'm glad it wasn't too much trouble for you to gather all that.

TAG: Minnie_018_f
To thank you, I found some <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> myself. I want you to have it so you can build whatever you like.

TAG: Minnie_019_f
And Uncle Scrooge says he's so happy that the <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem> is helping keep time in the Village that he wants to give you a little reward too.

TAG: Minnie_020_f
Here you go!

TAG: Minnie_021_f
Oh, I'm so sorry, {PlayerName}. I didn't realize how hard it would be to find.

TAG: Minnie_022_f
Oh! I just thought of one more thing.

TAG: Minnie_023_f
Remember how I asked you for some help building that <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Minnie_024_f
I gathered up some <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> to get you started!

TAG: Minnie_025_f
Hopefully now it won't be too hard to gather the rest.

TAG: Minnie_026_f
And Uncle Scrooge is so excited about the project that he lent us some funding.

TAG: Minnie_027_f
There's a project that I've been wanting to do for quite a while.

TAG: Minnie_028_f
I gathered up some <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> to get us started!

TAG: Minnie_029_f
Just hold onto it, and let me know when you're ready to start!

TAG: Minnie_030_f
Oh, good. Merlin's so helpful that way. What did he tell you?

TAG: Minnie_031_f
He told me that there's a magic more powerful than any simple spell holding this Village together.

TAG: Minnie_032_f
You did? About what?

TAG: Minnie_033_f
Well, I thought Merlin was getting me to gather stuff for some kind of spell. But it was something bigger than that. A different kind of magic.
