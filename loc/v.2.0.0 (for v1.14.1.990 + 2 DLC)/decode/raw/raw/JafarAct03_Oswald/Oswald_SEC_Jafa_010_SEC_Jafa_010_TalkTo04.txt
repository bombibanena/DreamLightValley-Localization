Hey, Oswald! I'm checking in with everyone that Jafar dealt with. How has he been around you since the trial?

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Well, that's surprisingly reassuring.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
How do, {PlayerName}! And, actually, Jafar's been swell!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Well, that's good to hear, I suppose. What kind of nice actions has he been doing?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
Well, he brought me a gift â a set of tools for Trolley repair and maintenance!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oh, that's actually very considerate of him.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Yeah! He apologized for before and said that he liked my style.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
And that the <Lore>traditional</Lore> look was always in fashion.

TAG: Oswald_000_f
You know, after hearing what everyone has told me... I think that maybe we should do something for Jafar.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
That idea's tops!

TAG: Oswald_014_f
It's clear that Jafar is trying to ingratiate himself to everyone now.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
We should do something to show that we appreciate his effort.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Hmm...

TAG: Oswald_017_f
Let's see... He did kinda show his own interests with his gift choices â we should use that to start!

TAG: Oswald_018_f
I've got it! We'll decorate around the Palace with furniture that's <Lore>Red</Lore>, <Lore>Black</Lore>, <Lore>Elegant</Lore>, <Lore>Bold</Lore>, and <Lore>Traditional</Lore>!

TAG: Oswald_019_f
Maybe I should talk to Merlin to get a little something extra special too...

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Thanks Oswald; I think you've made things way more clear for me.
