Oswald, are you all right?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
I... I think so.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Gee thanks, {PlayerName}! I'd have been a goner without ya!

TAG: Oswald_003_f
I'm just glad that you're okay.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
But now we need to do something about Jafar. Time to look into another lamp, I think.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Hold up, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Oswald_006_f
When I was under that gizmo of Jafar's, it was connectin' me to him, and I think...

TAG: Oswald_007_f
...I think I got a glimpse into how he ticks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm so sorry â that can't have been a good experience.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you need a sauna to sweat it out?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh? What did you see?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
It sure wasn't, but maybe not for the reason ya think.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
{PlayerName}... Jafar's heart is lousy with loneliness.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Back in the lamp might not be the savvy choice here.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Who knows how evil he might get if he's even MORE lonely!

TAG: Oswald_014_f
What are you saying, Oswald?

TAG: Oswald_015_f
I, uh... I think we should give him another chance.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oswald, are you okay?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You can't be serious.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's... very gallant of you.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
You betcha. Thanks to you!

TAG: Oswald_019_f
I don't know... Jafar has shown us multiple times that he only cares about himself.

TAG: Oswald_020_f
How can we trust that he won't try to take over Eternity Isle again?

TAG: Oswald_021_f
Gee... I, uh... I guess we can't.

TAG: Oswald_022_f
But he ain't the only villain here. And you keep a close eye on them, and they don't dare act up!

TAG: Oswald_023_f
Maybe just livin' around so much Dreamlight Magic makes 'em better.

TAG: Oswald_024_f
That's... very wise of you, Oswald. I'll talk to Jafar.

TAG: Oswald_017_f
I try to avoid it, but this time I can't.

TAG: Oswald_018_f
Thanks, chum.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Nah. I'm okay.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Buckets and buckets of loneliness...
