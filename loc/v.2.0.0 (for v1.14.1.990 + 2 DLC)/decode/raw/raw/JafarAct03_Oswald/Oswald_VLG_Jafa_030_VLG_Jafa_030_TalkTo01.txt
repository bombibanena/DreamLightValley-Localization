What's the news, Oswald?

TAG: Oswald_002_f
How do, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Oswald_003_f
<i>*sigh*</i>

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Gee, not a lot of energy there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oswald, are you feeling all right?

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Sorry, I ain't exactly feelin' copacetic today.

TAG: Oswald_000_f
That'd be swell! And I know a great recipe â lemme jot it down for ya!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
To be honest, I feel kinda strange.

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Oh? What's going on?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
I'm just kinda... empty. Like my bucket of Oswald-ness is rusty and dry.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Are there Dreamlight flus that do that?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Hmm, not that I know of.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
But we can't have you feeling like that! Why don't I fix you something that will stick to your ribs and get rid of that nasty hollow feeling?

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Aww, you're the bee's knees, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Oswald_013_f
I'll bring you some <ActivityItem>Poutine</ActivityItem> â that's a meal that will fill you up like no other!

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Nah, I been feelin' kinda off...
