Hey Oswald, you hanging in there?

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Great! I need you to speak with the other Villagers and try to find someone who can be an impartial judge.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Oof, that might be tough, {PlayerName}. But I'll do my best! I'd be the judge, but things are always black and white with me. Oh-hoo-hoo! Ya get it?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Aw, I'm feeling peachy! Thanks to you o' course, chum!

TAG: Oswald_002_f
That's good to hear!

TAG: Oswald_003_f
I'm interviewing Villagers about their experiences with Jafar and getting a trial together.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
How do you feel about the situation, now that you've had a chance to let things settle?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
A trial, huh? That'd be swell!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
I still mean what I said about givin' Jafar a chance, but the ol' grapevine says that he's been pretty rotten since then.

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Yeah, enough is enough. Would you want to give me a hand with the trial prep?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Absopositively!
