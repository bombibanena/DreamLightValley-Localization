{PlayerName}, how are you, my dear?

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
Quite well, thank you! I'm trying to help Mike Wazowski with something.

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
Well, that's very kind of you. What is Michael in need of?

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
He's looking for people that might be interested in learning comedy. How does that sound to you?

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
Oh my. Learning comedy? I'm not sure I'm really the comedic sort.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
You never know. Sometimes you get surprised by a hidden talent!

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
I don't know...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What if I tell you a joke, and then you try to imagine yourself in my place?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
No problem. You don't have to participate if you don't want to!

TAG: FairyGodMother_026_f
All right.

TAG: Player_000_f
Okay, I'll tell you...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...a knock-knock joke.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...a wordplay joke.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...a "chicken crossing the road" joke.

TAG: FairyGodMother_023_f
My magic is more about helping people achieve their dreams than making them laugh.

TAG: FairyGodMother_024_f
That's really sweet.

TAG: FairyGodMother_025_f
I'll head back to my task then, and let you keep on helping people with their hopes and dreams!

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
Knock knock!

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
Oh... what are you knocking on?

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
It's the setup for the joke â I'm knocking on the door that you're behind, and you need to answer.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Oh, how fun! May my door answer? Sometimes I like to enchant it to speak.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Uhhh, I guess? Your door needs to respond with "who's there?" for this kind of joke.

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
Fortunately, my enchanted doors can see, so they'll know that it's you that's knocking!

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
Okay, this isn't working the way I thought it would.

TAG: FairyGodMother_022_f
I understand, {PlayerName}. I suppose comedy isn't exactly my forte.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
Why was six afraid of seven?

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
Oh dear, I hope seven wasn't being mean to six!

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
No, it's because seven eight nine!

TAG: FairyGodMother_028_f
Get it... seven ate nine?

TAG: FairyGodMother_017_f
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

TAG: FairyGodMother_018_f
A chicken crossing the road? If it's a busy road, that could be dangerous!

TAG: FairyGodMother_019_f
Well, it's something of a figurative road...

TAG: FairyGodMother_020_f
May I be in the joke to help the chicken cross safely?

TAG: FairyGodMother_021_f
Perhaps I could enchant a gourd into a carriage for the chicken!

TAG: FairyGodMother_027_f
That might be best, dear. I don't really consider myself a performer.
