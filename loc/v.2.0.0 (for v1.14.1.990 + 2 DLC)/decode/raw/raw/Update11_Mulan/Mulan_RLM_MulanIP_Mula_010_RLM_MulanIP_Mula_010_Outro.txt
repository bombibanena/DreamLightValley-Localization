These challenges weren't just to train you, though. They also help determine where you'll be most useful.

What was your favorite exercise?

I liked them all.

I do have a favorite.

I enjoy intellectual challenges more than physical ones.

So, you like variety and handle it well. Good to know.

Now, the only thing left for you to do is make Mushu's <ActivityItem>Dragon Statues</ActivityItem>. He should be ready for you.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
Congratulations again, {PlayerName}! You did really well!

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Now, you still have to <Lore>help Mushu with his defense plan</Lore>. You should go talk to him.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
Really? Which one?

Fishing.

The brick-breaking one.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Orienteering.

Patience and precision. Those are the traits of a good archer.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
You like to rely on your strength. That might mean you're particularly suited to front-line defense. Good to know.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Hmm... You'd probably make a great scout. I'll keep that in mind.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
That's okay. We always need good strategists.
