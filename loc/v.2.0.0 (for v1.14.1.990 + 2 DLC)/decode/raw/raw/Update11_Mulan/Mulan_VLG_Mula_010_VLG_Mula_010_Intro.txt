Hey, {PlayerName}. I'm really enjoying myself here, but I could use a little help finding my bearings. Do you have a moment?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course. What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry, not right now.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
Well, one of the most valuable things I learned during my training was the importance of balance.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
You have to use the same discipline when caring for yourself as you do when facing physical challenges.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
If you don't, you won't achieve anything.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Like when we were back in camp â you put the same dedication into your uniform and the camp as you did in the exercises. And all of that helped you excel.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
I'd like to create a similar daily regime for myself here. And I was hoping you'd join me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a great idea.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I guess a little order couldn't hurt...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Routine isn't my thing, but I'll help.

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Oh, I'm so glad to have you by my side! We can even start right now.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
I was thinking we should begin with a good meal.

TAG: Mulan_000_f
Specifically, I'm craving this new food Mickey introduced me to recently... <ActivityItem>Vegetarian Pizza</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Mulan_014_f
Pizza? Well, that's unexpected... but I can make it happen. I'll make sure the Ingredients are fresh, too.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
Great! While you do that, I'm gonna make a new training plan. I know this will help me a lot!

TAG: Mulan_013_f
I bet you'll find it will actually HELP once we get started.

TAG: Mulan_015_f
Thank you. I appreciate you giving it a try.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
That's okay. Whenever you can would be great.
