{PlayerName}, this is amazing! Thank you for all your help!

TAG: Mulan_002_f
Now I just need to put everything together...

TAG: Mulan_003_f
There... The <ActivityItem>Shadow Theater</ActivityItem> is ready. And I think you should choose where it goes in the Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's a great honor.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Any advice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are we sure the puppets are not cursed?

TAG: Mulan_004_f
One you certainly deserve.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
I do have one suggestion... Wait until nightfall to place the theater. The light will be most beautiful in the dark.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
I've never heard of such a thing, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
So, yeah... I'm quite sure there's no curse on my Shadow Theater.
