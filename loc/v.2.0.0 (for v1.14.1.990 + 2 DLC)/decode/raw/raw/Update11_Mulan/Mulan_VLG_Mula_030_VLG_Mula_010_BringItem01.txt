Look at all these beautiful flowers. I found some lovely yellow, purple, and green ones.

TAG: Mulan_002_f
If we put all our blooms together...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...we could make a bouquet?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...we could make a wreath.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...we could make flower crowns!

TAG: Mulan_004_f
That's a good idea, but...

TAG: Mulan_006_f
...I was thinking we could weave them into a mat and use it for camouflage. It would look JUST like a bed of garden flowers.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
Then we'll use it to hide from enemies or for surveillance.

TAG: Mulan_014_f
OR we could use the flowers to map out the plant life in the Village. What do you think?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That sounds... intense.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We don't have enemies in the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Mulan, you sound a little paranoid.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
"Intense"? Not... "fun"? Aiyah...

TAG: Mulan_011_f
This is what Mushu was talking about... I need hobbies outside of training. It's just... That's been my focus so much lately, it's like I've forgotten everything else.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
Okay. I can do this! Let's try another activity. You pick something, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Mulan_013_f
What about some gardening? You said it wasn't your thing, but... maybe I can teach you?

TAG: Mulan_015_f
That's perfect! It's educational AND productive. I mean... fun!

TAG: Mulan_016_f
I've already got some GREAT ideas for a vegetable garden.

TAG: Mulan_017_f
I'll follow your lead.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Oh, right. I know that. UGH!

TAG: Mulan_010_f
I do...? Oh, I guess I do. Sorry. That's the first stuff that popped into my head.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
For decoration? Okay. But...

TAG: Mulan_005_f
A crown of flowers? I never would've thought of that.
