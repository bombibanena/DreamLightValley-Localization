I'm almost ready to go.

I was just wondering... Will there be a place for us to stay in your Valley?

Camping's fine while training, but if we'll be there awhile, it would be great to have a <ActivityItem>House</ActivityItem>. And I'm sure Mushu would like that too. He doesn't exactly like "roughing it."

Sure, I can do that!
