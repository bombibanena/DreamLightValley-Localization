Oh, I was just thinking about backup plans. You know... another cup if the first one breaks...

TAG: Mulan_001_f
...another strategy if your opponent anticipates the first one.

You'll be ready for anything!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Isn't that tiring?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Backup plans for something specific?

TAG: Mulan_002_f
That's the goal! Though it's also important to stay flexible...

TAG: Mulan_003_f
...so you can respond to new things in the moment.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Not really. I suppose it's something I've always done, at least a little.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
And it's just how I think now.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Well, I'd like to get a present for Goofy.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
And a backup present if he accidentally breaks the first one.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Or I suppose I could just make the first present something super durable.
