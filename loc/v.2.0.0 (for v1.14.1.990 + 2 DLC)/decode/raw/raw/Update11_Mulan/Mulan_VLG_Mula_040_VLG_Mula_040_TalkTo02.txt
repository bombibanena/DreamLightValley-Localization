{PlayerName}! We're ready to start!

TAG: Mulan_002_f
We have to find four <ActivityItem>Mini Flags</ActivityItem> using clues the Fairy Godmother has given us.

TAG: Mulan_000_f
She said to <Lore>use all the tools at our disposal to find the flags</Lore>. We should search everywhere, even in the <Lore>water or under the ground.</Lore>

TAG: Mulan_003_f
So, I've decided to apply a divide and conquer strategy. And you're my trusted second in command.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Please help the rest of the team, <Lore>Nala, Maui, and Buzz Lightyear</Lore>, with their clues.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
Once you've got all three, come back to see me, and we'll regroup.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's goooooooo!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds simple enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The pressure... So intense.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Good luck!

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Yes. I think the hardest part will be figuring out the clues. But I trust our team. Ready? Let's go!
