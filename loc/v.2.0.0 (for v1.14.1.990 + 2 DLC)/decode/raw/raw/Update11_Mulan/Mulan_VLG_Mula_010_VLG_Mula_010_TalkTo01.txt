Phew! A good meal, a good workout... This daily regime is really coming together.

TAG: Mulan_000_f
Ooh, you know what would be perfect right now?!

TAG: Mulan_003_f
A warm cup of tea... Do you have tea here? <ActivityItem>Oolong</ActivityItem>? <ActivityItem>Jasmine</ActivityItem>? <ActivityItem>Chrysanthemum</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Mulan_007_f
Hmm... I don't think so...

TAG: Mulan_006_f
That's okay. I know we have a couple of crates of tea back in the camp. I can head back and grab them for us!

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Wait, Mulan! You can't go back to your Realm without losing your memories again. I'm the only one here with the magic to cross back into the Realms safely.

TAG: Player_000_f
I'll go back to the camp.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I love tea!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Tea is good for you, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Even if I'm more of a coffee person.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Well, you'll love the ones we have.

TAG: Mulan_014_f
I bet I will!

TAG: Mulan_001_f
I'll head back to your Realm and search for the <ActivityItem>Tea Crates</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mulan_015_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I really appreciate it!

TAG: Mulan_009_f
That's what my father's doctor says. My bÃ ba is supposed to drink three cups every morning and three every night.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
"Coffee"... I don't think I've ever heard of that.

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Ask Stitch; he'll tell you all about it. In the meantime...

TAG: Mulan_005_f
It's kind of similar to tea. But it's stronger and made from beans instead of leaves.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
Beans...? Well, I suppose that COULD be tasty...

TAG: Mulan_013_f
For now, let's focus on getting that tea. Our daily regime won't be complete without it!
