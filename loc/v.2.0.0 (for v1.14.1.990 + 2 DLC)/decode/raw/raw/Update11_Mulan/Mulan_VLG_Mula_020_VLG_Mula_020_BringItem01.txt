Minnie said she'll bring you the puppets when she's finished them, too.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
Do you need anything else?

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Actually, yes! When I talked to Mushu about the story, he said he wanted to be in charge of lighting for the theater.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
You know, since he breathes fire...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Mushu is a PERFECT lighting director.

I take it it's not that simple...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh no... what's on fire?

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Well, I guess he ran into some trouble.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
Could you go <Lore>talk to him</Lore> and see if you can help?

TAG: Mulan_010_f
I don't know the details. Something about a lantern and fire...

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Nothing! ... Not yet, anyway.

TAG: Mulan_013_f
He just told me he ran into some trouble.
