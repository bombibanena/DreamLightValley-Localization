Oh! You mean my friends from the army?

TAG: Mulan_001_f
Who would you like to hear about? Yao, Chien-Po, or Ling?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Tell me about Yao.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What about Chien-Po?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let's talk Ling.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Is someone SPECIAL missing?

TAG: Mulan_002_f
Well, Yao has a pretty short temper, and he's incredibly tough.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
But I know under all of that he's got a big heart.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Chien-Po is the gentlest person I've ever met.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
I was worried about him going into battle, but his strength helps him look after everyone.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
What can I say about Ling? He's funny, and sometimes he likes to cause trouble.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
Ling's always willing to put his ego aside for the bigger picture. Selfless... but kind of loud about it.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
That sounds like you have someone in mind.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Li Shang!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you blushing?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Mushu!

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Shang?

TAG: Mulan_010_f
*Captain* Shang... is...

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Um... Well, he's certainly my friend. Let's talk about something else!

TAG: Mulan_012_f
No...

TAG: Mulan_013_f
Maybe... There is someone else, but...

TAG: Mulan_014_f
It's complicated.

TAG: Mulan_015_f
Oh, you don't need me to tell you about Mushu.

TAG: Mulan_016_f
Just ask him. He'll tell you EVERYTHING about himself.
