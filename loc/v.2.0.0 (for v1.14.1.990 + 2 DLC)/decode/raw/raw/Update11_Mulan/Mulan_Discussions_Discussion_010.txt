My memories of the Village before the Forgetting are still a little vague...

TAG: Mulan_001_f
But I do remember some things.

TAG: Mulan_002_f
I remember setting up patrols to note where new Night Thorns were popping up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Who was in the patrols?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you stop the Night Thorns?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Will you bring the patrol back?

TAG: Mulan_003_f
Mushu and me. Nala, Maui, Buzz...

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Of course, everyone was trying to help in their own way.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
But eventually there were just too many Night Thorns to report...

TAG: Mulan_006_f
I'm really glad you came back, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
We definitely tried.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Back then, we didn't know you need Dreamlight Magic to weed out Night Thorns.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
But we were determined never to stop fighting for the Valley or each other.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
I would, but... things here have calmed down a lot, thanks to you.
