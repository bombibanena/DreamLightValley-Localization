What are these?

TAG: Mulan_003_f
Where did you find them, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Here and there, during my training. Do you know what they are?

TAG: Mulan_005_f
I do. That's one of the <ActivityItem>Fans</ActivityItem> I had when I helped save the Emperor.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
And that's one of the <ActivityItem>Circular Weights</ActivityItem> I trained with. It helped me show Captain Shang I was serious about being a soldier... And Mushu used the <ActivityItem>Bamboo Snorkel</ActivityItem> when he tried to... help me with fishing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So many memories!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you want to keep them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did Mushu help you cheat at fishing?

TAG: Mulan_007_f
You're right. And good memories too.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
I'd be honored if you'd display them in your House.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
Here, {PlayerName}. It'll be a fun reminder that you and I share the same kind of training.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
No, I think I'd rather have you keep them safe for me.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
I was falling behind. Not our best moment... Eventually I learned how to work on my own.

TAG: Mulan_011_f
These are important pieces of my story... Would you keep them safe?
