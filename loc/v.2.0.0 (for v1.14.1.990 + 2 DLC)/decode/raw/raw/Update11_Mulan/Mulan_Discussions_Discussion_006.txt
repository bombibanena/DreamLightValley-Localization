I once heard a legend about warriors who could dodge raindrops.

TAG: Mulan_001_f
They were so quick and graceful they could walk through the rain and stay dry.

That doesn't sound realistic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That. Sounds. Awesome.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can you train me to do that?

TAG: Mulan_002_f
I don't know. Most legends have at least some truth to them.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
But I've found in training that simple goals are best. Be a bit quicker tomorrow than you were yesterday.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
It does, doesn't it!

TAG: Mulan_005_f
I train to be quick, but that's pretty incredible.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
No. I wouldn't even know where to start.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
But I can train you to be quicker than you were yesterday.
