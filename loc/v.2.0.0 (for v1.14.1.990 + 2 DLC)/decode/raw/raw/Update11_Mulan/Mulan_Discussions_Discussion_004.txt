Well, there are a lot of different qualities that make a good warrior.

TAG: Mulan_001_f
Discipline and strength, certainly.

I'm very disciplined.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm strong.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm neither of those things.

TAG: Mulan_002_f
That's good. Discipline is the foundation of all skill.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
You can learn to do almost anything with practice and determination.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
That's great! But remember, strength doesn't just mean physical strength.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
Being strong of character is just as important.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Oh, I bet you are, in your own way. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here doing what you do. Now tell me... what do you think is your best quality?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm creative.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm kind.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm not sure.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
Me too!

TAG: Mulan_010_f
Actually, now that I think about it...

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Being creative during my first training was what helped me to be disciplined and strong.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
That's wonderful.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
In fact, that might actually be the most important quality for a warrior to have.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Perhaps we can find out together.
