The garden looks so good, {PlayerName}!

After we harvest it, I was thinking we could figure out how to preserve the vegetables in case we need them for rations.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
We could also grow BIGGER crops â pumpkins maybe? And use them for archery practice!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Would that be fun?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Rations sound serious... not fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think we've lost focus here.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
Well... *sigh* I guess not tons of fun.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
There's got to be SOMETHING I can't turn into training! {PlayerName}, I need to think about this.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Could you go <Lore>talk to Mushu</Lore>? He's the one who said I needed more fun in my life. Maybe he has some ideas?

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Huh... You're right. Aiyah!

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Have we? ... Maybe you're right.
