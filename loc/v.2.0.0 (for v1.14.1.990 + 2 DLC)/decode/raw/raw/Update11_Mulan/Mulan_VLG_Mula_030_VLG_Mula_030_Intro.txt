{PlayerName}, can we talk? I have a question about... Well, I guess it's about fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is there a problem? A FUN problem?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't have time for fun!

TAG: Mulan_004_f
It IS a problem with fun. But I'm not sure it's a fun problem.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
Does that make sense? Let me start again.

TAG: Mulan_001_f
What do you like to do for fun here?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I like to dress up and decorate!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I tend to my garden.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm a wild card; I like LOTS of things.

TAG: Mulan_013_f
Oh. Hmm... I've never really thought of those as fun.

TAG: Mulan_015_f
What's up, Mulan?

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Mushu said I should find some hobbies. He thinks that, ever since we opened the training center back home, I work too much. I suppose he has a point. I DO want to try some new things.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll help; I'm a fun expert!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Did you have anything in mind?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm no fun.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Great! Everyone knows you're the most fun person in the Village.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
I was thinking something sort of... relaxing?

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Maybe picking flowers? I know some Villagers like that.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
All right, Mulan. Let's pick some flowers!

TAG: Mulan_010_f
Of course you are. The whole Village loves spending time with you. Let's figure it out together.

TAG: Mulan_002_f
Gardening could be fun, I guess...

TAG: Mulan_014_f
Could you be specific? I don'tâ Aiyah! Why is this so hard?

TAG: Mulan_003_f
I hope that's not true. But we can talk later, all right?
