Looks like you're ready to begin training. How are you feeling about it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Eager to start.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Very anxious about the whole thing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Bring it on! This will be easy.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
That's the spirit!

TAG: Mulan_010_f
Now, I want you to <Lore>complete three exercises: fishing, brick-breaking, and orienteering</Lore>.

TAG: Mulan_001_f
How will those train me into a defender?

TAG: Mulan_013_f
Well, by catching a lot of fish, you'll learn the virtues of patience and precision.

TAG: Mulan_002_f
Plus, it'll give us food.

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Brick-breaking builds strength, and orienteering will challenge your endurance.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
I also want to see how you strategize. So <Lore>you can complete these challenges in any order</Lore>. Report back to me when you're finished.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Oh, don't worry. Just do your best. I don't expect you to move mountains on the first try.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
I wouldn't get too overconfident, if I were you.
