I am! You wear so many interesting things.

TAG: Mulan_001_f
Are they good luck charms?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No â I just like accessorizing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yes, they are!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe. What makes a good luck charm?

TAG: Mulan_002_f
Oh, of course.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
Well, you look wonderful. And who knows... if your accessories make you feel good, that might just be lucky!

TAG: Mulan_004_f
I thought so! I don't know the symbolism of all the things you wear...

TAG: Mulan_005_f
...but the idea is familiar. My grandmother does the same thing.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
She has beads and pendants that all mean different things.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
I'm not sure. My grandmother told me they attract good things to you.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
She knows more about it than I do.
