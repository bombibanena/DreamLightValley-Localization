I think you're ready. Let's do this!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You didn't seem to be paying much attention while I showed you how...

TAG: Stitch_001_f
Goobaja!

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Just be careful, okay...?

TAG: Stitch_005_f
Takah!

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Look! Stitch make it better than before! Yeah?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Looks great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not bad for your first try.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It looks a little funny...

TAG: Stitch_007_f
Thank you.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Let's go <Lore>place these signs around the Peaceful Meadow.</Lore>

TAG: Stitch_012_f
That should show Donald that you can respect his space in the Village.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Should Stitch mess up more signs to practice fixing?

TAG: Stitch_013_f
That's okay. I'm sure there will be other ways to practice.

TAG: Stitch_009_f
Sorry...

TAG: Stitch_010_f
That's okay, Stitch. It's the thought that counts.

TAG: Stitch_002_f
No. Stitch did watch. Expert sign repairer now.

TAG: Stitch_003_f
*sigh* Okay. Let's give this a try.
