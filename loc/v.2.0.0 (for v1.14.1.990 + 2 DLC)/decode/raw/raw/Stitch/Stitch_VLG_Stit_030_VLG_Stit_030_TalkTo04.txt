Ursula is mean, scary monster! Yeah!

Stitch wants to see more sea monsters. Maybe friendly one?

TAG: Stitch_003_f
A friendly sea monster? Well, Ariel's not a monster, but she is from the sea. She's a mermaid.

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Ooh! Mermaid!

TAG: Stitch_007_f
But Ariel can change her shape, so she only looks like a mermaid some of the time.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Change shape?! Like Stitch when he's doggy. Oojika! Stitch wants to see, have adventure!

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Okay. Let's go <Lore>talk to Ariel</Lore>.
