Stitch, I just talked to WALLÂ·E, and it sounds like you've been causing some trouble again.

TAG: Stitch_001_f
Trouble? No. Goodness level very high!

TAG: Stitch_002_f
But Stitch not feel good. Tummy hurts.

TAG: Stitch_003_f
And *yawn*... so sleepy.

TAG: Stitch_004_f
You're sleepy? Why don't you take a nap?

TAG: Stitch_005_f
Nap?! No! Don't want to miss fun things.

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Stitch wants coffee!

TAG: Stitch_007_f
So take dirt from garden and make coffee.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ew! Stitch! No!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No wonder you feel sick!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did it taste any good...?

TAG: Stitch_008_f
You don't make coffee out of dirt. You need coffee beans.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Yeah! Yeah! Beans! I remember!

TAG: Stitch_012_f
Before Forgetting, beans grow on tree.

TAG: Stitch_013_f
But now, no trees and no beans.

TAG: Stitch_014_f
Before Forgetting, I put tree in spaceship for coffee to keep awake.

TAG: Stitch_015_f
Hm. I think this sapling might still be alive. But it's in rough shape. I guess all the Night Thorns strangled its roots.

TAG: Stitch_016_f
If we can just nurture it a little, I'll bet I could whip up some coffee for you in no time.

TAG: Stitch_017_f
I'll go <Lore>talk to WALLÂ·E</Lore> about restoring this sapling to full health.

TAG: Stitch_009_f
No! Iky! Very bad!

TAG: Stitch_010_f
I'm not surprised.
