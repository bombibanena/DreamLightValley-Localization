Hey Oswald, I found this hat. Is it the one you were talking about?

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Gee whillikers, it sure is! Aw, that sure brings me back...

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Here, put it on. You're gonna look real spiffy.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Okey-dokey, now we can get to the important part: buildin' the trolley and its home!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Its... home?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
First, we'll need some <ActivityItem>Trolley Tracks</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
You can make those with <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Plastic Scraps</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
For the trolley itself, ya gotta have <ActivityItem>Ancient Belts</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Plastic Scraps</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Zinc</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Bones</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
And you'll hafta pick a good spot for the trolley's home and decorate it with the <ActivityItem>Trolley Tracks</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
When that's done, come find me, 'cause we'll be almost ready to welcome the trolley to Eternity Isle!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds like a plan!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I feel like a combination of a city planner and a mad scientist...

TAG: Oswald_013_f
See you soon!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Yeah, the trolley's gotta have someplace to live!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oh, of course. Silly me!
