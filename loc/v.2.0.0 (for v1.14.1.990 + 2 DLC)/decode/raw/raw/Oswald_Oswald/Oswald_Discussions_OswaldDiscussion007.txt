Your silent rabbit friend glances at you... Could that be a challenge in his mischievous eyes?!

TAG: Oswald_001_f
He gestures solemnly with one hand, while the other forms a fist, then stretches the hand out flat, and finally sticks two fingers out. What could he be trying to say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Uhhh, what now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you making hand shadows?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You want to play rock-paper-scissors?

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Oswald repeats the gesture. But this time with both hands, each hand making a different shape.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Oooohhh, you want to play rock-paper-scissors!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
The plucky rabbit nods his head with a grin and then bounces one fist over his other open hand. The challenge has begun!

TAG: Player_001_f
Okay, I'll pick...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Rock!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Paper!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Scissors!

TAG: Oswald_005_f
With a slump of his shoulders, the rabbit shows that he has picked Scissors.

TAG: Oswald_006_f
He frowns and stamps on the ground â he must be getting frustrated!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Sorry Oswald, I win this round!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Play again?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I think that's enough for me today.

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oswald nods furiously. He's not out yet!

TAG: Oswald_009_f
He begins to smirk as he readies his hand.

TAG: Player_003_f
Okay, here goes round two!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Rock!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Paper!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Scissors!

TAG: Oswald_010_f
When his hand opens up, it has somehow twisted into... a cartoon stick of dynamite?!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Hey, no fair â we didn't discuss adding dynamite!

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Oswald gives a big grin and shrugs â that scamp!

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Fine, you get this round...

TAG: Oswald_014_f
When his hand opens up, it has somehow twisted into... a cartoon stick of dynamite?!

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Good thing I picked scissors â I snip the dynamite fuse!

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Oswald clutches his face in mock shock! But he quickly extends a hand to shake yours in congratulations for winning.

TAG: Oswald_017_f
Oswald heaves an exaggerated sigh and waves goodbye.

TAG: Oswald_018_f
With a slump of his shoulders, the rabbit unveils that he has picked Rock.

TAG: Oswald_019_f
With a slump of his shoulders, the rabbit unveils that he has picked Paper.
