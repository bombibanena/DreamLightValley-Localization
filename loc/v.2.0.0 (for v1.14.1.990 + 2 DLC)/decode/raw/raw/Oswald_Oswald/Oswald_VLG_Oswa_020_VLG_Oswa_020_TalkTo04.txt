TAG: Oswald_008_f
But say, now that the caper's concluded...

TAG: Oswald_009_f
How's about you help me set things straight with Stitch?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Oh yeah, that's right. You two are getting along nicely, aren't you?

Gee whillikers, that'd be poi-fect!

TAG: Oswald_015_f

Why don't you think of something special to add to the picnic setup?

TAG: Oswald_019_f
You got it, chum! I'll put the ol' conker to work and come up with somethin' snazzy!

TAG: Oswald_020_f
