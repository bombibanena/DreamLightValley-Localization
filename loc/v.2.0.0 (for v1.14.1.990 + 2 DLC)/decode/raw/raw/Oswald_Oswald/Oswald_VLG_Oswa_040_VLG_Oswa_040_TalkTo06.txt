OK, we've got our landing strip. I hope this works!

TAG: Oswald_003_f
I triple-kissed my foot for luck, so we're sittin' pretty, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Oswald_000_f
Plus, I added a few bones to the landing strip. Trolleys are kinda like dogs, so I'm hopin' they'll help lure it down.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Hotsy-totsy! Look! The trolley's comin' over!

TAG: Oswald_005_f
It's back!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
Gee, trolley, you had me worried sick! Waitâ Bad trolley! Tsk, tsk, tsk. That was TOO naughty!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Does that work? Chastizing it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah! I was worried too!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Prob'ly not. Trolleys can be stubborn as a mule at the dentist.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Still, I think the trolley learned its lesson bein' lost for so long.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
It should be trained enough now so you can make its home wherever you'd like, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I think I'm starting to understand your logic after all this time...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I still don't get your logic, Oswald.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
... Logic?

TAG: Oswald_013_f
You've gotta admit, the world seems to work on different rules around you.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Drawing your House in three dimensions...

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Your alarm clocks coming alive and running amok...

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Having to re-vulcanize your limbs...

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Whattaya mean? Don't other folks do that?

TAG: Oswald_024_f
Thanks, chum. This has been the best welcome to a new home this lucky rabbit's ever had.

TAG: Oswald_018_f
And a trolley coming alive and taking to the skies?!

TAG: Oswald_019_f
Yeah, that was kinda unusual.

TAG: Oswald_020_f
In my experience, trolleys mostly prefer the ground. Course this is a magical place...

TAG: Oswald_021_f
Oswaldian logic and Dreamlight Magic â what a combination!

TAG: Oswald_022_f
Well, I'll let you relax after we ran ourselves ragged chasing after the trolley.

TAG: Oswald_023_f
Sheesh. Yeah, I could really use some shut-eye.

TAG: Oswald_001_f
But before I hit the hay, I have a reward for YOU â something real stylish!

TAG: Oswald_012_f
One genuine zoot suit!

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Hey, I handed out my sorries for that!

TAG: Oswald_017_f
Aw, I don't need it often, but when I do, it makes me feel like a million bucks!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
See? You worried poor, {PlayerName}!
