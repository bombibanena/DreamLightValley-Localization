Oswald! How are you doing?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Oswald gives you a grin bigger than a brass band! He mimes two people walking about arm in arm.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
You want to spend some time together?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'm busy now â I'll be back later.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
What do you want to do?

TAG: Oswald_004_f
The charming bunny examines you and regards his own stylish allure. He points to himself then tips an imaginary hat.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
He points to you and brushes some miniscule specks of dirt off of his imaginary sleeve.

TAG: Oswald_006_f
You have some thoughts on my clothes?

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Oswald nods furiously and does a few steps of a Charleston, pointing at his shorts.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You want to dance?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I should dress like you?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oswald shakes his head with the overblown sadness of a silent film actor.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
All right, I'm off â see you in a bit!

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Should I put on some different clothes?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Oswald grins, jumps up, and spins his ears!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
OK, I can see what I have in my wardrobe.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
I feel like we should match â I'll find a <Lore>black shirt and light-colored pants</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_017_f
A <ActivityItem>Black and White Fedora</ActivityItem>? Oswald, this looks great! I'll totally wear this too.

TAG: Oswald_014_f
Oswald is so excited that he jumps out of his shoes!

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Luckily, they position themselves so that Oswald lands back in them cleanly.
