All right, here are the remaining fugitives!

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Aces!

TAG: Player_002_f
I gotta be honest with you, Oswald...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Those are the cutest clocks I've ever seen!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
The constant ringing was SUPER annoying.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
You need to take better care of them.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Hey, it ain't my fault they went on the lam!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're the one that animated them, not me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not so sure about that...

TAG: Oswald_005_f
But I... Well, I... Ya see, it's like this â I was just tryin' to make 'em more fun!

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Oh, great idea! Maybe he can tell them a story or something.

TAG: Oswald_014_f
That's the ticket! C'mon, let's make tracks!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
But Oswald... what if they escape again?

TAG: Oswald_007_f
We can't have them constantly running amok in Eternity Isle!

TAG: Oswald_017_f
They've already been waking people up!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Gee. *sigh* I guess you're right, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
They sure like gallivantin'.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Who knows? They might cheese it the next chance they get.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Yeah, we need to get them to calm down.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Hmm... I know! We gotta <Lore>talk to Olaf</Lore>!

TAG: Oswald_003_f
I couldn't imagine trying to relax with those running around outside.
