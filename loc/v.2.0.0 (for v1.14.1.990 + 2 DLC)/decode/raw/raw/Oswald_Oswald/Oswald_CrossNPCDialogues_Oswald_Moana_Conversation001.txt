Hey Moana, what's the haps?

TAG: Oswald_000_f
Oh, I was just wondering how Heihei's doing.

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Heihei...? OH! You told me about him. Your little rooster friend, right?

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Yep. I worry about him. He's not exactly... self-sufficient.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Well, I happen to have loads of experience with poultry! When I worked on a farm, I ran a dating service for chickens.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
You did? How did that work?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Not so good. I struggled to make hens meet. Oh-hoo-hoo!
