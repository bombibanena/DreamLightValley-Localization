Hey Oswald, what's new?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
What's new? Gee, I guess ya could say, I'm feelin' my oats! Ready to take on the world!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
I need a challenge. Whaddaya say, wanna join me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure, let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's discuss this later.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh, of course.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Re-whatnow?

TAG: Oswald_007_f
What do you have in mind?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Well, first I gotta get into tip-top shape.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
You don't feel ready?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Oh, I'm rarin' to go!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
But my arms and legs are feelin' a little loose.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Like rubber hoses, I tell ya. And I need 'em to be mighty limbs of stone!

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Yeah, I guess you are pretty wiggly. How do we tighten you up?

TAG: Oswald_014_f
Simple â I gotta <Lore>revulcanize my limbs</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
So how do we do that?

TAG: Oswald_018_f
I just happen to know a 100%-guaranteed method of strength building.

TAG: Oswald_019_f
But it's gonna take an extra hot heat.

TAG: Oswald_020_f
Hmm, so we should make a fire?

TAG: Oswald_021_f
Nah, I gotta have the heat INSIDE.

TAG: Oswald_022_f
I'm thinkin' <ActivityItem>Tandoori Chicken</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>5 Chili Peppers</ActivityItem> should do the trick.

TAG: Oswald_023_f
On it!

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Revulcanize! Ya know, like rubber. Aw, maybe that's too much of a sophisticated term for ya.

TAG: Oswald_017_f
Oh that's definitely it.
