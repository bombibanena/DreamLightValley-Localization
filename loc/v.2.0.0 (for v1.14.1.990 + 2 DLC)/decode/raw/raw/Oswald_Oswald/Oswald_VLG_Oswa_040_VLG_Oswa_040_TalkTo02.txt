Leapin' lizards! Did ya see that?!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
No, I turned around for just a second â what happened?

TAG: Oswald_019_f
The trolley's gone!

TAG: Oswald_005_f
I think the poor thing got scared and amscrayed!

Oh no, what do we do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It was that quick?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
We gotta act fast. Trolleys are bunk at knowin' which way to go.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Ya got any ideas?

TAG: Oswald_012_f
What if we put up "Missing" posters and leverage the community to help?

{PlayerName}, that's genius!

TAG: Oswald_014_f
I'm startin' to get why you're the big cheese around here.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
I bet you <Lore>Rapunzel can help with the posters</Lore>.

Aces! And then maybe you can catch an <ActivityItem>Octopus or two for their ink</ActivityItem> plus some <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood</ActivityItem> to make some frames?

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Great, I'll start on that!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
You betcha! When trolleys get a notion to fast-track it, hold onto your hat!
