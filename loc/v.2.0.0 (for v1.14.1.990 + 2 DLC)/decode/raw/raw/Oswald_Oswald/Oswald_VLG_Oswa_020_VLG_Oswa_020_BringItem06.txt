Hi, Mr. McDuck. Oswald and I have a little something for you.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Oswald wants to make amends for his alarm clocks waking you up.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Aye, they did ruin my beauty sleep!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
So what are you and the rabbit offering?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Some coffee! Oswald has a special recipe for <ActivityItem>Black (and White) Coffee</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
We thought it might help with any tiredness you might be experiencing right now.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
A word of warning, though â it's Oswald's recipe and it comes with some... unique effects.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Och, I'm sleepy enough to risk it, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
All right, let me taste this coffee... *sip sip*

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
<i>Boy howdy! I haven't had a nibble like that in a dog's age!</i>

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
There we go; right on schedule.

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
Aye, well it seems to have worn off now.

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
But thank you, {PlayerName}, and Oswald. That coffee certainly perked me up!

TAG: Scrooge_020_f
How odd...

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
<i>The coffee's going straight to the ol' conker!</i>

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
What am I sayin'?

TAG: Scrooge_021_f
<i>Time to hit the dance hall and cut a rug!</i>

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Mr. McDuck? You OK?

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Well, pluck my tail feathers and call me baldy!

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
I haven't heard talk like that since the great crash of '29!

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
Yeah, Oswald's way of speaking is kinda infectious...

TAG: Scrooge_019_f
Oh no, Mr. McDuck; are you all right? What's going on?

TAG: Scrooge_022_f
Oswald's going to have a lot to answer to!
