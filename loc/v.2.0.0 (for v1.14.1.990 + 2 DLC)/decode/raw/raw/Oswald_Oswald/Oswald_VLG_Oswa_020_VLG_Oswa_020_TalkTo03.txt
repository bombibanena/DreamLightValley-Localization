So chum, how'd ya like Olaf's story?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Kinda reminded me of Pinocchio.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm feeling kinda sleepy now...

TAG: Oswald_003_f
It worked like a charm. All the clock tots are snoozin' off to dream land!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Perfect!

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Okey-dokey then, I'll be offâ

TAG: Oswald_006_f
No, no, you wait here â we have things to discuss!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Uh... We do?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Your alarm clocks woke up a bunch of people. We can't just leave them to be sleep deprived!

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Gee, when ya put it that way...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Let me tell you which poor Villagers got woken up.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
The Villagers are wandering around like zombies now!

TAG: Oswald_001_f
I saw Merlin looking so sleepy that he thought a capybara challenged him to a wizard duel!

TAG: Oswald_014_f
We woke folks up, so let's bring 'em each a cup o' joe!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What if they don't like coffee?

TAG: Oswald_021_f
Gaston actually said he was too tired for five dozen eggs and only ate four dozen when he went to Remy's.

TAG: Oswald_022_f
Scrooge McDuck thought he was back in Glasgow for a moment!

TAG: Oswald_023_f
And don't get me started on Rapunzel â she mixed blue and yellow paint together to try and get red!

TAG: Oswald_024_f
Yikes, that does sound serious!

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Yeah, we're doing an apology tour.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Buckle up, Oswald; we need to go make amends.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Any ideas?

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Lemme just get the ol' wheels turnin'... Hmm... I got it!

TAG: Oswald_015_f
I've got my own secret recipe for <ActivityItem>Strong Black (and White) Coffee</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_017_f
But I'll need some <ActivityItem>Coal<ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Pearls</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Oswaldian Garlic</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Coal, pearls, and garlic for coffee?!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'm learning not to ask questions when it comes to you...

TAG: Oswald_018_f
None of those are COFFEE Ingredients.

TAG: Oswald_027_f
The coal's to get it nice and roasty, and the pearls are for servin' it up.

TAG: Oswald_028_f
Seems like there might be an easier way, but I'll go with you. Wait â what about the garlic?

TAG: Oswald_029_f
It's gotta be black and white, right? The coal is black and the garlic's white. Naturally!

TAG: Oswald_019_f
Why don't you just use milk for the white part?

TAG: Oswald_030_f
Aw, everybody knows milk in coffee just makes it brown. But garlic â that floats around for that nice dappled look!

TAG: Oswald_020_f
OK, I get you. This doesn't make regular-sense, but it does make Oswald-sense.

TAG: Oswald_031_f
I'll be back soon with the coffees!

TAG: Oswald_032_f
Great! Here's the garlic!

TAG: Oswald_000_f
It'll be aces; you'll see!

TAG: Oswald_026_f
My <ActivityItem>Black (and White) Coffee</ActivityItem> can't be beat!

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Oh, my coffee'll turn any tea-sipper into a cup o' joe chugger!

TAG: Oswald_025_f
Maybe they're just goin' for some restful strolls?
