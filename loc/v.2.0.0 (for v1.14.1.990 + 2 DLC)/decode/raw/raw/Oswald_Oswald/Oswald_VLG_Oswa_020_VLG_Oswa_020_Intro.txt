How are you settling in, Oswald?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Well, it's like this, chum... My House is real swell! When I bunk down, I'm out like a candle in a swimmin' pool.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
But... it's TOO comfortable. I keep sleepin' in till half past the rooster's nap!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Well, let's see what we can do about that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That sounds like a problem for future {PlayerName}.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Though, I suppose a bunch of alarm clocks might work.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Sure!

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Lemme get ahold of some <ActivityItem>Mechanical Parts</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Bronze Ingots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Plastic Scraps</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Zinc</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_014_f
I should be able to craft a bunch of alarm clocks with that.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
That'd be peachy! Thanks, chum. Guess you're not one to beat your gums â you mean business.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Are you missing out on something important when you sleep in?

TAG: Oswald_004_f
You betcha I am! It's that furry blue fellow, Stitch.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
I tell ya, one chin session, and I knew we were two sides of the same silver dollar.

TAG: Oswald_006_f
But he rises earlier than the moon sets!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Ah, I see the problem.

TAG: Oswald_008_f
What if we try to get ahold of an alarm clock for you?

TAG: Oswald_009_f
... Just one?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
{PlayerName}, when I'm snoozin', it'll take a brass band to get through these ears.
