How was your picnic?

Gee, {PlayerName}, it was swell!

Stitch thought I was a dewdropper, but now he knows I was just gettin' some extra winks.

We're gonna schedule our brunches for after lunch now.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Glad to help!

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Now, have we learned our lessons about building household objects that run off on their own?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
You betcha!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
And the lesson is that it's a riot!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No, that wasn't the lesson...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
OK, it was pretty funny...

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Okey-dokey. I understand.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
If I want your help again, I gotta be on the level.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
I... You know what? Close enough.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Have fun with Stitch!

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Thanks! Oh, and here, take this... I ain't gonna need ALL the alarm clocks.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
But you need to be more considerate.
