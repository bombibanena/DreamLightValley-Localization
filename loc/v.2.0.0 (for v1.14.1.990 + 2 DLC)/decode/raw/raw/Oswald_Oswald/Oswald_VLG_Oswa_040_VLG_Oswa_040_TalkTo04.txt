Picture taken! Should we do a brainstorm to get some ideas on how to get the trolley back down?

TAG: Oswald_003_f
A storm? Sheesh, that could hurt the trolley! Nah, I got a better idea.

TAG: Oswald_000_f
Cooking!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
My plan's gonna need <ActivityItem>Paper</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Dates</ActivityItem>, and a <ActivityItem>Nestling Pear</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
I'm so confused â why do we want these?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
The paper's so we got somethin' with the plan written on it.

TAG: Oswald_007_f
The dates 'cause we hafta do this lickety-split!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
And the nestling pear's 'cause the trolley's prob'ly gettin' tired. It'll need someplace to get a few winks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh, that makes total sense.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You... feeling OK, Oswald?

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Well, I have no idea how this is gonna turn out...

TAG: Oswald_010_f
But I'll try cooking up that plan for you.

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

Me? Whatcha worryin' about me for? Worry about the trolley!
