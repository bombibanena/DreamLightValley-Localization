Huh... that didn't exactly go how I was expecting.

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Aces! That House is berries!

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Sheesh... and flatter than a flapjack.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Will that be a problem?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What should we do?

TAG: Oswald_003_f
I'm thinkin', yeah.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Glasses? Hotsy-totsy! You're a wisehead, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I am?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Of course I am!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
I can always iron myself flat...

TAG: Oswald_005_f
...but what about when I got guests?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
We gotta find ourselves a third dimension!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Hmm... But how? I think that pencil's all used up.

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Don't be sad, Oswald. We'll get your House figured out.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Me? I'm not worried. I got luck on my side!

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Wait â didn't I tell ya my full name? I'm Oswald the Lucky Rabbit!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Well, glad to hear that you don't have rose-colored glasses when it comes to your sense of self...

TAG: Oswald_013_f
You betcha!

TAG: Oswald_014_f
O' course, I am ALSO supremely savvy for leading ya to the answer.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Indubitably, we gotta give the House a third dimension! It's missin' depth!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Of course. Why didn't we think of that sooner?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Excuse me, what?

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Sometimes ya gotta take a hop back and see the whole picture.

TAG: Oswald_017_f
We just need a pair of <ActivityItem>3D Glasses</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Oswald_018_f
Hmm, where could we find one of those?

TAG: Oswald_019_f
{PlayerName}, my luck don't ever end! Why, just yesterday, I helped Mr. McDuck dig out a whole caboodle of antiques!

TAG: Oswald_020_f
Just yesterday, huh? I bet he hasn't had a chance to sort and set out the stock on display in his store.

TAG: Oswald_021_f
Yeah, he was goin' on and on about how all that stuff'd be worth a bucket o' cabbage.

TAG: Oswald_022_f
Hmm, OK, I'll make sure to bring <Lore>at least one thousand and fifty Star Coins</Lore> â who knows how expensive it'll be!

TAG: Oswald_024_f
Yep, you're cannier than a can of beans!
