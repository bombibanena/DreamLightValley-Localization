OK Oswald, what did you bring?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Not to toot my own horn, but I've got some LOVELY gems for EVE to give WALLÂ·E.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Gems, huh? Oh-hoo-hoo! Have I got you beat, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Really now! What did you get?

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Coal!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
... Coal?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Wow, I'm so scared of losing...

TAG: Oswald_005_f
WALLÂ·E's a compactor, ain't he?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
This way he can make his own diamonds!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Uhh, not sure he can compact things that tightly.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Well, let's hand off our stuff to EVE and she can judge the winner!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Ah, don't worry, {PlayerName}. We can still be chums after you lose.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
How... gracious of you.
