Oswald grins and begins to do a soft-shoe shuffle to put the best hoofer to shame!

TAG: Player_000_f
You want to dance?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, kinda busy at the moment.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
All right, show me some moves!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Let's do the Charleston!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Time for a little Turkey Trot!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Do you know hip-hop dance?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Oswald begins to cut a rug, each foot kicking out at the knee as he dances, his arms out to the sides.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Not bad!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Oswald, that's amazing!

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Were this rabbit capable of blushing, his face would be scarlet!

TAG: Oswald_003_f
As is, a gray flush is creeping up his cheeks.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Oswald trots back and forth, kicks his legs out to the sides and then poses with his arms bent at the elbows.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Oswald seems a little stumped until an idea exclamation point appears over his head!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
Never one to let anatomy hold him back, Oswald plucks off a leg and then attaches it at a right angle from his hip.

TAG: Oswald_007_f
He then begins to hop around on his hip-leg, looking at you with a wry grin as if asking, "This is what you meant, right?"

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Close enough!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Points for effort.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Oh, wow, no...

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oswald jumps for joy, forgetting his missing leg. He somersaults, reattaches his leg where it belongs, and bounces up with a smile. Ta-da!

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Oswald laughs and gives you a little wink.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Was he winding you up this whole time? Oswald sure isn't telling...

TAG: Oswald_011_f
With the utmost disappointment in his eyes, the little rabbit gives you a brave smile.
