Hi EVE!

TAG: EVE_008_f
Do you want us to do something involving mining?

TAG: EVE_009_f
*digital beeps* WALLÂ·E!

TAG: EVE_010_f
Oh, are you making a gift for WALLÂ·E? Is there a particular kind of gem you want?

TAG: EVE_011_f
Classified.

TAG: EVE_012_f
You know what? I'll get you some gems from each Biome â <ActivityItem>Spinels</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Bumblestone</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Evergems</ActivityItem> are all pretty.

TAG: EVE_013_f
Can you let Oswald know what he needs to find as well? Something tells me he'll be able to understand you just fine.

TAG: EVE_014_f
Directive!

TAG: EVE_000_f
Oh! *digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_001_f
Oswald and I are having a contest of sorts.

TAG: EVE_002_f
Would you be interested in setting a task for us and then judging the results?

TAG: EVE_003_f
Hmm...

TAG: EVE_004_f
Directive!

TAG: EVE_005_f
That sounds like a yes to me! What do you want us to do?

TAG: EVE_006_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: EVE_007_f
Huh, your targeting scanner is moving over my Pickaxe.
