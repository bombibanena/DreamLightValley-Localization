Oh... oh, hello.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
How did you get down here?

TAG: Oswald_003_f
The peculiar rabbit stares at you, without moving a muscle or making a sound.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Uh... okay.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That was weird.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do you have a name?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Can you talk?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
The charming bystander breaks out in a wide grin.

TAG: Oswald_006_f
"Name's Oswald! Pleased to meet ya!"

TAG: Oswald_000_f
The bunny-eared fella doffs his ears to you.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Uh... okay.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You're a little odd, aren't you?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I love your style!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
The rabbit does a little jitterbug dance.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
I'll have to look for some way to <Lore>repair that lever</Lore>...

TAG: Oswald_010_f
You've been down here a long time, huh?

TAG: Oswald_016_f
The bunny laughs.

TAG: Oswald_018_f
"You betcha I have! I took one wrong turn tunnelin' for gold, and I've been stuck down here ever since!"

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Do you know what this place is? Or how I can get across these platforms to reach the Spark of Imagination?

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Oswald gestures emphatically towards the stone bridge and a missing lever.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
"This whole place needs fixin'!"

TAG: Oswald_014_f
Guess that's all I'm gonna get outta you, huh?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
With his hands on his hips, the annoyed rabbit asks:

TAG: Oswald_017_f
"Hey, who you callin' odd?!"

TAG: Oswald_009_f
The rabbit smiles and takes a bow.
