Hey, Mother Gothel... you and I need to have a little chat.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
What is it, dear? Come to compliment me on my brilliant wit and beguiling charm?

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
No. I wanted to talk to you about what you did to the Forgotten.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Oh, this isn't about that little curse, is it? That was ages ago.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Really, the two of you MUST learn to let things go.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What you did was not okay.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm giving you a chance to make this better.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Actually, when you think about it, I was the only one looking out for the Forgotten. I wanted to keep them safe!

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
They need a good rhyme for "told"...

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
All right. But first, tell me... why did you come to me with this verse?

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
It's about being afraid of getting older, so I thoughtâ

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Me? Afraid of something as inconsequential as that. Oh darling, don't be ridiculous. I never give it a thought.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
You tell the Forgotten that time passes. But it's how you spend the time that matters! Simply do all that's possible to look after yourself.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
There's nothing magical about it. Of course, it does help to be devastatingly charming. After all, charm never gets old.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
Wait... Mother Gothel... that's it! That's a perfect rhyme!

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
<Lore>I've never been one to do what I'm told...</Lore>

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
<Lore>I'll care for myself. Charm will never grow old!</Lore>

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
... Of course it's perfect. It's from me!

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Not buying it. But there's one way you can make it up to the Forgotten.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Fine. Tell me what it is.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
The Forgotten needs help with some poetry.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Well, why didn't you say so?

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
The Forgotten needs help with this verse...

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
<Lore>As I watch the clock tick and the sun rise and set...</Lore>

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
<Lore>I fear what I love, I am doomed to forget.</Lore>

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
<Lore>But I've never been one to do what I'm told...</Lore>
