Oh! Now I remember!

TAG: Donald_007_f
Before the Forgetting, I did ALL the planning for the Village. I came up with lots of super-genius special projects.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You'd be great at that! You've got a big imagination.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Er... no offense, but that's a little surprising.

TAG: Donald_001_f
You bet I do! And it's fun to think of stuff to help the Village.

TAG: Donald_004_f
Before the Forgetting, I was planning something big. Something huge! Something stupendous!

TAG: Donald_008_f
But then the Night Thorns started to show up everywhere, and I forgot it all.

TAG: Donald_005_f
I hid everything I needed to make my ideas in <ActivityItem>Time Capsules</ActivityItem> all over the Village.

TAG: Donald_006_f
But now I don't remember where I hid them... or what I was trying to build.

TAG: Donald_002_f
I gotta find more of 'em! Thanks for all your help, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Any time, Donald!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Just don't get so mad next time.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We better not ask Mr. McDuck for help again.

TAG: Donald_010_f
Awww.

TAG: Donald_011_f
You're right. I'll try to control my temper.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Oh, he just bellyaches a lot. Uncle Scrooge always helps when it counts.

TAG: Donald_003_f
You're a little... impulsive. I don't think of you as much of a planner.

TAG: Donald_009_f
Hey, I've got great ideas! It's just... sometimes I need help making them happen.
