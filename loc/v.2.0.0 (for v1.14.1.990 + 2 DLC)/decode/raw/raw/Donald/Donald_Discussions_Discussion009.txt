Hey, {PlayerName}, I'm goin' fishin', and I wanna bring a snack in case I get hungry.

TAG: Donald_001_f
What would you take for a fishing snack?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Grilled cheese!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Salad!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why not eat the fish you catch?

TAG: Donald_002_f
Grilled cheese?! That's my favorite! Especially with lots of toppings.

TAG: Donald_003_f
It's easy to make and always delicious.

TAG: Donald_004_f
What do you like on yours?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Tomatoes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Mustard.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Nothing.

TAG: Donald_007_f
Me too! Let's have a grilled cheese party sometime, pal!

TAG: Donald_008_f
Yeah, I like mustard, too. Especially the spicy kind!

TAG: Donald_009_f
Just a plain grilled cheese? Not even onions? I don't get it.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Salad? WAK! Salad's not a snack!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Salads can be tasty!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Yeesh, sorry.

TAG: Donald_015_f
Hmmm... Well, maybe a nice seaweed salad made from all the seaweed I usually catch could be good.

TAG: Donald_016_f
Aw, it's okay, {PlayerName}. I'm just cranky because I'm hungry.

TAG: Donald_010_f
But what if I don't catch anything?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Hmm... good point.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Have some confidence!

TAG: Donald_012_f
Guess I could eat the seaweed I always catch...

TAG: Donald_013_f
You're right! I'm gonna catch a bunch of fish and eat 'em all! If I don't believe in me, nobody will!
