Hey, Donald, check this out.

TAG: Donald_000_f
Huh? What's this?

TAG: Donald_002_f
WAK! It's a note from me!

TAG: Donald_003_f
I mean, me in the past. Even before the Forgetting, I left myself notes so I'd always remember things.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's a good habit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're odd.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What's it say?

TAG: Donald_006_f
Yeah, I've got tons of 'em!

TAG: Donald_008_f
C'mon, let's read the note and see what I wanted to be sure I'd remember...

TAG: Donald_010_f
It's a reminder that I was planning to build something in the Forgotten Lands.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That place could sure use some work to brighten it up.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why would you build something in that awful place?

TAG: Donald_011_f
That's just what I thought.

TAG: Donald_020_f
It says I buried the instructions for how to make the fountain there.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Umm... You lead the way, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Donald_017_f
It's not that I'm scared of the Forgotten Lands but... um... it's your turn to lead!

TAG: Donald_018_f
Sure, I can do that.

TAG: Donald_023_f
Phew!

TAG: Donald_019_f
All right then. Follow me. Let's go search the Forgotten Lands.

TAG: Donald_025_f
Hey, I wonder if it was that fountain we found the pieces for...

TAG: Donald_024_f
WAK! I remember now!

TAG: Donald_013_f
I was planning to build a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fountain</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Donald_014_f
That sounds amazing!

TAG: Donald_015_f
So how do we finish it?

TAG: Donald_016_f
We have to find the rest of my instructions...

TAG: Donald_004_f
My note says there's another campsite in the Forgotten Lands <Lore>near the Ruins</Lore>...

TAG: Donald_009_f
That must be near where you were planning to build the fountain.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Why do you think? To make it LESS awful.

TAG: Donald_007_f
No, I'm not! Haven't you ever heard of a to-do list?
