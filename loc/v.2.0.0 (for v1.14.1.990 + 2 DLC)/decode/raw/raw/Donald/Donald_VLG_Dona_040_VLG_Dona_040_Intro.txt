Hey, {PlayerName}! I know how we can finish my special project! Do you have time to help me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure. How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll come back later.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Well, I was marching around the Sunlit Plateau, keeping an eye out for any sign of trouble...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's awfully brave of you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Keep YOURSELF out of trouble, okay?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Did you find anything?

TAG: Donald_011_f
You're always looking out for ways to help the Village. It's inspiring.

TAG: Donald_007_f
Well, I'm very inspirational! Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Donald_012_f
So, what did you find on the Sunlit Plateau?

TAG: Donald_013_f
I found an old campsite.

TAG: Donald_006_f
I think it was the one Kristoff and I made when we were on our quest to save the Village from the Forgetting.

TAG: Donald_004_f
I remember I hid something very important there. Follow me! We can search for it together.

TAG: Donald_008_f
The last time you went out trying to save the Village, you jumped through a Dark Portal and got lost in another world.

TAG: Donald_009_f
So... just be careful.

TAG: Donald_010_f
I don't know what you're talking about. That worked out fine.

TAG: Donald_003_f
You don't have time to help?! Then how come you're talking to me?!
