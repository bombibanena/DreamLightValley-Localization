Hey, I've been asking around the Village about that <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem> we found. Do you have time to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Of course! What did you learn?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Maybe later.

TAG: Donald_001_f
We couldn't open it because Merlin enchanted it!

TAG: Donald_002_f
I gave it to him, and he's gonna try to remember how to open it.

TAG: Donald_003_f
I'll go talk to Merlin and see if he's figured it out.

Fine. But come back soon. {PlayerName}. This is serious!
