You won't believe what I fished up on Dazzle Beach the other day, {PlayerName}.

A <ActivityItem>Kingfish</ActivityItem>! It weighed a whole fifty pounds! And was twice as long as your arms!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Wow! That's amazing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds a little fishy...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I've never seen a fish like that on Dazzle Beach...

TAG: Donald_002_f
You could try and catch one yourself. But it'll never be as big as the one I caught.

Just try fishing off Dazzle Beach. Oh, and as a brilliant fisherman, I know that they only come out at night.

TAG: Donald_004_f
What?! You don't believe me?!

Go see for yourself and catch one if you're such a fishing expert!
