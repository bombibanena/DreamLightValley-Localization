Hey, {PlayerName}, I've been trying to make some good meals...

TAG: Donald_001_f
...but every time I throw stuff in a pot, all I get is crackers.

TAG: Donald_002_f
Crackers, crackers, crackers!

TAG: Player_000_f
Sounds like you need to...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...just keep experimenting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...try some different ingredients.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...follow the recipes more closely.

TAG: Donald_003_f
No way! I'm not messing around anymore. I've got enough crackers.

There must be something wrong with the ingredients Goofy sold me.

TAG: Donald_005_f
I'm gonna go give him a piece of my mind!

TAG: Donald_006_f
Of course! I'm not doing anything wrong. It's the ingredients!

TAG: Donald_007_f
What?! You think I don't know how to read a recipe?! No way.
