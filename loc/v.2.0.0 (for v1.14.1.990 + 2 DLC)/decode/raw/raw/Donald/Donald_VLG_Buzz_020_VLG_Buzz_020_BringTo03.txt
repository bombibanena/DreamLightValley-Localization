Huh?!

TAG: Donald_001_f
What's this? A bunch of funny pictures of Buzz?

TAG: Player_002_f
It's a <ActivityItem>Buzz Lightyear Leaflet</ActivityItem>. I'm trying to spread the word about all his most daring feats. Like his...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...many heroic rescue missions.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...exploration of Al's Toy Barn.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...encounters with a nefarious bear named Lotso.

Well, I bet he hasn't done anything as brave as helping me get outta the Dark Grove.

TAG: Donald_018_f
Since you did that for me, and since you obviously need some help, I'll tell everybody about Buzz and his Space Rangers.

TAG: Donald_016_f
So, he's an explorer, huh?

TAG: Donald_019_f
Well, I've had my share of adventures too, you know.

TAG: Donald_020_f
Hey, maybe I could be a Space Ranger!

TAG: Donald_009_f
But in the meantime, I'll tell everybody about Buzz Lightyear and Star Command.

TAG: Donald_017_f
Then maybe he can do something about all the villains in this Village. Like Ursula!

TAG: Donald_021_f
I just know she's up to no good. In fact, I've been thinkin' about havin' a little talk with her myself.

TAG: Donald_022_f
And I'll tell everybody about Buzz and Star Command. I just hope it's enough to make the villains behave.
