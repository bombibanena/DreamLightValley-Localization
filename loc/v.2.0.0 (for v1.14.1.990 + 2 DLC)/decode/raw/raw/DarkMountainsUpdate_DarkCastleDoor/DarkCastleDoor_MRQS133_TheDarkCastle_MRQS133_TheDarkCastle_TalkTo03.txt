What's this? Who has come to wake me?

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_001_f
Ohhhh! It's you! Er, I mean... Your Most Humble Highness... Only say the word and I'll do your bidding without so much as squeaking my hinge!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How did you learn to talk?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Don't you get bored just standing here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let me pass.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_003_f
Why... you taught me, of course.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_004_f
Once I was nothing but a slab of iron with a handle.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_005_f
But then I awoke to the sound of your voice whispering an enchantment. I've stood here ever since.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_007_f
Bored? Well, no. It's peaceful here. Doors don't need much excitement, you know.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_009_f
All the exciting things are usually on the other side of us. That is the fate of a door. To always be stuck in between.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_008_f
Mostly I sleep until you wake me to let you pass.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_010_f
Of course, Your Highness, I shallâ

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_011_f
Wait a moment... It's so hard to see you, squinting through my keyhole...

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_012_f
You look like yourself... but something is different. Something is wrong.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Uh... I'm trying out a new look...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
How dare you! Step aside and let me pass.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_013_f
And it quite suits you. Humans are so complex. You look one way one day and another the next.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_002_f
Hrm... hrm... but you ARE wearing <Lore>wings and a crown</Lore> just like my creator...

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_020_f
For now... I shall swing open and let you proceed.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_019_f
But if you're trying to deceive... if you're not my creator... then you'll surely fail to pass through one of the next doors.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_016_f
But I'm afraid we doors are quite simple. We are either open or shut, locked or unlocked.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_015_f
I am shut. For you have told me never to let you pass <Lore>without your wings and crown</Lore>...

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_014_f
Humans are so complex. One demand one day. Another the next.
