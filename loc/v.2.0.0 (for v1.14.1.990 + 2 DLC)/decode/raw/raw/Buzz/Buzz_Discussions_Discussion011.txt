{PlayerName}, I could use your help resolving a disagreement.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Which is more difficult? Riding a horse or piloting an interstellar starcraft?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Piloting an interstellar starcraft.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Riding a horse.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They're both hard in their own ways.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
That's exactly what I think. Intergalactic flight is a complex endeavor.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
You have to account for thrust, velocity, coordinates, orientation, asteroids... The list goes on.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
With a horse, you just pull the ropes and the horse does all the work.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They're called reins.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's not easy to keep control of a horse.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Buzz, are you and Woody debating again?

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Well, whatever they're called, they're not as complex as the steering interface of an interstellar craft.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
*sigh* I suppose that's true. Maybe I've underestimated the difficulty.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Thanks for the perspective, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
... How did you know?

TAG: Buzz_004_f
I have to disagree. Riding a horse is not a complicated process at all.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
It's entirely straightforward. You only move in two dimensions!
