Mission accomplished, cadet!

Peace has been restored in the Village. And from what I hear, Maui and Donald have already started spreading the good word about Star Command.

And Ursula seems to have gotten the message. I've had no reports of any schemes by her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Glad I could be of service.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's our next mission?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Be careful with Ursula. She's only pretending.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I'll let you know when I find a new mission for us.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
I haven't found it yet, but I'll be sure to tell you as soon as I do! Thanks again, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
That's the thing about villains. They pretend to stop their scheming, but it never lasts.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
I'm sure Ursula will go back to her old ways... and we'll be there to ruin her plans.
