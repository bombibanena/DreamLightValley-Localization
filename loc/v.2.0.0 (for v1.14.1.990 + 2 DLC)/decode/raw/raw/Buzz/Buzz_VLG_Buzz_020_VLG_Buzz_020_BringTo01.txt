Excellent work, cadet. When they see these, no one will doubt that Space Rangers are a force to be reckoned with...

In fact, I'll personally deliver one to Ursula.

TAG: Player_000_f
How about I take it to Ursula...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're too high-ranking for a job like this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's a good task for a cadet.

So you don't end up in her garden.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Smart thinking. Perhaps encountering a cadet instead of an officer will convince her that we don't regard her as a threat.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
And if her intimidation tactics don't scare us... That might be enough to deter her from her nefarious plans.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Great way to show initiative, cadet.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Since you've proven yourself, I'll let you pick two other Villagers to help spread the word about Star Command.

TAG: Player_001_f
I'll go with Maui and Donald. They're...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Both heroes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The ones who come to mind.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Boastful enough to spread the word.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Then they're sure to appreciate Star Command's mission to help. I approve.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Well, Woody always says to trust your inner voice. I approve.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Then I'm sure everyone will know about our Space Ranger initiative in no time.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
You're right. Great way to show initiative, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Your courage is admirable, cadet. Being ready to risk Ursula's wrath on one of your very first missions... I'm impressed.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Well, if you're ready to take on this challenge then go ahead.
