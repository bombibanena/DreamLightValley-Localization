{PlayerName}, I was hoping we could run through a short training scenario together.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
I'll play a Space Ranger patrolling the sector for signs of villainy. You'll be one of the minions of the evil Emperor Zurg.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Initiate training scenario.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Initiating training scenario XR-452...

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Ahem... <Lore>"Halt! There's a warrant out for your arrest in ten sectors!"</Lore>

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
"You'll never apprehend me, Lightyear! Take this! Pew pew!"

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
"Buzz... I am your best friend."

TAG: Buzz_004_f
<Lore>"Deflector shields to maximum power!"</Lore>

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
"Lasers to maximum power PLUS TEN!"

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
"Oh yeah? Well, I'll turn on my EXTRA SPECIAL deflector shields!"

TAG: Player_002_choice_004_f
I get on my horse and ride away.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
<Lore>"Gah! Agh! Curse your state of the art laser technology!"</Lore>

TAG: Buzz_007_f
End scenario. Excellent work, {PlayerName}. I'll need to keep honing my skills to have a hope of defeating you.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Let's do this again sometime.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
<Lore>"Gah! Agh! Your lasers have rebounded on me just as I lowered my deflector shields."</Lore>

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Wait just a nanosecond... Pause training scenario...

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Horses are more of a Sheriff Woody thing.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
They're well outside the parameters of this simulation.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
<Lore>"My best friend...? What sort of devious lie is that? Did Zurg tell you to say that?"</Lore>

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
"You got me. Guess I'll just have to blast you with my laser!"

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
"Search your feelings. You know it to be true."

TAG: Buzz_014_f
<Lore>"Can it be possible...?"</Lore>

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
"Ha! I tricked you into letting your deflector shields down! Eat laser beams!"

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
"We've got a lot of catching up to do."

TAG: Buzz_015_f
<Lore>"Gah! Agh! Your diabolical ruse got me to lower my deflector shields just long enough to fire your lasers on me."</Lore>

TAG: Buzz_016_f
Wait, wait... Pause training scenario...

TAG: Buzz_017_f
This whole simulation is so implausible that I question its utility for training purposes.

TAG: Buzz_018_f
Perhaps we can run it again once we do some retooling.

TAG: Buzz_020_f
Of course, {PlayerName}.
