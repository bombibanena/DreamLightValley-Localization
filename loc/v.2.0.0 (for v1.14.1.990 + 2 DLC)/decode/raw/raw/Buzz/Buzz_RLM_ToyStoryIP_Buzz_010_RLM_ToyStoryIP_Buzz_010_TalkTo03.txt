They're small toy cactuses that Bonnie received as a gift. When you add water, they grow.

If we place them under the race car tracks... add a little liquid...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...they'll grow and lift up the race car tracks! Great plan.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...they'll get all soggy and we'll have a real mess on our hands?

TAG: Buzz_003_f
But some of them aren't at the right height. What are we supposed to do now?

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Hmm... Let me think... I've got it! We'll use the local vegetation to help us.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
Vegetation? Like plants?

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Precisely. There are some <ActivityItem>Magic Growing Cactuses</ActivityItem> scattered around the room.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
<ActivityItem>Magic Growing Cactuses...?</ActivityItem> What are those?

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Don't let the name fool you. They're not really magic, but they are quite a feat of engineering.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Exactly. You certainly have a knack for this kind of thing, my friend.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
However, there is one problem â the water. I'm not exactly a fully waterproof toy...

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Don't worry. My trusty Watering Can will take care of that.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
Excellent! Then let's <Lore>find those <ActivityItem>Magic Growing Cactuses</ActivityItem></Lore> so we can rescue my friend.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Not with these <ActivityItem>Magic Growing Cactuses</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
They're top of the line. When they grow, they'll lift the track into place.
