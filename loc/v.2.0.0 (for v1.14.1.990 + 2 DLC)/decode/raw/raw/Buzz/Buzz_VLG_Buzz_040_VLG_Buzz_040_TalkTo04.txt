Astounding, cadet. These <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Badges</ActivityItem> look very authentic.

Now, we just need to decide who to recruit for our Star Command Academy...

TAG: Player_000_f
We need someone...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...who proves that heroism comes even in small packages.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...who's a seasoned explorer.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...with a little bite.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
That's Remy, of course.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Plus, he can cook for everyone.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Hopefully, he won't mind having to prepare air tea and air crumpets for some of us...

TAG: Buzz_018_f
Well, I'd say you're ready for your first recruitment mission, {PlayerName}. Good luck!

TAG: Buzz_019_f
Okay, who else...?

TAG: Buzz_017_f
That sounds like Moana to me. I've heard about her travels. Very impressive.

TAG: Buzz_020_f
Like Scar. He kept that old badge for so long, he's practically already a Space Ranger.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
I like your thinking, {PlayerName}.
