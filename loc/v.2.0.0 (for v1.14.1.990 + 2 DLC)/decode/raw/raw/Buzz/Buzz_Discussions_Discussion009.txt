What do you think is more important? Bravery or integrity?

Bravery!

Aren't they the same thing?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
To act boldly when necessary, regardless of fear! You're right â bravery is essential.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Though integrity is also extremely important.

Did I answer correctly...?

TAG: Buzz_011_f
It was a trick question, my friend.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
The truth is, you need both.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
To be honest and principled. To live a life worthy of a Space Ranger.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Integrity is essential.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Though you also have to be brave so you can do the right thing even when it's hard.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
I don't believe so.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Integrity is doing what's right. Bravery is acting, even when you're afraid.

Bravery!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Integrity!
