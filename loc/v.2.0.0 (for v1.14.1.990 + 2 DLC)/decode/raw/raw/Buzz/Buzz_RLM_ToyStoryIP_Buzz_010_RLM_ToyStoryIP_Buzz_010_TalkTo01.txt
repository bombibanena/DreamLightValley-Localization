Excellent surveillance work, {PlayerName}. Now we can recreate Bonnie's farm exactly how she wants it.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Er... no. Dreamlight Valley is...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...a new place for you to explore.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...a place where toys never get put in the attic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...the most amazing Village in the whole quadrant.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Let's see... Yep, Bonnie has big dreams for this little settlement.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Her drawings are quite detailed... Of course, we could add a... No, it would never work.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
What wouldn't work?

TAG: Buzz_009_f
I was just thinking, we could improve on this design. But we'd need materials we won't find here in Bonnie's room.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Some flowers... perhaps an adhesive bonding agent...

TAG: Buzz_010_f
I think I know where you could find all that. Come with me to Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Dreamlight Valley? Is that some sort of expensive playset?

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Or a themed family eatery like Pizza Planet?

TAG: Buzz_016_f
Really? Well, if you think it'll have the materials we need to help Bonnie...

TAG: Buzz_017_f
...then I suppose I ought to visit. Go on a recon mission.

TAG: Buzz_018_f
Just wait here. I'll get a special command ship set up for you in the Village. A REAL command ship.

TAG: Buzz_019_f
A REAL ship...? Like in the animated short films Bonnie watches? Will it have a hyperdrive?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It'll have... uh... a hyper-active hyperdrive.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Um... no. Sorry. I don't know what that is.

TAG: Buzz_020_f
Then I can't wait to see it.

TAG: Buzz_021_f
I understand. It... uh... it may just be part of the Star Command story.
