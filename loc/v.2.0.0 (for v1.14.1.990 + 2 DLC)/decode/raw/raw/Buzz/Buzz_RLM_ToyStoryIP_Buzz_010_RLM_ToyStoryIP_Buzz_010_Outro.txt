So this isâ *GASP*

TAG: Buzz_010_f
WHY ARE YOU ENORMOUS?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm not enormous. You're toy-sized.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Because I'm not a toy!

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Yes, because I'm aâ Wait!

TAG: Buzz_018_f
I hope so. This is... unsettling.

TAG: Buzz_020_f
For now, I'll do some surveillance and see if I can get reacquainted.

TAG: Buzz_021_f
Great! I'll go see Woody and we'll keep working on Bonnie's farm.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
If you're not a toy, I'm breaking toy rule number one! I was supposed to drop to the ground and pretend to be inanimate!

TAG: Buzz_014_f
I don't think toys need to do that here in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
The line between what's a toy and what's not a toy... and what's real and what's pretend... well, it's all a little fuzzy here.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Hmm... Well, uh... I guess I'll have to take your word for it.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
You know, it's the strangest thing... Now that I'm here... this Valley seems familiar.

TAG: Buzz_016_f
Woody and I... we've been here before, haven't we?

TAG: Buzz_019_f
This place... it was a place where no toy went unloved, and everyone had a purpose.

TAG: Buzz_017_f
Don't worry. All your memories should start to come back soon.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
You're not aâ What?!
