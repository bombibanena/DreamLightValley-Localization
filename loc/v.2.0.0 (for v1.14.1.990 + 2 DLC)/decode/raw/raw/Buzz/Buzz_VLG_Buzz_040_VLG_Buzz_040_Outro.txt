Congratulations, cadet! The welcoming ceremony was a huge success.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Our newest recruits were there, everyone had fun, and seemed to enjoy the buffet.

You know, when I came to this Village on a recon mission, I didn't know what to expect.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
But you helped me find my place, remember my past here...

TAG: Buzz_005_f
And you helped me figure out what sort of hero the Valley needs.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I learned from you when I was a kid.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you getting a bit teary-eyed, Buzz?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm awesome, I know.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Wow... That means a lot.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Working with you has made me a better Space Ranger, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Which is why I think it's high time you got a new rank.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
I'm promoting you from cadet to fully commissioned Space Ranger!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Aaaah, I'm so happy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Wow, so fast?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Finally!

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Well, you deserve it! And since you're a Space Ranger now, you'll need this... your very own <ActivityItem>Jetpack</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Well, only the most exceptional recruits get their wings so quickly, but you've proven that you are truly exceptional.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
And speaking of wings...

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Here! Your very own <ActivityItem>Jetpack</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Buzz_014_f
I know how you feel. When you're a cadet, it seems that time can't pass fast enough before you get your wings.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Well, I can't really cry. My eyes are made of durable plastic.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
That you are. Who knows. Maybe you can be an action figure too, someday.
