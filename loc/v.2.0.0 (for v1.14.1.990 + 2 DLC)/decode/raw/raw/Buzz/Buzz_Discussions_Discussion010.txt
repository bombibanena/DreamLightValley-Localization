{PlayerName}, which planet is your favorite?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm pretty fond of Earth.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Jupiter! It's big.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Neither of those...

TAG: Buzz_001_f
That's understandable. After all, it is our home.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
And it's a beautiful one.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Yes, it is an impressive planet in terms of size.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
And did you know that the red spot on its surface is a giant storm?

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Fascinating stuff.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
A different planet, then?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I like Saturn. Pretty rings.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Mars. It's red. Red is cool.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Some other planet...

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Saturn's rings are quite impressive.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Did you know they're made almost entirely of ice?

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Well, did you know that Mars has red soil because of oxidation?

TAG: Buzz_011_f
A different planet, then?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Mercury. It's so tiny!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Neptune. It's so icy!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
No... neither of those...

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Ah, yes, Mercury. It's the smallest and closest to the Sun in our solar system.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Neptune? Well, that is one of the coldest places in the solar system.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
It wouldn't make much of a vacation spot, but it is fascinating.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
We're running low on planets, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Venus. It's our closest neighbor.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Uranus. It's got so many moons.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Hm... Neither of those...

TAG: Buzz_016_f
Venus, huh? That's the hottest planet in this whole system.

TAG: Buzz_019_f
Even if we had actual space suits, I don't think either of us would last long there.

TAG: Buzz_017_f
Last time I counted, it had over twenty.

TAG: Buzz_018_f
It's always nice when something comes with a lot of accessories.

TAG: Buzz_020_f
I don't think there are any more planets in our solar system, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
I maintain that Pluto is a planet and it's my favorite.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
My favorite planet is the Sun.

TAG: Buzz_021_f
As a Space Ranger, or at least a toy one, I must remain neutral on this contentious issue.

TAG: Buzz_022_f
Well, my friend, that's a bit outside the boundaries of my question, but I can't fault your selection.

TAG: Buzz_023_f
This solar system's Sun is certainly impressive.

TAG: Buzz_024_f
A yellow dwarf, if I'm not mistaken.
