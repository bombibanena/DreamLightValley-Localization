Mirabel, do you think you could help me out with something?

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Of course, {PlayerName}! What can I do?

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Have you met the Beast yet? He's a little new to the Valley.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
I have! We've spoken a little.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
He's... not really a chatterbox, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You could say that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's... an understatement.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's what I need help with!

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
You could even go further than that!

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Not everyone finds it easy to meet new people.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
When we finally talked my TÃ­o Bruno into moving out of the walls, he was still pretty shy in crowds. Lots of people are just shy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You sure you're up to this?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I thought we weren't supposed to talk about him...

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Absolutely!

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
I'd be happy to spend some time with the Beast.

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
So what's the plan?

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
Why don't you ask him to come see me later? I have a sewing project he could help with.

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
If we do something together, that might help him feel more comfortable.

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
Perfect! I'll pass along your suggestion and see if the Beast is up to it.

TAG: Mirabel_014_f
Oh, did I tell you about that? Well, that's all in the past.

TAG: Mirabel_015_f
Phew!

TAG: Mirabel_016_f
But, hey, it's okay.
