Mirabel! Can I get your opinion on something?

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Of course! What's up, {PlayerName}?

The Beast is trying to work on his relationship with Belle.

And since you've told me there are so many great couples in the family Madrigal, I thought we could ask your opinion on what goes into keeping a romance alive!

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Wow... Um... I guess I never thought about it.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
But my parents, Julieta and AgustÃ­n, are an amazing couple!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's so cute.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Really? Your parents?

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
They really are! They've been together for ages. And it's super obvious that they love each other a ton!

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
So what's something that helps them keep the spark going?

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Well, definitely food.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
Oh! Your mother can make magical food, right?

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
That's right! She can heal people with her cooking.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
But even when people aren't hurt, her food is amazing!

Sometimes Papi will take a bite of an arepa and just melt! I think their love for each other makes the food taste even better.

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
Does that help?

TAG: Mirabel_014_f
It really does! Thanks, Mirabel!

TAG: Mirabel_015_f
Completely! I grew up seeing how much they love each other.
