I was trying to make stuffed toys that look like some of my cousin Antonio's animal friends...

So I borrowed a book of sewing patterns â <ActivityItem>Crafty Creatures</ActivityItem> â from the Library. But then I saw Remy, and he wanted me to taste the new arepas he made, which of course I had to do... and now I can't find the book!

That's just what I'm here to talk to you about!

How did you lose it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're not the only one who's lost a book around here.

Really?! Phew! That's a relief.

The last place I remember having it was in the Plaza when I was feeding the squirrels.

Well... The Valley is so amazing, and there's always something happening.

So, I must have gotten distracted.

Really? Well, the Valley IS pretty amazing.

And there's always something happening. So I guess I'm not the only one who can get distracted.
