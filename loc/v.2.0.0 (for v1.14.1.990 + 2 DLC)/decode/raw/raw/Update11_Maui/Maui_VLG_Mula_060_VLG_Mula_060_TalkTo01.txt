{PlayerName}! Am I glad to see you!

TAG: Maui_001_f
I found a Mini Flag hidden under a huge boulder. How did the Fairy Godmother LIFT that thing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You have the flag â what's the problem?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She bibbidi-bobbidi-moved it with magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe she's SUPER muscular under that robe.

TAG: Maui_003_f
The problem is... it's encased in some sort of magical ice.

TAG: Maui_007_f
I tried holding it over a fire and nothing happened.

Our clue also has some drawings on it, so maybe we need to collect the items in the pictures. I don't know how that'll help us melt the ice, though.

TAG: Maui_009_f
Give me the clue. I'll gather the items from the drawing and try and piece them together!

TAG: Maui_002_f
HA! Good one! I gotta tell you, though, this Mini Flag thing is really making me think.

TAG: Maui_006_f
You have the flag... What's the problem?

TAG: Maui_004_f
I know you're joking but I would LOVE to work out with the Fairy Godmother. She's great.

TAG: Maui_005_f
She is! But that's beside the point. Maui... if you HAVE the flag, what's the problem?
