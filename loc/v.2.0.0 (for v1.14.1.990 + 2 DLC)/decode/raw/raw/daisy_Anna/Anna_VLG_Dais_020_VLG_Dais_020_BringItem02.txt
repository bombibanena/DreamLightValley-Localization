"Dots & Daisies"... Oh! Did Minnie and Daisy finally launch their clothing line?

TAG: Anna_000_f
You know about it?

TAG: Anna_010_f
Minnie told me all about it at our last hot chocolate meet-up. I'm so glad they've started!

TAG: Anna_011_f
I'm actually wearing one of their designs right now.

TAG: Anna_002_f
I was going to ASK if that was a new outfit... It looks great on you!

TAG: Anna_003_f
I'm sure it'll look really good on you too. Mr. McDuck will probably have it in stock in no time.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Huh... If I'm not in one of my "You're the Queen" dresses for my official duties, I usually like clothes for adventuring that you don't have to worry about getting chocolate fondue on.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Try anyway! It might be fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It might be a little too modern for you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Get out of your comfort zone!

TAG: Anna_005_f
Well... I'll think about it.

TAG: Anna_006_f
No matter what, I'll be sure to spread the word! Give Minnie and Daisy my best.

TAG: Anna_013_f
"To each their own," right?

TAG: Anna_012_f
Maybe... Oh, but the thing about a comfort zone is that it's so COMFY!

TAG: Anna_007_f
I bet their designs will be amazing.

TAG: Anna_008_f
If things go well, Mr. McDuck's store will have stock in no time! You should check it out.
