Hey, Merlin!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're the Wizard, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How do I stop the Mastermind?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Yes, yes... of course. You know I'm a wizard. Why are you asking?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Vanellope sent me here on an adventure...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Vanellope didn't tell you about the game?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Vanellope, you say? Oh no, I'm afraid I don't have time for her sugary shenanigans. I'm far too busy.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Might I point you in the direction of Anna? She's been following me around for days now.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Trying to copy my voice, asking about my childhood, and all that...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
A game, you say? She most certainly did not!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Oh dear. Who... or what is the Mastermind? ... Some nefarious force poised to sweep the Valley with Dark Magic?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Um... no.
