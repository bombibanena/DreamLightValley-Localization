Hey, Remy! Rapunzel said you seemed a little down today... Everything okay?

TAG: Remy_001_f
She said that? Oh... this must be about earlier.

TAG: Remy_002_f
She was asking about my dreams. I told her I always wanted to open a restaurant, but now I've done that a couple of times. And I'm happy, but...

TAG: Remy_005_f
I've mastered all the recipes in my repertoire, and Merlin doesn't have cookbooks that don't use eye-of-newt or time travel.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Guess I'm kinda missing that cheesy, lightning-bolt roasted mushroom discovery feeling... Does that make any sense?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You need to cook something new!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You need to get inspired.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Merlin has some great cookbooks.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Exactly. But when?

TAG: Remy_009_f
I have recipes I could try, but I'm running two restaurants in the Valley now. Not a lot of time for experimenting.

TAG: Remy_011_f
What if I cooked one of the recipes for you? Maybe tasting something new will help you get your inspiration back?

TAG: Remy_012_f
Hmm... Well, you are a great cook, {PlayerName}. If anyone could help me get inspired, I know it's you! Here...

TAG: Remy_013_f
Take this recipe. I've never made it, but it's pretty interesting, has nothing to do with butter, and it's spicy. Which is always exciting.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You got it, chef!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Your dream meal is on the way!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What do you have against butter?

TAG: Remy_015_f
Thanks, pal!

TAG: Remy_017_f
I've got to get back to work. Good luck!

TAG: Remy_014_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. Go be inspiring!

TAG: Remy_016_f
Nothing! I LOVE butter! It's the backbone of French cooking. I just want to try something new.

TAG: Remy_006_f
You're right, but you can't just pick inspiration off a tree like a cosmic fig!

TAG: Remy_008_f
They seem more like potion recipes. Not really what I'm looking for.
