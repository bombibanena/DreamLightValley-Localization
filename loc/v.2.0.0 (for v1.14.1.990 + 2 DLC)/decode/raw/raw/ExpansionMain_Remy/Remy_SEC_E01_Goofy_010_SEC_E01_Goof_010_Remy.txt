You and Goofy caught a bunch of weird stuff around Eternity Isle and you need some recipes for them?

TAG: Remy_001_f
Well, looks like with the Ingredients Goofy gave you, you could already make a nice meal...

TAG: Remy_002_f
Throw a <ActivityItem>Prisma Shrimp</ActivityItem> in with the <ActivityItem>Celery, Butter, Rice, and some Spice</ActivityItem>. It'll be delicious!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Thanks, Remy! I'll try that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think I'll experiment with some other Ingredients...

TAG: Remy_003_f
No problem, pal! And whatever you make... let's add it to the menu at Chez Remy!

TAG: Remy_004_f
Hmm... I guess if you mashed up that <ActivityItem>Robot Fish</ActivityItem> with some <ActivityItem>Almonds</ActivityItem>, it would be an interesting almondine.

TAG: Remy_005_f
But careful you don't break your teeth on it.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Oh, and maybe if you threw that <ActivityItem>Dunebopper</ActivityItem> in with another fish you find in the quicksand...

TAG: Remy_007_f
...plus a vegetable, a spice, and a <ActivityItem>Sand Worm</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Remy_008_f
...well, I don't think the meal would look very pretty, but it would have crunch.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Thanks, Remy! I'll see what I can cook up.
