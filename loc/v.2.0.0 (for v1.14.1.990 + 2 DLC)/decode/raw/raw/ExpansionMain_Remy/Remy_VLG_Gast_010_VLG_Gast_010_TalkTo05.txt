How's my favorite chef doing?

TAG: Remy_003_f
Just fine. But, uh... that Gaston is pretty big and a little... intimidating, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Personality or physicality?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, the man is still ridiculously built after surviving on a diet of only coconuts for years.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Both! But it's fine. I'm sure he's totally harmless.

TAG: Remy_004_f
But hey, we've got to talk about that new meat freezer!

TAG: Remy_006_f
I'd go to a party with a dozen Gastons to get my paws on some new ingredients!

TAG: Remy_007_f
Any new recipes in mind?

TAG: Remy_008_f
Oh, so many! Pulled pork... shish taouk... maybe even some turnip tartiflette!

TAG: Remy_009_f
Well, don't let me get in the way of your inspiration!

TAG: Remy_010_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Remy_011_f
I'm gonna go mingle until Gaston unlocks the freezer for me, and then I'm off to test some recipes!
