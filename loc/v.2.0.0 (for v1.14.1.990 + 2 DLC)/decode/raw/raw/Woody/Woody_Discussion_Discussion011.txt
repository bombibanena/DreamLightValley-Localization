Hey {PlayerName} â be a pal and settle a little disagreement.

TAG: Woody_001_f
Which is harder: ridin' a horse or flyin' a spaceship?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Riding a horse.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Flying a spaceship.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They're both hard in their own ways.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Exactly. You get it!

TAG: Woody_003_f
When you're ridin' a horse, you've gotta understand the horse, guide 'em, protect 'em.

TAG: Woody_004_f
You really have to get to know your steed. They're your partner.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Hm. Relationships ARE complicated...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I guess it depends on the horse.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What about... a space-horse?

TAG: Woody_005_f
Couldn't have said it better myself.

TAG: Woody_006_f
Y'know, that's fair.

TAG: Woody_007_f
And I'll bet it all depends on the spaceship too...

TAG: Woody_008_f
Why don't we call it a draw?

TAG: Woody_009_f
A space-horse? Have they got those now?

TAG: Woody_010_f
I'll have to ask Buzz. They must be sold separately.

TAG: Woody_011_f
What?! No, no, no! Spaceships are all just buttons and blinky lights.

TAG: Woody_012_f
Okay, fine. You MAY be right. But on a spaceship, all you've gotta do is push the right buttons.
