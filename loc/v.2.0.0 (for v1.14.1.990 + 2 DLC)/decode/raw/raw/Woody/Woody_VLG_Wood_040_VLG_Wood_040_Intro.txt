{PlayerName}! {PlayerName}! I think I figured out the problem with the lights on my Carousel. Have you got time to help me out?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, of course!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not right now!

TAG: Woody_003_f
Okay, so I was searchin' around the Carousel, tryin' to figure out why the lights weren't workin'...

TAG: Woody_008_f
...when I realized I hadn't checked what was in that old toy chest yet.

I went to open it, but the second I touched it...

TAG: Woody_005_f
The lights started to flicker, and I heard music startin' up. The Carousel was powering back on.

TAG: Woody_006_f
Whatever's inside that chest is the key to powering up the Carousel again.

TAG: Woody_007_f
Whaddaya say you help me get to the bottom of this?

TAG: Woody_001_f
Let's take another look at the toy chest.

TAG: Woody_004_f
Come back as soon as you can. I can't wait to get the Carousel lit up!
