All right, {PlayerName}; if we're gonna rebuild Bonnie's farm just how she left it...

TAG: Woody_001_f
...we need to start by building a corral where all the cattle can live.

TAG: Woody_005_f
There's lots of supplies we can use scattered around the room.

TAG: Woody_025_f
But I don't think we're gonna find everything we need here.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Don't worry. I sent Buzz on a recon mission. He's going to help us find everything.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Smart thinking! You sure are making yourself useful.

TAG: Woody_006_f
Keep this up and I bet you'll be one of Bonnie's favorite toys in no time.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm not a toy. But thanks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I mean, obviously she'd love me. I'm so lifelike.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But I don't have a cool pull string or voice box...

TAG: Woody_007_f
Oh no. Not another toy in denial. Okay, listen... You areâ

TAG: Woody_010_f
Uh... forget it. Just tell me what I'll need to fix Bonnie's farm.

TAG: Woody_014_f
Well, you can start by gathering up some of the <ActivityItem>Pipe Cleaners</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Ice Pop Sticks</ActivityItem> scattered around the room.

TAG: Woody_024_f
Great. I'll go gather those.

TAG: Woody_015_f
Oh, and watch out. They seem to be stuck to some candy. And there's a lot of paper on the floor, too.

TAG: Woody_016_f
Don't worry. My trusty Pickaxe and Shovel should take care of all that.

TAG: Woody_019_f
Great! Once you've got everything, <Lore>bring it back to me</Lore>. In the meantime, I'll start trying to figure out how to put it all together...

TAG: Woody_008_f
And you've got all those cool accessories. I bet they're sold separately, huh?

TAG: Woody_004_f
Yep. Courtesy of Mr. McDuck...

TAG: Woody_011_f
Mr. Mc-who?

TAG: Woody_009_f
Hey, toys don't need a lot of snazzy features to make a kid happy. Trust me.

TAG: Woody_012_f
You just have to try to do what's best for 'em â always.

TAG: Woody_013_f
Speaking of which... What will I need to fix Bonnie's farm?
