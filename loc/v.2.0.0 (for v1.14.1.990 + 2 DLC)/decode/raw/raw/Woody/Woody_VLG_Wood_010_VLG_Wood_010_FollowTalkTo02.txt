Looks like you saved the day, partner. Who knew fishing and harvesting crops could be so dangerous?

TAG: Woody_004_f
*sigh* I don't know what to do now. I really wanna help out, but the Valley's a lot bigger and more complicated than a kid's room.

Failure is an opportunity to learn.

No one can be great at everything.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I get overwhelmed sometimes too, you know.

TAG: Woody_001_f
I know, I know. You're right, {PlayerName}. I just gotta pull up my bootstraps and figure out what's next.

TAG: Woody_000_f
There's a bunch of piles of junk inside. I tried to clear 'em out myself, but they're too big for me.

TAG: Woody_007_f
I'll help you clean up the Carousel. Maybe we can figure out what's so special about it. Let's get started.

TAG: Woody_013_f
Say, instead of you trying to help everyone else, why don't I help you?

TAG: Woody_008_f
Is there anything you need?

TAG: Woody_009_f
Well... now that you mention it, yeah. There's my Carousel Mr. McDuck dragged outta storage for me.

TAG: Woody_010_f
I've been wonderin' about it. I know it's got the horses and the whole Western motif, but it seems like kind of a funny place for me to live, doesn't it?

TAG: Woody_011_f
I thought I would've been more comfortable in a nice ranch playset, or a sheriff's office made outta cardboard.

TAG: Woody_012_f
Mr. McDuck said there's something special about it. Something magical.

TAG: Woody_014_f
Huh... Well, if there's something special about it, I can't remember what. And it sure has seen better days.

TAG: Woody_016_f
Take a look...

TAG: Woody_002_f
I know. It's just... I'm so good at helping my fellow toys and makin' kids happy, I wish I were better at all this.

TAG: Woody_005_f
Thanks. It's nice to know I'm not alone.
