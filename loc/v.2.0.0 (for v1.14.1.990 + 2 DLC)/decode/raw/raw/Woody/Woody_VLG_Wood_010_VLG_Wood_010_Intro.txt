Say, {PlayerName}, any chance you can help me? I've been tryin' to be a good neighbor to the folks around here, but I've hit a bit of a bump in the road.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course. What's wrong?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Some other time...

TAG: Woody_005_f
Well, you know me, always tryin' to do what's right...

TAG: Player_005_f
Let's go see Remy first...

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
I'm sure it's not all that bad.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
I need to assess the situation.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
I need to see this train wreck for myself.

TAG: Woody_008_f
And that's what I was doin'. Just helpin' my neighbors out...

TAG: Woody_002_f
But it all went sideways pretty fast. First I tried to help Remy, and that didn't go too well. But then I went to help Goofy...

TAG: Woody_003_f
And well, that was a downright disaster.

TAG: Woody_004_f
Okay, one thing at a time. What happened with Remy?

TAG: Woody_023_f
Right. Well, Remy told me he could use some help in the kitchen.

TAG: Woody_024_f
So I just dove right in! I figured, how hard can it be?

TAG: Woody_025_f
Heh-heh. Let's just say it was... not good. Now Remy's got a back order of meals he needs to fill.

TAG: Woody_026_f
And everybody says that when it comes to cooking, you're the best around. I don't suppose you could lend a hand?

TAG: Woody_027_f
Always looking on the bright side, huh?

TAG: Woody_030_f
But you're right. Let's head over to Remy's.

TAG: Woody_028_f
That's smart. Let's head over to Remy's.

TAG: Woody_029_f
I'm glad one of us is having fun...

TAG: Woody_006_f
That's great! Whenever you can.
