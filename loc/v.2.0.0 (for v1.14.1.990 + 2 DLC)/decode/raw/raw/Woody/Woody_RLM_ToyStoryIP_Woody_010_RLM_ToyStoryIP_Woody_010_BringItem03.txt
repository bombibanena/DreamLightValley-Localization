Nicely done, {PlayerName}! I'll put these on Bonnie's farm.

TAG: Woody_001_f
Hey-howdy-hey! The farm looks even better than it did when Bonnie left. She's gonna be one happy kid.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Say, I can't thank you enough for this, partner. You really know what being a toy's all about.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Woody, you spend so much time trying to make other people happy...

TAG: Woody_004_f
...why don't you take a little vacation for yourself and come to my Village? Buzz is already waiting for you there.

TAG: Woody_005_f
Your Village? Where's that?

TAG: Player_000_f
It's a place called Dreamlight Valley, where...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...nobody ever has to grow up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...toys never get lost.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...there's always a touch of magic in the air.

TAG: Woody_006_f
Wow... that sounds pretty incredible.

TAG: Woody_008_f
And since Bonnie and her family aren't back from their trip yet...

TAG: Woody_009_f
...I suppose I could go visit. Not much for me to do around here till they get back.

TAG: Woody_010_f
Great! I'll <Lore>get a place set up for you in the Village</Lore>.
