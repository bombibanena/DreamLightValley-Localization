Y'know, I've been a toy for a long time, {PlayerName}.

And I like to think I've learned a thing or two about it. Go ahead: Ask me anything about being a toy.

What are the best games?

How do you avoid people seeing you move?

How do you find the right kid?

TAG: Woody_004_f
Tricky question. The answer is: Whatever games your kid likes best. Some toys are built for specific games. Checkers. Teatime.

TAG: Woody_005_f
But if you're a teatime doll and your kid likes superheroes? You've gotta be flexible. Find yourself a cape.

Whenever you see someone, you freeze. That's instinct. Even when Buzz thought he was a Space Ranger, he still froze around humans.

But it's also important to freeze in the right spot. Where your kid last left you is best. But if you can't get there, get somewhere you can easily be found.

TAG: Woody_008_f
A lot of toys think there's only one right kid for them. I used to think like that, too. But not anymore.

TAG: Woody_009_f
You take care of the kid you're with. That's what it means to be a toy.
