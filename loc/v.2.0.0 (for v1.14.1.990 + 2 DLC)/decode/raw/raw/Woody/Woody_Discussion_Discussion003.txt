Every now and then, Buzz and I like to have a little debate. How 'bout givin' your opinion... Which toys are the most fun: cowboys or Space Rangers?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Cowboys.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Space Rangers.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Both are good.

TAG: Woody_001_f
Yes! That's what I always say! Now, tell me, which cowboy game's your favorite?

TAG: Woody_013_f
Dinosaur Rodeo? Rescue the Sheep? Or Old West Town?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Dinosaur Rodeo.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Rescue the Sheep.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Old West Town.

TAG: Woody_004_f
Nothin' like a good game of Dinosaur Rodeo. As long as Rex is up for it, of course.

TAG: Woody_005_f
I saved many a sheep from danger in my day. You would not believe the trouble they got into.

TAG: Woody_007_f
Kidnapped by bandits. Tied to racetracks. Almost eaten by dinosaurs.

TAG: Woody_008_f
And of course, the best part of savin' sheep is it makes Bo Peep happy.

TAG: Woody_006_f
There's nothing like a relaxing game of Old West Town after a long day.

TAG: Woody_014_f
You have to set up the cardboard box-buildings, sure, but that's half the fun.

TAG: Woody_009_f
And then the sheriff goes around to every building and makes sure everything's okay.

TAG: Woody_010_f
And if that's not interesting enough, the bank usually gets robbed. Can't argue with the classics.

TAG: Woody_002_f
What?! Seriously?! Who prefers Space Rangers? They're just...

TAG: Woody_011_f
No. No. I'm past this. I'm not gonna get jealous. It's just... It's fine.

TAG: Woody_012_f
I can accept that you prefer Space Rangers. Every kid has their favorite.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Well, obviously cowboys are good, and I guess Space Rangers are fine, but one of them has to be at least a little more fun. C'mon.
