Y'know, kids are amazing. It's great to get to watch 'em grow up.

TAG: Woody_001_f
What were you like as a kid?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A good kid.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A brat.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I loved my toys.

TAG: Woody_002_f
I bet you were. Course I think all kids are pretty good. Oh, except maybe Sid. (Wonder what ever happened to him...) Anyway...

TAG: Woody_005_f
There comes a time in every toy's life when their kid just doesn't need 'em anymore.

TAG: Woody_006_f
And that's okay. It means the kid's growin' up. But how do you deal with it when they're ready to move on?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You should move on too.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Let yourself mourn.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Feel your feelings.

TAG: Woody_007_f
Move on. Find the next kid. Keep being a toy.

TAG: Woody_010_f
Yeah. That's what we're made for... You're right. It's important to keep goin'. Thanks.

TAG: Woody_008_f
Yeah, I guess I need to give myself time. I mean, I want to be there for my friends.

TAG: Woody_011_f
But when a kid outgrows you... it's a big deal, ya know?

TAG: Woody_009_f
I suppose you're right. Sit with the feelings until you can accept things and eventually move on. Thanks, pal.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Oh, I don't know about that. Kids can be cranky or mischievous, but I think most kids are pretty good.

TAG: Woody_004_f
And I'm sure they loved you, too.
