TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sorry, I don't have time now.

TAG: Scrooge_025_f
{PlayerName}, I have another cupcake order for you!

TAG: Scrooge_026_f
Could I trouble you for more <ActivityItem>Stitch Cupcakes</ActivityItem>? I want to share them with our grand community.

TAG: Scrooge_027_f
Please <ActivityItem>bake the cupcakes</ActivityItem> and distribute these out in the Village?

TAG: Scrooge_021_f
{PlayerName}, I've a favor to ask.

TAG: Scrooge_022_f
I'd like a few more orders of <ActivityItem>Stitch Cupcakes</ActivityItem>, if you've the time.

TAG: Scrooge_023_f
Would ya mind distributing these to some Villagers?

TAG: Scrooge_024_f
And dinnae dally! There's Dreamlight Parks Fest joy to be spread!

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
Have ya got time for some Dreamlight Parks Fest baking today, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
I'd like some of those scrumptious <ActivityItem>Stitch Cupcakes</ActivityItem> you're so good at makin'.

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
After all, everyone deserves a sweet treat â especially during the Dreamlight Parks Fest!

TAG: Scrooge_019_f
Not to mention it'll ruffle my nephew Donald somethin' fierce. That wee Stitch really gets to him! Hee-hee!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Do me a favor and hand 'em out to some Villagers.

TAG: Scrooge_020_f
It'll also ruffle my nephew Donald somethin' fierce. Back in the day, wee Stitch and Donald had a grand rivalry!

TAG: Scrooge_032_f
{PlayerName}, just who I was hoping to see!

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
I'd like to put in a special order with ya for more <ActivityItem>Stitch Cupcakes</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
It just isn't a proper festival day without 'em.

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
Bake 'em and bring 'em to some Villagers, quick as ya can.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
It's about my nephew, Donald.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
I've heard that he's been in a bit of a prank war with Stitch all over the Village.

TAG: Scrooge_030_f
Well, I'd like to do my part to make things right with the Villagers â using cupcakes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Great idea. Everyone loves cupcakes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
... You've already lost me.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Aye, and here's my grand idea...

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
... I'd like 'em to be <ActivityItem>Stitch Cupcakes</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I've told Donald I'd help him by handing out cupcakes as peace offerin's for the trouble the pranks have caused. To protect our family's reputation, and all.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
But when the Villagers see these, they'll think the cupcakes are from Stitch, NOT Donald!

TAG: Scrooge_033_f
Oh, he's gonna boil like a red-hot kettle! And it serves my nephew right for not considering the consequences of his actions.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Could ya bake up some of those <ActivityItem>Stitch Cupcakes</ActivityItem> and hand 'em out to some Villagers? Let's have a little fun. Heh-heh.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
I told Donald I'd send out some treats for the festival on behalf of our family.

TAG: Scrooge_031_f
But when he sees that they look like his old nemesis, he'll boil like a red-hot kettle! And it serves my nephew right for all the trouble he's caused.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Dinnae worry; I'll explain.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Back in the day, he used to get into some fine squabbles with a wee fluffy blue fella named Stitch.

TAG: Scrooge_029_f
I was hopin' that you could make some <Lore>cupcakes</Lore> that resemble Stitch.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Well, come back when you do!
