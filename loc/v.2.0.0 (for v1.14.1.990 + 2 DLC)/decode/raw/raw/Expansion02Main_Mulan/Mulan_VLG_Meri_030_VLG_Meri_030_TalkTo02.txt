Say, Mulan... you're a fierce warrior who's good with a bo staff, aren't you?

TAG: Mulan_002_f
I'd like to think so.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
Before the Forgetting... were you friends with Merida?

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Merida...

TAG: Mulan_005_f
Of course! Merida! I remember now... We always had a wonderful time together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That makes sense. You two are so alike.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm surprised you weren't competitive with each other!

TAG: Mulan_006_f
Merida told me a story once, about shooting for her own hand and deciding her own fate.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
I knew then that we'd be great friends.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
You and Merida should catch up later. But right now, I'm on the trail of something important.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
Hades is after some sort of artifact. It sounds like Merida asked you to help her hide it. Do you remember anything like that?

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Oh... now that you mention it, that DOES sound familiar.

TAG: Mulan_012_f
Merida asked me to hide a clue somewhere even she wouldn't find it. I remember I climbed up a <Lore>statue of a giant flying horse</Lore>. I hope that helps.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
Oh, we were a little at first. Luckily, though, Merida knew that I was the most skilled with a bo staff, and she was the most skilled at archery.
