Ah, {PlayerName}, there you are. If you still insist on restoring Mirabel, Mother Gothel, and Kristoff's singing voices, I'm finally feeling rested enough.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
But I'll need my favorite assistant's help. Well, what do you say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I'll help you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe later.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
What happened to their voices? How do we restore them?

TAG: Ursula_022_f
Well, first, you'll have to catch them.

TAG: Ursula_000_f
Catch them...?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Exactly! <Lore>I turned them into squid</Lore>.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Why squid?!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Got it. Catch the squid.

TAG: Ursula_025_f
Oh, everyone knows squid are excellent backup performers. They're small enough to never steal the spotlight.

TAG: Ursula_026_f
Now, you'll find these squid swimming around the waters of the Village.

TAG: Ursula_021_f
I suggest you look <Lore>in the Glade of Trust, the Forest of Valor, and the Meadow</Lore>.

TAG: Ursula_027_f
Once you've fished them up, you'll still need a special Ingredient from each of our poor, tuneless souls...

TAG: Ursula_028_f
...a magic spark of creativity. <ActivityItem>Create a piece of a song</ActivityItem> with each of them.

TAG: Ursula_029_f
Begin with a line from them and then a line from you. And don't forget to rhyme!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I can't wait to write some songs with the other Villagers.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How will it work?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Urgh... Rhyming. I hate writing poetry.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
See, in the end, it's good that I stole their voices. I've had my fun and now you're having yours!

TAG: Ursula_019_f
Run along, {PlayerName}. The <ActivityItem>Voice Squid</ActivityItem> won't catch themselves.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
Your Dreamlight Magic is everywhere in the Valley.

TAG: Ursula_020_f
If you add words to this enchantment, it will strengthen it.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
Oh, boo-hoo. We all have to do things we don't like now and then.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Really? This was your idea. But I'm sure your friends will understand why you haven't got the time.
