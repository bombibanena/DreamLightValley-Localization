Of course I can!

TAG: Ursula_001_f
In fact, my singing voice is far superior!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why'd you steal Ariel's then?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Really? What makes yours special?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm not sure I'd agree...

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Oh, no need to rehash all that...

TAG: Ursula_003_f
What about you, dearie? Do you sing?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
All the time!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Once in a while.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Never â I'm really not a singer.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Good for you.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
You'd make a marvelous backup singer for me.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Oh, there's no need to feel insecure.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement later. I'm very good with voices, you know.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
What a shame...

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Where do I start?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Ariel's soprano is... well, it's just that â a soprano.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Whereas my own alto is warm, luscious, and full of... body.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Well, there's no accounting for taste.
