Well, hello, angelfish! I must say, the view from up here is... not a smidge better.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ursula?! Is that you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This better not be part of an evil scheme...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
You seem different... can't put my finger on why...

TAG: Ursula_010_f
That's right, dearie! Don't look so surprised.

TAG: Ursula_028_f
Wait a second... Ariel told me you made yourself look like this before to trick Prince Ericâ

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Ugh, and what a waste of time that was.

TAG: Ursula_025_f
But now, I'm simply dying to explore the surface of this little Village. I'd have chosen some other form... something closer to my natural beauty...

TAG: Ursula_027_f
But this was the only potion I had lying around. Good ingredients are almost as hard to find around here as good conversation.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I can't wait to show you around!!! We're gonna be Village besties!!!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Well... as long as you don't cause any trouble... I'll leave you be.

TAG: Ursula_031_f
Not so fast, {PlayerName}. I'm not quite ready to go for a tour just yet.

TAG: Ursula_033_f
What do you mean...?

TAG: Ursula_029_f
There's something about the Dreamlight Magic in the air. It's wreaking havoc with my enchantment.

TAG: Ursula_030_f
If I'm to maintain this form, I'll need your help.

TAG: Ursula_034_f
That is... a bit of your magic to seal the spell.

TAG: Ursula_024_f
Be a dear and bring me some <ActivityItem>Purple Rising Penstemons</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Purple Falling Penstemons</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Raspberries</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Onyx</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Ursula_035_f
Okay... but I hope I don't regret this.

TAG: Ursula_032_f
Ha! But not to worry, {PlayerName}. Right now I couldn't cause trouble if I wanted to.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Oh, please. Can't a woman take a simple walk without everyone assuming it's part of some scheme?

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Sorry... it's just... Ariel told me you made yourself look like this before to trick Prince Ericâ

TAG: Ursula_012_f
How droll, {PlayerName}. We both know what's different.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Oh! Yeah! Ariel told me you made yourself look like this before to trick Prince Ericâ
