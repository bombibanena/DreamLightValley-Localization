Ah, angelfish, do you have time to help your poor, dear friend Ursula?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Of course. What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry. Busy.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
I'd like you to put your little assistant cap back on. Metaphorically, that is. This time it's Moana who's late paying what's due. I need you to go and see her... discreetly.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Discretion is my middle name.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What did she promise you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Sounds like someone is embarrassed to ask. I could alwaysâ

TAG: Ursula_006_f
And that is why you're my favorite neighbor.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Just between the two of us...

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Moana promised me advice...

TAG: Ursula_009_f
...on how to care for my hair on the surface.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Whenever I spend time out of the sea, my fabulous hair becomes unruly and horridly dry.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Bad hair day... I have them too.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
May I suggest a comb?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Never had a bad hair day in my life.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Then you know why I'm so eager to learn our little wayfinder's secret. Her hair is always infuriatingly lush.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
I'll go talk to Moana for you.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
You think I didn't try that?! Hair is a part of you. It needs proper nourishment.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Ugh... Be careful; you're starting to sound like a little mer-princess I know.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Advice...

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Stop right there, dearie. If you're about to try your hand at blackmail, remember: It's an art.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
One that takes years to perfect. But since you've been courageous enough to try... Moana promised me advice.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Fine then... Run along. But you'll know who to blame if I'm a shell of myself when you return.
