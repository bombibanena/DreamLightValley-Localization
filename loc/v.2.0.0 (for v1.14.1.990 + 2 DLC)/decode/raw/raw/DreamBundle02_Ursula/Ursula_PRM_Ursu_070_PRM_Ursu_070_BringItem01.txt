Well done, {PlayerName}! You have my <ActivityItem>Ice Shards</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Snow</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Ursula_002_f
They'll be perfect for my little project.

TAG: Player_000_f
A project...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can I be a part of it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you have in mind?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is this another scheme?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Not yet, angelfish.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Despite what everyone seems to think of me, there's more to my days than making deals and creating potions.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Now that I can walk around like this, I'm craving something refreshing for the hot days on the beach. Something with fruit and ice.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Like a sorbet?

TAG: Ursula_000_f
A sorbet...?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
It's exactly what you're describing. Ice and fruit...

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Perfect! And now I'm only missing the fruit.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Be a dear and bring me some <ActivityItem>Red Fruit</ActivityItem> while I whip up the rest of this.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Don't worry, angelfish.
