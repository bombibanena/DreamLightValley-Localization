Hey Ursula, do you have a moment to talk potions?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
With you, angelfish? Of course!

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Now, is this a general question about potions, or are you finally coming to me as a customer?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
The former. I'm helping Jafar with some alchemy, and we're running into trouble.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Formulas he's used back in Agrabah don't seem to work here. Think you could give us some advice?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Well, normally I don't give information away for free...

TAG: Ursula_008_f
But I love the idea of Jafar owing me a favor.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Can you tell me anything about the Essences here?

TAG: Ursula_029_f
Certainly! First, do you understand the distinction between Major and Minor Essences?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Uhh, I could use a refresher.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure do!

TAG: Ursula_030_f
Oh, it's simple really: A Major Essence is comprised of three Minor Essences mixed together.

TAG: Ursula_023_f
Find one of those, and it should be easy enough to refine it into the <ActivityItem>Minor Essence of Patience</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Thanks Ursula, I'll go try to find one now!

TAG: Ursula_031_f
But which three to mix? That's the tricky part...

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Recently, I've been working on one particular Essence â the <ActivityItem>Major Essence of Will</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Oh, do you have any that we can use?

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Afraid not, dearie. I've managed to extract one of the Minor Essences that make it up, but that's as far as I've gotten.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Can you tell me how I might find or make some?

TAG: Ursula_017_f
You'll have to extract it from something that embodies willpower and self-sufficiency.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
The last time I made some, I found a stone at the bottom of some quicksand in <Lore>the Glittering Dunes</Lore>.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
It was so perfectly smooth, it must have been tumbling away, polishing itself for centuries!

TAG: Ursula_024_f
Wait, {PlayerName}... Has anyone told you about the <ActivityItem>Emotive Essences</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Ursula_025_f
Oh, no â what are those?

TAG: Ursula_026_f
Very rare and special Essences. They can't be refined from any item or resource. You must perform actions to call them forth from Dreamlight itself.

TAG: Ursula_022_f
I know of the <ActivityItem>Essence of Benevolence</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Essence of Wisdom</ActivityItem>, but I suspect there could be more waiting to be found.

TAG: Ursula_027_f
Oh, cool â thanks for the info!

TAG: Ursula_021_f
Ta-ta, dearie! Don't forget to tell Jafar about the favor he owes me.

TAG: Ursula_028_f
And here, take this little note, in case what I told you slips your mind!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Tell me... What's the problem?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
We were trying to turn Iron into Gold, but the yield was rather disappointing. Turns out alchemy works differently here compared to Jafar's Realm.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Ah yes, {PlayerName}, I see the problem. Alchemy is all about Essences here!

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Think of them as magical embodiments of the different emotions that make up our Valley.
