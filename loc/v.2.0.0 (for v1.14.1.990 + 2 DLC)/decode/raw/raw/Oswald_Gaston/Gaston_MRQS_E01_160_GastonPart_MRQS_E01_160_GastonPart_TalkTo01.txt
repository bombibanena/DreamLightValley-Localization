Ah, {PlayerName}. Has the heat of the Dunes overwhelmed you? Have you come to shelter in the shade of my enormous biceps?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Actually, I COULD use those biceps of yours for something!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Um... no.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Oh, do you need me to lift something? Or perhaps wrestle some sort of dangerous creature?

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Not exactly, but close.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I need you to pose on something and be as heavy as you possibly can to trip a trap door.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Here. Check out this picture. You see, I'm trying to open this trap door in these Ancient Ruins so I canâ

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Stop! No need for more. You require someone to pose heroically, and I'm a hero who's excellent at posing!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
There's only one problem. Without a proper breakfast, I won't be at my burliest.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Got it. One hero-sized breakfast coming up!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
*sigh* Is this your way of getting me to make you breakfast?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Ah, a very LeFou-like response, {PlayerName}. I approve.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Of course, for a thoroughly filling breakfast, you must do more than bake a few croissants.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I found an interesting recipe in the Dunes. It seems the ancient civilization that lived here had quite an impressive recipe.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
An <ActivityItem>omelet made of pure gold</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Sounds delicious.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sounds hard to make.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Sounds like a recipe for indigestion.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Yes, and I might even give you a small bite.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Wow... thanks...

TAG: Gaston_016_f
The recipe requires <ActivityItem>Golden Ingredients</ActivityItem>, but I haven't seen any of them around the Isle.

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Hmm... But since they WERE gold, perhaps the Mirage Wizard gathered them up in that vault of his?

TAG: Gaston_025_f
Right! I'll check the Cave of Wonders.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Almost impossible! Lucky for me, you'll be handling that part.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
There's no gut like Gaston's. Mine will make quick work of it!

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Eww.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Well, you ARE asking me to help you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Heroism is hard work. You can't expect me to do it on an empty stomach.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
... Oh. Well, what DOES bring you to see me?
