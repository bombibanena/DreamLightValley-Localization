So tell me â what are some foods that make you cheerful?

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Well, <ActivityItem>Shish Taouk</ActivityItem> was a common meal back in Agrabah.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
<ActivityItem>Falafel</ActivityItem> was also a frequent dish I would enjoy.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
And I would indulge in a taste of <ActivityItem>Makrout</ActivityItem> on special occasions.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
Should you be unfamiliar with these, here are the recipes.

Ah, is it time for my "community service," as you say?

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Surely you expect actions from me, and not... emotions?

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Well yeah, but hopefully the actions lead to emotions.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
I see. I shall do my best to embrace the process. What actions will this service entail?

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Well, first we're going to be taking some advice from Remy and cooking up some food.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
That sounds... tolerable. What food?

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Well, what foods do you like? What are some foods that make you feel happy?

TAG: Jafar_013_f
I'm good with making basically anything for you, as long as it will help connect you to a happier side of yourself.
