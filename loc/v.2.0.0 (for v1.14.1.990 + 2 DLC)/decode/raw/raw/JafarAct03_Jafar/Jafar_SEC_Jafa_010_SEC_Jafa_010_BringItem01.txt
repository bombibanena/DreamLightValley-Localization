Here you go Jafar: Eat up!

TAG: Jafar_005_f
{PlayerName}... I must confess â this is excellent.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Had my plans of domination been successful, I should think I would have kept you on as royal chef.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Not Remy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not the self-reflection I'm looking for, but it's a start.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Thank you... I think?

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Were he to bring me food like this, I would have been able to form a comparison.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Does the food spark any good memories?

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Hmm, well it does bring to mind the markets of Agrabah â always full of marvelous foods brought from near and far.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
And how did that make you feel?

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Inspired! It was my first glimpse at how wide the world was, how much was out there for me to learn, to use, to master.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Okay, that's a start.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Any memories with some past friends?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Any more positive memories?

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Ahh, I grow nostalgic now for my youth, plundering libraries for secret knowledge.

TAG: Jafar_028_f
You know their favorite foods already? Nice, we're halfway there!

TAG: Jafar_029_f
Now let's hang out and feed some adorable animals!

TAG: Jafar_030_f
Your enthusiasm for these empty-headed creatures is rather cloying, you know.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
All right, why don't we move on...

TAG: Jafar_021_f
How do you feel about the animals around here?

TAG: Jafar_022_f
They are a distraction, at best.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
Okay, let's work on that. Next step in your community service is going to be feeding the animals with me.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
If that is what is required for me to stay... very well.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
All right, well each animal has their own favorite type of food.

TAG: Jafar_026_f
Of that I am quite aware. It required only trivial experimentation to discover which foods would occupy them enough to leave me alone.

TAG: Jafar_027_f
Please, avail yourself of my stock.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
I have always maintained a solitary existence. I frequently find others disappointing.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
I do not follow. Did I not just describe a positive memory?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
You wish me to reflect further?

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Yes, that's kinda the point of this exercise. Any good memories that the food stirs up?

TAG: Jafar_009_f
That was not a false compliment â you are welcome.
