{PlayerName}. Do you have a moment to assist me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not now, I'm afraid.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Excellent! I have made a marvelous new discovery.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great! What did you discover?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Should I be worried?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Is... is it contagious?

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Further secrets of alchemy.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Oh, that's actually kinda nice of you. How can I help?

TAG: Jafar_018_f
I have crafted four <ActivityItem>Imagination Generators</ActivityItem>, but I require assistance setting them up around <Lore>Eternity Isle</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
Cool, where do you need 'em?

TAG: Jafar_021_f
Place them in <Lore>the Lagoon</Lore>, <Lore>the Borderlands</Lore>, <Lore>the Docks</Lore>, and one <Lore>in front of Oswald's House</Lore>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Oswald's House?

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
Cool, on it.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Oh cool! What in particular?

TAG: Jafar_010_f
I have uncovered a way to share the secret of imagination with everyone on Eternity Isle!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
But the Spark of Imagination is already there for everyone to access...

TAG: Jafar_027_f
Well yes, if one wants to exert onerous energies reaching it.

TAG: Jafar_028_f
The genius of my machines will allow everyone to access it with ease. Ideas and innovations will spring forth easily.

TAG: Jafar_029_f
Wow, you're pretty sure of yourself here, aren't you?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
I find false humility rather nauseating, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
I know that I am still not trusted, but hopefully this endeavor will influence some minds in my favor.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Indeed. The poor fellow seemed rather upset that his experimentation impaired the geometry of the Island.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Hopefully, this will raise his spirits.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Great, I'll get on that now.

TAG: Jafar_030_f
Excellent. Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
The poor fellow seemed rather upset that his experimentation impaired the geometry of the Island.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Now, now, {PlayerName}. Since my release, have I given you cause to doubt me?

TAG: Jafar_016_f
No, I guess not... recently.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
So what did you discover?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
It can be, if others are intellectually primed to share in the discovery.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
However, I am not convinced that is possible here.
