{PlayerName}, what do you know of magic?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Mostly what Merlin tells me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've worked a lot with Dreamlight.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I know there's Light Magic and there's Dark Magic.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Then you have a limited education.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Merlin's moralizing keeps him from exploring the most interesting branches of magic.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Magic is a tool. No more moral than a sword or hammer.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I agree!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm not so sure about that...

TAG: Jafar_004_f
You do? Marvelous.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
It just means that the magic user needs to be sure of the goodness in their own heart!

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Oh. How disappointing.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
I've seen magic here that only brings light and happiness.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
So I have seen. That is a potent form of sorcery.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
While I have no magic myself, I have worked with a number of magical ephemera â not just the lamp.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
I remember something about a Mystic Blue Diamond?

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Precisely!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Light? Dark? Such useless distinctions.
