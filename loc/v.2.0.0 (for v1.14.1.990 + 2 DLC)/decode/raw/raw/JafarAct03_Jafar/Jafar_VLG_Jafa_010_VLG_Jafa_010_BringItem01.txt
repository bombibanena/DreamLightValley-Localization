Okay, Jafar; here are your things.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Excellent. We may now proceed.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
What's next?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
We must construct a supremely important tool.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
And by "we," I of course mean that you will perform the labor while I continue to glean the secrets of this twisted phenomenon.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Classy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, I'm used to it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Laugh it up, lamp-liver.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
I would be loath to act in any other fashion. Now then...

TAG: Jafar_009_f
To continue with this experiment, I require a <ActivityItem>Dimensional Prism</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
You can craft it easily enough should you be sufficiently competent as to acquire a <ActivityItem>Jade</ActivityItem>, a <ActivityItem>Spinel</ActivityItem>, an <ActivityItem>Alexandrite</ActivityItem>, a <ActivityItem>Bumblestone</ActivityItem>, and an <ActivityItem>Evergem</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Tall order!

TAG: Jafar_014_f
To conduct worthwhile experiments, one must use the highest-quality resources.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Once you have acquired them, meet me in my <Lore>Palace Laboratory</Lore> so we may continue to plumb this mystery.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
All right, meet you there!

TAG: Jafar_008_f
One would then imagine that I would be the more suitable ruler, and you an assistant. Nevertheless...

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Oh, be assured, I am. Now then...
