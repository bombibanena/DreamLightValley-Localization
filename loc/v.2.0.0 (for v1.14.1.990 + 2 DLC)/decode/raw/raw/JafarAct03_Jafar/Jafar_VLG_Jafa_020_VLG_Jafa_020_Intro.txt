Jafar? You wanted to see me?

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Indeed! An exciting development has occurred that I wish to share with you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, can't right now.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Are you familiar with alchemy?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Uhh, not really.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
A little! Haven't dabbled too much in it though.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
It is the art of transmutation, wherein a base metal is refined.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
I have been expanding my research, and I believe that I have uncovered an alchemical secret.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
How exciting! What is it?

TAG: Jafar_009_f
If I am correct... I will be able to craft the famed Gilded Stone!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
The what?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Wow Jafar... that's actually quite impressive.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
The Gilded Stone â an alchemical tool that allows one to turn base metals into gold.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Wow, that would save me a lot of pumpkin farming.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Of course YOU would have such pedestrian aims.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Wow, rude.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Salt of the earth, I am.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
If you wish to aid me in this, we will require <ActivityItem>Iron Dust</ActivityItem>. Should we succeed, it will enrich not only yourself, but the entire Valley.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
The ore is easy enough to find, but I require greater tools to reduce it to the dust necessary for my first alchemical experiment â transforming that dust into gold. Understanding the process will give us more information about how to craft the stone.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Hmm, lemme touch base with EVE.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Maybe her laser could reduce the ore down to a dust like you need.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
The flying automaton has such abilities? Fascinating...

TAG: Jafar_019_f
All right, I'll be back soon enough with some <ActivityItem>Iron Dust</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
It is, is it not?

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Good. Then I shall not need to educate you on the topic.
