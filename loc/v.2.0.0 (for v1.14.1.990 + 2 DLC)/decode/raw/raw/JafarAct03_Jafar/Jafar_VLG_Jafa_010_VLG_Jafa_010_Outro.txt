All right Jafar, your fix worked!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
If I cannot rule here, then perhaps my intellectual skills may be put to use as an advisor.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll have to get back to you on that.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
I decorated with the repaired objects and everything seems just fine!

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Excellent. I am most gratified.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
And I suppose now you will attempt to return me to the lamp?

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Well... I'd feel a little bad about that.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Not saying I suddenly trust you now...

TAG: Jafar_009_f
...but I think you've earned a second chance.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
How merciful of you.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
I will endeavor to prove myself further in the future.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Anyway, you can stay in the Palace for now, unless you'd like something more cozy?

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Cozy? No, thank you; I appreciate the grandeur and austerity of living alone in my Palace.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
All right, to each their own! I'll be in touch â bye, Jafar.
