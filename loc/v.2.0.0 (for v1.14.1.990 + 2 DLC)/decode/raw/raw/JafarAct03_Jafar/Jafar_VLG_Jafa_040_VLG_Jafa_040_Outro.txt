I have endured this ridiculous trial long enough. Make your judgment.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Hold up, Jafar; there have been some developments.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
I have new evidence to go over with you.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
I see. And what evidence is this?

TAG: Jafar_006_f
I found a number of Memories that shed some light on what you were like before the Forgetting.

TAG: Player_000_f
Let's see; which to examine...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Memory about Stitch.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The Memory about Merlin.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The Memory with Scrooge McDuck.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
It seems like you're helping Stitch with something here?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Ah yes, I had nearly forgotten.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I was surprised to learn that the furry menace had an interest in astronomy.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
One of the lenses in his telescope had broken, so I made him a replacement.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Interesting.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
Okay Jafar, I've made my decision.

TAG: Jafar_032_f
Maybe doing some good will remind you of how to be a proper member of this community.

TAG: Jafar_033_f
You can stay in the Palace for now, and I'll be in touch soon about what your community service will entail.

TAG: Jafar_034_f
I... This is quite surprising, {PlayerName}. I am not sure I would be so generous were I in your shoes.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Here, please take this. Let it serve as a token of my desire to remain in the Valley.

TAG: Jafar_035_f
Yes, well... isn't that the point of doing good? Because it's good and not because it's easy?

TAG: Jafar_036_f
Be good, Jafar.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Very well.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
You are guilty of attempting to steal Oswald's powers â that wasn't ever in doubt.

TAG: Jafar_026_f
But... we've also confirmed through the Memories that you're at least capable of being a citizen here. However, you used your probation period to just keep being mean.

TAG: Jafar_027_f
So, I am sentencing you to...

TAG: Jafar_028_f
Do not drag it out, {PlayerName}. Tell me: Are you sending me back to the lamp?

TAG: Jafar_029_f
No.

TAG: Jafar_030_f
No?!

TAG: Jafar_031_f
No, instead you'll be doing some community service.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
You and Merlin seem to be in deep discussion on this one.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
As infuriating as that righteous enchanter can be, we did find the occasional topic to discuss.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
If I recall correctly, we were talking about our respective avian familiars.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Owls have inferior cognition in comparison to parrots, but they are at least preferable to cats.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Hmm...

TAG: Jafar_017_f
What are you talking about with Mr. McDuck here?

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Hmm, allow me a moment of reflection...

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Ah yes! We were discussing possible techniques for polishing gemstones.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
I had a theory of how to automate the refining of common gemstones into their shiny variants.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
Did he hire you or something?

TAG: Jafar_022_f
No, I suppose I was motivated by pure scientific inquiry.
