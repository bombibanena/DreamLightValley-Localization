{PlayerName}, tell me... What do you think it means to be a Diamond in the Rough?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Someone with potential but no polish.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A precious gem in raw stone?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It means you're Aladdin.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Precisely.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Though how someone without polish is considered "worthy," I will never understand. Can one be truly worthy if they lack refinement?

TAG: Jafar_003_f
People can be great no matter where they come from.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
How generous of you.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Generous... and perhaps a tad naive.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Yes... But you are being far too literal.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
A Diamond in the Rough is one who has exceptional skill but no refinement.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Hardly. It does not matter what the Cave of Wonders deemed him; that street rat is no diamond, rough or otherwise.
