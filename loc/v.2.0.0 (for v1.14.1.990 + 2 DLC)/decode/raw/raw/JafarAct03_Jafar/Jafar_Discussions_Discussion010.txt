I have watched your work here for quite some time, and you seem to be... exhaustingly virtuous.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Do you not tire of endlessly serving others' needs?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I was destined to help people.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's how I win everyone's trust.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I. AM. SO. TIRED!

TAG: Jafar_003_f
How fortunate for the Valley to have such a generous benefactor.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Wow, thank you, bestie!!!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'll take that as a compliment.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Your words are nice, but the tone not so much.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Never refer to me as that again.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
If you must.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
My most abject and humblest apologies.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
How strategic of you, {PlayerName}. I am impressed.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
... Unless you are only SAYING you win the trust of others to win MY trust...

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
You're a little paranoid, bestie.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
You got me!

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
It worked, didn't it?

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Vigilance is how I have survived all that I have endured.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
I knew it. Well played.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
... Perhaps. Perhaps not. We shall see.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Well, perhaps you ought to unburden yourself of some duties and rest.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Why, I could take numerous responsibilities off your shoulders.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
No thanks, bestie!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Not gonna happen.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
You're really not subtle about looking for control.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
The offer stands... if you NEVER call me that again.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Do not sound so certain, {PlayerName}. You may have need of me yet.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Dear {PlayerName}, whatever could you mean?
