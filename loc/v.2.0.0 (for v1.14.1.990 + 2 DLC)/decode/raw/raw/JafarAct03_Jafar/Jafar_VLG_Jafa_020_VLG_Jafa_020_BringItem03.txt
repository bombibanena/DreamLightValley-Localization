There you go, Jafar. If you can extract the essences from these items, we'll be one step closer to the Gilded Stone.

Each of the Major Essences uses one of the Minor Essences that I brought you â plus two others. I'll have to <Lore>try different combinations</Lore> to figure this out!

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Well, I bid you good fortune in your experimentation.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
I'll try it out now! Oh, and Jafar...

Ursula says that you owe her a favor now, in return for the information she shared.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Oh, how... inconvenient. I am so glad you feel empowered to enter into contracts on my behalf...

TAG: Jafar_013_f
I also got some great info... These items can be refined into something called a <ActivityItem>Minor Essence</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Then if we combine them in the right way, we should get a <ActivityItem>Major Essence</ActivityItem>, which might get us to the Gilded Stone!

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Excellent! While you were away, my own research has uncovered a number of other items that can be refined to interesting substances. Based on your own field research, I may have found additional <ActivityItem>Minor Essences</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Allow me just a moment and...

TAG: Jafar_006_f
...there we are! We should now have sufficient stock for a great deal of experimentation.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
My own experiments, thus far, have yet to yield anything interesting.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Based on what I've learned from Jack Skellington, the Fairy Godmother, and Ursula, that's not surprising.
