Got the <ActivityItem>Dimensional Prism</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Jafar_000_f
To begin, you must <Lore>link the power generators to my machine using the cables from EVE's House</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Next, the <ActivityItem>Dimensional Prism</ActivityItem> must be set on the pedestal.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Then, place the <ActivityItem>Geometrically Impaired Objects</ActivityItem> in the experiment chamber and activate the beams.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
All right, doesn't sound too difficult.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
That remains to be seen. However, I shall be here should you require assistance.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Which would not surprise me in the slightest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No need to get snarky.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh, that sounds like a challenge!

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Excellent! This is precisely what we need to align the machinery.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
While you do that, I shall regulate the power.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Sure, what's the setup?

TAG: Jafar_006_f
First things first... Here you are.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
{PlayerName}, what you deem "snarky," I propose is merely honest.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
I've got this.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
How charming. Go ahead, then... Surprise me.
