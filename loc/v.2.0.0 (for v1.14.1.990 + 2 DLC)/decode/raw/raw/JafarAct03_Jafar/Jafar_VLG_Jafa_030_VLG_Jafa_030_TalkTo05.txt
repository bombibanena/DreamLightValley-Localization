Well, well, look who finally caught up.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Jafar, what's going on here? What are you doing with Oswald?

TAG: Jafar_002_f
As ever, I am expected to do everything for you...

TAG: Jafar_003_f
What does it look like I am doing, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I have no idea.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Like you're draining something from Oswald!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A really strange spa treatment?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Of course. Allow me to enlighten you, one last time.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Go ahead and try. Surprise me.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
From the moment I saw him, I knew there was something special about Oswald.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
The chromatic aberrance. The strange geometry.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
There is power lurking in his uniquely composed body. Power to which he is oblivious, labeling it merely "luck."

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Power which would be far more suited to MY goals.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Don't think you're going to get away with this, Jafar.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Oh {PlayerName}, you are already too late!

TAG: Jafar_013_f
The mechanism is complete. Oswald was lured to his doom. The alchemical process has already begun.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Just wait, Jafar; I'll figure out how to stop you.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Correct! At last, {PlayerName}, you are catching on!

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Thank goodness; I no longer have to pretend to find you amusing.
