A hobby? Whatever for?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
To give you something to do other than take over the Valley.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Ah. Do tell me â what would you recommend?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Journaling.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Embroidery.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Baking.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Journaling? How quaint.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Actually, that would be a good way of keeping track of my... ideas.

Can't you just relax and enjoy yourself?

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Relaxation is permitted only to those who rule absolutely. I presume you were not aware â you work FAR too hard for your station.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Well, I have always wanted an embroidered edge to my cape...

But my skills are more... cerebral. Perhaps I could find a magical way to convince another Villager to do the work.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Surely you jest.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Who do you imagine would eat confections that *I* had a hand in making?

TAG: Jafar_010_f
The nefarious laugh might have something to do with that.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
You are suggesting that I feign benevolence? Interesting...
