You're back! To be honest, I was 50-50 on the chances.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I came back as quick as I could.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've been busy testing the network!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I still think you might be a ghost.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Aw, you're a real pal. Thanks!

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
When you added that photo to the network, I saw these <Lore>pixelated dust bits</Lore> all around me.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
And when I touched one of 'em â I was solid again! Just for a second!

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
And I know where I go when I'm not here...

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
I've been glitching into <Lore>other Dreamlight Valleys!</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_019_f
There are tons of Dreamlight Valleys and Dreamers! And they're all connected â that's the network I'm bouncing around in!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
That's the coolest thing I've ever heard!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Did you still want to stay here?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
The Valleyverse is a THING?

TAG: Vanellope_020_f
Ultra cool with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles on top!

TAG: Vanellope_021_f
Now that I've been all over, I know your Valley is the one I wanna hang out in.

TAG: Vanellope_031_f
I just need something to lock on to... What did Tammy call that thing in Hero's Duty?

TAG: Vanellope_032_f
Oh yeah, a beacon!

TAG: Vanellope_033_f
Make me a beacon, and I can get outta the network. Ya know, something that really calls to me â something that feels like home.

TAG: Vanellope_026_f
What?! Of course I do! I want to hang out with you and see your Village!

TAG: Vanellope_027_f
It's a total thing. A big thing! I've seen every corner of it.

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
That WAS you! Whoo-hoo! 'Cause something happened!

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
I know I keep disappearing like one, but I'm tellin' ya, I'm not a ghost. Anyway...
