Something wrong, Corporal Gymbag?

You have something against 19th-century short pants?

I don't know! It's bonkers at my House right now. I think it's got something to do with that <ActivityItem>Memory Map</ActivityItem> you found after you defeated Scar in our Boss Battle!

<Lore>Could you check it out for me A-S-A-P?</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
That means now!

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Not a bad comeback! I commend you, Captain Junkyard!

Right you are, chum!

It's bonkers at my House right now. I think it's got something to do with that <ActivityItem>Memory Map</ActivityItem> you found in Scar's Cave when you defeated him!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
No! Not at all. I was just trying something. It doesn't matter! Listen!

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
No problemo! ... Is it "later" yet?
