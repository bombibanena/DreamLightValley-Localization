You call that a clue?!

TAG: Vanellope_000_f
Good idea! And I know just the game. I play it with my best buddy Ralph.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
I spy with my little eye something that's... cute!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The critters in the Valley!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you fishing for compliments?

TAG: Vanellope_043_f
Okay, I love a challenge!

TAG: Vanellope_044_f
Is it some kinda jewel...?

TAG: Vanellope_045_f
Gotcha. But I'm warnin' you, I'm gonna come up with some good ones!

TAG: Vanellope_046_f
Good to know my impeccable record speaks for itself!

TAG: Vanellope_047_f
Ha! I eat being underestimated for breakfast! It goes GREAT with cereal!

TAG: Vanellope_048_f
Not what I was thinking of, but now that you mention it... You think I could build a critter army with my princess charm?

TAG: Player_012_choice_000_f
Maybe stick to "I Spy" for fun...

TAG: Player_012_choice_001_f
To unleash a fury of fur and feathers?

TAG: Player_012_choice_002_f
You have charm? Since when?

TAG: Vanellope_049_f
Yeah, now that I think about it, I don't want all those squirrels following me around...

TAG: Vanellope_050_f
Naw, just for fun! Speaking of fun...

TAG: Vanellope_051_f
Ha-ha, good one! You have SEEN me, right?

TAG: Vanellope_052_f
The only fishing I wanna do is EXTREME fishing... for sharks!

TAG: Vanellope_053_f
Besides, I don't need compliments; I know I'm adorable!

TAG: Player_013_choice_000_f
So... you WERE the answer to the game?

TAG: Player_013_choice_001_f
The most adorable!

TAG: Player_013_choice_002_f
Wow, Vanellope. Wow.

TAG: Vanellope_054_f
Sure! But it wasn't a compliment: I was stating an obvious fact.

TAG: Vanellope_055_f
Aw, thanks, pal!

TAG: Vanellope_056_f
Hey, I'm just bein' honest!

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Right-a-reeno! But don't let these baby hazels fool ya: I'm also a racing dynamo!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You can be cute AND a good racer!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Trust me, I know!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You don't look so tough.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Of course! You're looking at exhibit A!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
C'mon, let's play another round. You pick something this time.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yes! I'm ready!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time...

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
That's the spirit! Hit me with that clue!

TAG: Player_003_f
(Hmm, what should I pick?)

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Maybe something red, like Vanellope's hair tie.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Maybe something stripy, like Vanellope's leggings.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Maybe something black, like Vanellope's boots.

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
I spy with my little eye somethiiiing that is RED!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Red... Hmm, any flowers around here?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Nope! Guess again!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Another hint... It's sweet.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
The answer is over your head.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Red... Mickey's pants!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Nope! Guess again.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Huh...? This one's a real head scratcher...

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
It LOOKS edible.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
It holds a lot of something.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
Keep trying!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
It only LOOKS edible?

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
You might be able to eat it. I don't know...

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
Apples? Raspberries? They're red and look edible unless you hate fruit!

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
You're wearing it.

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
Wrong again!

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Red, looks edible, I'm wearing it... OH!

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
My licorice hair tie! Yes!

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
Wow! You are really good at this game!

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
Let's play again sometime!

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
I give up. What is it?!

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
Your licorice hair tie!

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
Can't tell you. Better luck next time!

TAG: Vanellope_019_f
Wow, you are tough! I respect that.

TAG: Vanellope_020_f
What?! This is so confusing!

TAG: Vanellope_021_f
Sheesh. There isn't a lot of red stuff around here...

TAG: Vanellope_022_f
Anna's hair? I mean, her HAIR isn't sweet but Anna is... right?

TAG: Vanellope_023_f
Over my head? An invisible kite that only you can see?

TAG: Vanellope_024_f
I spy with my little eye something that is... stripy!

TAG: Vanellope_025_f
Stripy? What an oh-so specific clue...

TAG: Vanellope_026_f
It's... my leggings! Ha! That was easy!

TAG: Player_008_choice_000_f
Nice work, Vanellope!

TAG: Player_008_choice_001_f
Aw, next time I'll make it tougher...

TAG: Player_008_choice_002_f
I made it easy on purpose!

TAG: Vanellope_027_f
Hey, that was fun!

TAG: Vanellope_028_f
It was still fun!

TAG: Vanellope_029_f
Okay, but next time, I want a REAL challenge!

TAG: Vanellope_030_f
I spy with my little eye something that is... black!

TAG: Vanellope_031_f
My hair!

TAG: Player_009_choice_000_f
Getting warmer...

TAG: Player_009_choice_001_f
Try doing some "sole" searching...

TAG: Player_009_choice_002_f
Um, no. Try again.

TAG: Vanellope_032_f
My skirt? No, that's brown...

TAG: Vanellope_033_f
How about another hint?

TAG: Player_010_choice_000_f
Look down.

TAG: Player_010_choice_001_f
It's BOOT-iful...

TAG: Player_010_choice_002_f
No hints! Guess again!

TAG: Vanellope_034_f
Downâ OH!

TAG: Vanellope_035_f
It's my boots! It's gotta be! Right?!

TAG: Player_011_choice_000_f
You're right!

TAG: Player_011_choice_001_f
Took you long enough!

TAG: Vanellope_036_f
All right! One point for me!

TAG: Vanellope_037_f
That was fun!

TAG: Vanellope_038_f
Hey, that was a trickier clue than I thought.

TAG: Vanellope_039_f
But kudos to you for challenging me! I'm pretty much an expert at this.

TAG: Vanellope_040_f
Huh... You said that funny... Why did youâ OH! I got it!

TAG: Vanellope_041_f
You're tough, hmm... OH!
