Gotta hand it to ya; you bake a mean kart body, my friend. Now we just need the nuts and bolts...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's on the list?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We need parts for a replica?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Like... hazelnuts?

So glad you asked!

Since this isn't a world powered by candy, I'm pretty sure we're gonna need actual <Lore>electronics for its guts and something to power it up.</Lore>

I bet WALLÂ·E has a power source and electronic junk we can use. Just swing by his place and grab it. And don't worry; he lets me borrow stuff all the time.

We'll also need something to act like glue to hold it together. Maybe <Lore>ask a Villager who knows lots about pastries.</Lore>

Then, when you've got <Lore>a power source, electronic parts, and something to glue the kart parts together</Lore>, bring it all to me!

In the meantime, I'm gonna see if Ursula left anything mysterious in that cave she was trapped in! Bye!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
An EXACT replica.

Ha-ha, good one! I'm talking electronic parts.
