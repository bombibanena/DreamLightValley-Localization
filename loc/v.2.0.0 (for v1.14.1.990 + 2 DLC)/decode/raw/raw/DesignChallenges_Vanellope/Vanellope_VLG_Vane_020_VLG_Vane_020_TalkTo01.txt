That's it?! That's what you do for fun around here?! I got news for you, chum...

Those aren't games. They're hobbies at best and WORK at worst!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's a little harsh.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We'll find something else for you to try.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Please meditate on your need for adrenaline.

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Hey, I'm just callin' 'em like I see 'em.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
We tried things your way, now we try mine! I have just invented a mind-blowing game.

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
I hide somewhere in the Valley, and you have to come FIND me.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Do you mean "hide-and-seek"? That game already exists.

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Pfft, please! This isn't some kid's game. This is EXTREME. I'm gonna pick one of the <Lore>darkest, most dangerous spots</Lore> in the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds fun! I'm in!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are there any special rules?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Again, this is LITERALLY just hide-and-seek.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Yes! I knew I could count on you, {PlayerName}! Let's play!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
You go inside somewhere so I can hide. Maybe <Lore>try Mr. McDuck's shop, and don't forget to count to ten.</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Just one...

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
It's not! You'll see, I promise!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Worry not, my friend! I'm on it!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
"Meditate"? Are you hearing yourself?!
