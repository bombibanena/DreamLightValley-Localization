Seems like you're the one running things in the Valley. Guess that kinda makes you royalty too.

What's your favorite thing about being in charge around here?

Everyone in the Valley has equal say!

Having the magic to help my friends.

Doing things my own way.

How very FAIR and JUST of you, my royal pal!

Yep, there's nothin' better than helping your friends out of a jam.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Especially if that jam is raspberry.
