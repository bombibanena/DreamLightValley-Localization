All right, you got the potions! Are you ready for this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This is a really bad idea.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You know those aren't real potions, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Full steam ahead!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Too late to back out now.

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Before you go in there, here's a big boss hint: Watch her attack patterns. When Ursula raises her tentacles, it's go time!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great hint! Thanks, Vanellope!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm starting to get a little scared...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Does it have to be Ursula?

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Let's do this!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
We've got competition in our code, buckets of boba tea, and each other. Destiny awaits!

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Don't be scared, pal. I'll be right there as your battle companion!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Uh, yeah! A magic wielder with tentacles is a boss battle classic!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Uh, yeah. But have you tried these? They're DELICIOUS!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Ha! I knew you were a fellow competition fiend!
