You're here! Great! I just need one more second and then I can show you the weird thing.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Close your eyes, 'kay?

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
What's this?! A weird and magical chest has appeared totally on its own! But it's locked! How bizarre.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You put it there, didn't you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's in the chest?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is this a trap?

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Shh! Just sink into the suspense! The suspense of...

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
My Game Funquest!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A game? Sounds great. I'm in!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Funquest. Like a quest but also fun?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What's this all about, Vanellope?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Yes! I knew I could count on you. Here's how it works...

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
On the Internet, I found games people play WITHOUT joysticks or controllers.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
And I had SO much fun doing Boss Battles with you, I made a special game to thank you for being so cool and welcoming me to your Valley!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
This is so sweet, Vanellope!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Are you playing the game too?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
We're not going to bother Ursula again, right?

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Oh, I'm not Vanellope anymore. Call me... the Storyteller!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Ahem. Our story begins... in a kingdom in a faraway place. (And I don't mean the strip mall down the street.) In this kingdom, there's an evil Mastermind who wants all the fun for himself!

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
To save all the fun from the Mastermind's clutches, the Princess locked it away in a chest. She hid the three keys to the chest RIGHT before she was kidnapped!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Now everyone in the kingdom is so bored, their brains are like old, chewed bubblegum.

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
There's only one person who can save 'em from being bored forever and rescue the Princess from the Mastermind... Duh-duh-duh... The Hero!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
Time for you to choose a backstory. What kind of hero do you want to be?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
A humble Farmer.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
A tech-savvy Futurist.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
An elegant Noble.

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
A classic! I love it! All right, Hero, you need to dress the part. <Lore>Change into some Rustic clothes.</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
And remember: If you don't have something to wear, you can <Lore>order something from Mr. McDuck's shop.</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
When you're all dressed up, come back to your Storyteller: the most esteemed... me!

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
A visionary! Nice! All right, Hero, you need to dress the part. <Lore>Change into some Futuristic clothes.</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
A bold and brave fancypants! All right, Hero, time to dress the part. <Lore>Change into some Elegant duds.</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_019_f
Yes, and no. I'll be guiding you through your adventure. From here on out, Vanellope von Schweetz is no more! I'm the Storyteller!

TAG: Vanellope_020_f
Nope! I've made lots of new friends... and we're all gonna play together. From here on out, I'm not Vanellope. I'm the Storyteller!

TAG: Vanellope_021_f
Right-a-mundo! Now listen, here's how it works...

TAG: Vanellope_022_f
It'll be a blast! I promise. Let me explain the rules...

TAG: Vanellope_023_f
So glad you asked, {PlayerName}! You'll get what's inside this special chest if you complete...

TAG: Vanellope_024_f
No! Who do you think I am?! Although... you might encounter some traps...

TAG: Vanellope_025_f
In my GAME FUNQUEST!
