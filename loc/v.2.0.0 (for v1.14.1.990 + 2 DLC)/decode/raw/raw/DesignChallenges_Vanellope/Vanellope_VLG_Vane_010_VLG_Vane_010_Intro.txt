Hey, {PlayerName}! I've been thinkin'... Your Valley is totally great, but it MIGHT be missing something... Got a sec?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
For you? Always!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll talk to you later.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Okay, so I can't believe you have all this space, and all this neat stuff, but you don't have a CANDY BIOME!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a sweet idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
There's a Beach? Did you see the Beach?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That sounds sticky.

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
So glad you agree, chum!

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
If I'm gonna stay, we'll hafta make some candy-related changes around here. I may no longer be a Sugar Rush racer, but my love for candy never dies.

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
First things first: landscaping. Take these <ActivityItem>Candy Cane Seeds</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
These look like normal candy...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Can I eat these?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Are you pranking me?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
They are candy. Kinda. Special tree-sprouting candy. You'll see.

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
<Lore>Plant 'em, sprout 'em and then bring 'em to me when you're done.</Lore> In the meantime, I'll try to find some more stuff around here that we can use to decorate.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Wouldn't recommend it, pal, unless you want a tree-sized stomachache!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Oh please, WHEN I prank you, it'll be way funnier than asking you to bury candy in the ground. Trust me.

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
I did, BUT it's all sand and no sugar. A missed opportunity.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Uh, yeah! Sticky and awesome.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Okay, but I'm tellin' ya, my ideas are golden! See ya later, sourball!
