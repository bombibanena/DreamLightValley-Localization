You gotta help me! I think the Forgetting is getting me!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
I can't remember the name of those mission thingies you check in the Wishing Wells!

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Dreamlight... tasks? Ooh, it's on the tip of my tongue!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Dreamlight Duties?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh no, not this again!

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
That's it! Dreamlight DOODIES! Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Better take a bath, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
You're up to your neck in doodies!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You got me again!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're not tired of this joke yet?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
These doodie jokes stink!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Yep! Thanks for being such a good sport, pal!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Good one! Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Whatever are you referencing, sweet friend?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You know what I'm talking about.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I thought you were really in trouble!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You WEREN'T trying to make me say "duties"?

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
I can't believe you won't help your good pal Vanellope remember the name of the Dreamlight thingies!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Am I neglecting my duties?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'm not going to say it!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Ha-ha-ha... Aw, {PlayerName}, you said "doodie" just for me!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
Okay, fine! Just remember that I'm small, stubborn, and I never back down from a challenge.

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
Well, if you make sure I'm okay AND tell me what those Dreamlight things are called, can we say you're doing DOUBLE DOODIE?

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Ha-ha-ha. It never gets old!

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
No, I was! You might say, it's your "doodie"!
