Hey, {PlayerName}! {PlayerName}! I know what this place is missing! Ready? You're gonna love it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's your big idea?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm busy right now.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
We need to have BOSS BATTLES!

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Ya know, that final epic struggle with a mega-baddie! That'll really put some sprinkles on your sundae!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
This sounds like a horrible idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm going to need more context...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Mmm, sprinkles.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
What are you talking about?! It's the greatest idea since the modern confection engine, and here's why...

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Challenging some villains to boss battles is a GOOD thing.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
I'm a born racer â coded for competition. And when we played all those Mini-Games together, it made me feel EXHILARATED!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Bad guys wanna be bad, right? Let's help 'em scratch that itch!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Seems like a good way to make enemies...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You know, that almost makes sense?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Okay, I'm in. What do we need?

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Trust me! My buddy Ralph and his game nemesis Fix-It Felix Jr. battle it out all day, every day, and they're great friends!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Here's the plan: We're gonna battle three Valley villains.

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
But! We have to be prepared for things to get rough so <Lore>cook up some potions!</Lore> Take these recipes!

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
When that's done, <Lore>find me and we'll head to Ursula's!</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
It makes oodles of sense!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
SWEET!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
Yeah, sprinkles are great! Especially the chocolate ones... But that's beside the point. Eyes on me!

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Gotcha. But come find me soon! This is gonna blow your mind!
