Okay, okay â hold on. {PlayerName}, the flowers, the chocolate, it's way too much.

I wrote to Daisy asking for advice on making a special BOUQUET. I know some flowers have meanings, and she's so glamorous, I thought she'd be a great person to ask, but...

Anna saw all the flowers in front of the castle and thought I was trying to apologize for something.

That and she's a little worried we're under siege by magical flowers.

I had to convince her it was just meant to be a nice gesture and not some sort of... garden invasion.

I knew it, but Daisy insisted.

What do you mean?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think you mean "thank you so much."

I just wanted some advice on which flowers to pick for my fiancÃ©e.

I DO appreciate the effort, but...
