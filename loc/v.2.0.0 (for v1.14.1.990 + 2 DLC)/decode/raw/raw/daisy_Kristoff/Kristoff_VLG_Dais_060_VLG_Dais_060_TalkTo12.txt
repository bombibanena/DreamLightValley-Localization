Wow, {PlayerName}, I was expecting this gala to end with a bang... but not a literal one.

It wasn't in Daisy's plan. It was a prank. I'm trying to piece together what might have happened.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What's your alibi?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Did you see anything?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
CONFESS, ICE MAN!

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Alibi...? Me? Well...

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
I spent the whole gala talking with the other guests.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Minnie told me you helped launch their Dots & Daisies business AND the Dreamlight Gazette.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
And Donald was really grateful because you settled an issue between him and Daisy. Something about a wardrobe and a hammer? I'm not sure I got it all.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
I guess the only thing I can tell you for sure is that everyone around here likes you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Thanks, Kristoff. I'm pretty sure you're innocent.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Nice to know, but not helpful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not exactly a rock-solid alibi.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
What? Oh, yeah, the glitter thing. I totally forgot. Well, good luck with the investigation.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Yeah, sorry I couldn't be more help.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
I don't know what to say. I told you everything I remember.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Glitter? Lots of glitter. Other than that...

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Confess to what?
