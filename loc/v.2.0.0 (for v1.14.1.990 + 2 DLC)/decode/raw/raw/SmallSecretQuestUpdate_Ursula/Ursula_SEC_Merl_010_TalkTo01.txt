Ursula, I saw you speaking to Mother Gothel...

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Oh, you've been spying on me, have you?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
I wouldn't have dreamed you'd stoop as low as that windbag wizard. I'll bet he put you up to this, didn't he?

TAG: Player_000_f
Merlin asked me to see what you and Mother Gothel are scheming about.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I know you're up to no good.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm just trying to prove him wrong.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He might be acting like a bit of a busybody...

TAG: Ursula_003_f
No good?! HA! Why, I've been a model citizen, dear.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
All I was doing was lending a bit of help to a neighbor.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Mother Gothel needed something to keep her House free of pests. So I offered her a little tincture to take care of the problem.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
But I'm afraid it's impossible to get rid of the real pests around here. Like that bombastic goody-two-shoes, Merlin.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm not buying it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I guess we shouldn't have judged you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
So you and Mother Gothel are friends?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Fine. Tell that wizard whatever you like, as long as it keeps him out of my hair.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Ugh! It's getting so someone can't even socialize around here without being accused of nefarious schemes. Can you imagine?

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Be a dear, {PlayerName}. Tell that pompous prig to leave us be, would you?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'll tell him to leave you alone.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll think about it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Not a chance. We'll be watching you, Ursula.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Thanks, angelfish. Trust me... it's for his own good.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
If Merlin keeps bothering me, someone might slip something into his tea that turns him into a toadstool.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Entirely by accident, of course.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Well, it is for his own good, angelfish.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Fine. But there may be consequences.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Was that a hint of an apology in your voice? FINALLY!

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Friends? Well... I suppose I don't find her company all that terrible. So yes, you might say we are.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
It's hopeless, angelfish. The blithering fool's made up his mind.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
Only a BIT of a busybody? You have a talent for understatement, my dear.
