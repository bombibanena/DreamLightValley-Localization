Glad you're here, {PlayerName}. You and I have serious work to do!

My clue was buried in front of my RV. It's just a drawing with a simple sun on it and some trees? Plus something else.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
What do you think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The drawing is the location of your flag.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I have ZERO idea...

Of course! Let's have another look. Trees... Are those <Lore>animal bones</Lore>? And there's a <Lore>large sun</Lore> over the landscape.

A <Lore>sunny place with trees and bones</Lore>? I'll have a look around.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Excellent! Remember: I had to <Lore>dig up our clue</Lore>, so you might have to dig up the flag. Bring your shovel!

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Let's look together... Are those <Lore>animal bones</Lore>? Plus a <Lore>large sun</Lore> over the landscape...

Affirmative, it is adorable. But that doesn't help us find our Mini Flag.
