Oh, hello, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Do you remember when you and the Fairy Godmother helped me find <Lore>100 sticks</Lore>?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes! What was that about?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I've been trying to forget...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Well, you're about to find out!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
I needed them for an extremely top-secret project that no one knows about.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Wait... Do you know about my extremely top-secret project that no one knows about?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Does it involve a lot of sticks...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, but I'm very scared to find out!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
If it's so secret, why would I know about it?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
As a matter of fact... yes!

TAG: Olaf_010_f
I can finally reveal that I spent the last week turning those <Lore>100 sticks</Lore>...

TAG: Olaf_011_f
...

TAG: Olaf_012_f
...into...

TAG: Olaf_013_f
...ten <ActivityItem>Sturdy Chairs</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Oh, nice! Those will be useful!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
... What? That's it? Chairs?

TAG: Olaf_014_f
I think so too. Chairs can be used for so many things!

TAG: Olaf_016_f
You can sit on them, stand on them to reach high shelves, use them to make a blanket fort, attach them to a reindeer as a makeshift sleigh...

TAG: Olaf_017_f
So many possibilities! Actually, I find it a bit overwhelming. Here. Why don't you decide what to do with them?

TAG: Olaf_015_f
{PlayerName}, never underestimate the value of a sturdy chair.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, the only thing to be afraid of is the ever-increasing uncertainty of life and the universe. But never mind that.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Just making sure it was as top secret as I planned. Well...

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Oh, don't do that! You're about to find out why.
