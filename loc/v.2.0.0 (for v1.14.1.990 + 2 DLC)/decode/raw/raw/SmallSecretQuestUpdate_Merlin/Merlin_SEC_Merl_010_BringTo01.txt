Hm? What have you got there, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Ah-ha! My notes! Why, I've been looking everywhere for those.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
And it's a good thing you found them, too. I wouldn't have wanted them to fall into the wrong hands.

TAG: Player_000_f
I couldn't understand what they said.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Must be important wizard business.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What are these all about?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They're just gibberish!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I suppose that's true, in a sense.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
You see, I fear there's nefarious business afoot. So I began noting down my observations.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Mother Gothel and Ursula have been meeting all around the Village. Those two are up to no good, I just know it! You can't trust either of them!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
That's why I've been keeping track of their little meetings. Four times now, I've caught them scheming together.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
They've been exchanging all manner of, well, of mysterious ingredients and vials. And the moment I draw near, they clam up and run off!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Er, though, I suppose in Ursula's case, I mean to say "swim off."

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They must be up to no good.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds suspicious. But we need proof.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Probably nothing. Leave them alone.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Of course they are! But I suppose we should get some proof of exactly what they're up to. I'm afraid my magic only shows me so much.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Ursula and Mother Gothel both trust you far more than they do me. Perhaps we can use that to our advantage.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
I suspect that you could get close enough to hear what they're scheming about.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
The fate of Dreamlight Valley depends on it!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll only do it so you'll leave them alone.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm kind of curious now too!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Oh dear. Well, I... uh... I certainly hope that's not the case. More likely, it's just some petty scheme they've concocted. But we can't be too careful with those two.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Now, I may not be able to prognosticate what Mother Gothel and Ursula are scheming about...

TAG: Merlin_014_f
...but I do know precisely where they'll be meeting next.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
They gather each day in the Glade of Trust.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
They already met there earlier today, so you'll have to <Lore>wait until tomorrow to catch them.</Lore> Remember: the Glade of Trust!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Oh, balderdash! Go investigate and you'll see. Ursula and Mother Gothel could prove quite a thorn in our side if they join forces.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Well now, curiosity is a fine reason to act! There is that old adage about it being rather unkind to cats... But every great discovery springs forth from at least a bit of curiosity.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Well, yes... uh... you're quite right. And my soothsaying abilities can only tell us so much. We've got to know exactly what they're up to.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
You're far too trusting, {PlayerName}. Trouble follows those two like a shadow.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
But I suppose if you could prove that they AREN'T up to any villainous business, well... then my worries will be eased.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
But you'll have to bring me that proof! I'm afraid my soothsaying abilities can only tell us so much.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Hardly! You just have to know how to read them.
