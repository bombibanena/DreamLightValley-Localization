Well then, what's all this?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Heh-heh, I don't recall requesting such an extravagant meal. Though I am a bit peckish...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
It's a "thank you" meal, courtesy of me and Remy.

TAG: Player_000_f
We wanted to show our gratitude to you for taking care of this Village during the Forgetting. And for being...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...the greatest wizard in any century.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...even more marvelous than indoor plumbing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...the only one who knows what's going on half the time.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Oh, goodness... Why, that's quite kind of you both. Though I hope you don't think I stayed behind in the Valley for accolades.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Actually, I'm... well, I'm afraid I haven't the faintest idea what to say.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I suppose, hmm... I suppose I never expected a thank-you. I was simply doing what was right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A "you're welcome" should cover it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No need to say anything. Just enjoy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Merlin... do you have tears in your eyes?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
I expect it would... Ahem... You're most welcome.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Acts of kindness like this meal are what hold this Valley together, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I shall!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Huh? Why, uh, uh, no. Of course not. It's just some... some blasted Dreamlight in my eye, that's all!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
... Oh, all right. I admit your gesture has me a little teary.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Oh. Well, then I must be marvelous indeed, mustn't I? Heh-heh.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Heh-heh, well, it helps to have glimpsed the future... and to have a great deal of books to consult.
