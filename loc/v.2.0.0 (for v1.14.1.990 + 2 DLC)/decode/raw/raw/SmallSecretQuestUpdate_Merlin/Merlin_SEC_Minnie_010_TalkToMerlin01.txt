Ah, {PlayerName}. I believe I know precisely why you've come to speak to me today.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
It's Minnie, isn't it? She's gotten herself in quite a jumble, worrying she might disappear again, hasn't she?

TAG: Player_000_f
It's Minnie, all right. She asked me to come talk to you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We need a wizard for this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She didn't want to bother you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You know. Since you're Mr. Magic Guy.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Hmm, well, yes, I... uh... I suppose you do, for matters such as this.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Is there anything in your magic books that might help?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Actually, I've given it quite a lot of careful thought, and I think I know precisely how we can fix this predicament.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
We'll use the most powerful kind of magic there is. First, you'll need to speak to some Villagers and ask them what they like best about Minnie.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Hmm... maybe I should <Lore>ask Elsa, Anna, and Moana.</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_007_f
And listen closely â this part is key. Once you've spoken to them, you must bring me some <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
With all that, we can sort out Minnie's dilemma... or at least, I very much hope we can.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Nonsense. She could never be a bother. I'm happy to assist in such matters.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Er, thank you... I suppose. Though I'm not terribly fond of that moniker.
