Well, I think that wraps up your contest! How are you feeling?

TAG: Tiana_001_f
Well, I could do with a tall glass of iced tea.

TAG: Tiana_002_f
But I'm pleased as punch. It was so nice to see other Villagers connect with some of my favorite New Orleans dishes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
There's a LOT to love there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It was important to you â of course people would enjoy it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
"Devour" might be more accurate than "connect."

TAG: Tiana_003_f
More than you can imagine!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
So what's the plan now?

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Well, I want to write down some notes about the whole contest. Just a few ideas in case I want to do this again.

TAG: Tiana_008_f
But before that, I'm going to go have a little fun!

TAG: Tiana_009_f
Excellent! What'll you do?

TAG: Tiana_013_f
Oh, I want to go sailing with Moana, do some tastings with Remy, and go spend some time with Little Louis.

TAG: Tiana_010_f
And after that... well, let's just say I want to bring a classic New Orleans tradition to the Valley!

TAG: Tiana_011_f
Oooh, exciting!

TAG: Tiana_012_f
Thanks again, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Tiana_004_f
True â everyone's so kind here.

TAG: Tiana_005_f
*laugh* You're right!
