Hey, Tiana. What are you up to?

TAG: Tiana_001_f
{PlayerName}, I've just had the most wonderful idea! Could you help me out with it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure, let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's gonna have to be later, I'm afraid.

TAG: Tiana_002_f
What's your idea?

TAG: Tiana_003_f
Well, I want to teach some of the Villagers here how to cook like I do at my restaurant, specifically the Cajun recipes.

TAG: Tiana_004_f
That's cool!

TAG: Tiana_005_f
I'm so glad you think so. Sharing cooking tips is always fun, and we can make it even more fun by having a little contest.

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Plus, if I'm ever not available to cook the meals for Tiana's Meal Stall, it'll be nice to know there are some folks here who can fill in for me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You planning on getting stuck in a cookbook again?

TAG: Tiana_008_f
Do you have any contestants in mind?

TAG: Tiana_009_f
You might say I have a tentative menu already!

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Could you talk to <Lore>Woody</Lore>, <Lore>Anna</Lore>, <Lore>Kristoff</Lore>, <Lore>Mike</Lore>, and <Lore>Mulan</Lore>?

TAG: Tiana_011_f
I'll work on sources for the Ingredients, decide on recipes and set up the contest kitchen.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
Sure, you do that and I'll find your contestants for you!

TAG: Tiana_013_f
Thank you! Once you're done, please <Lore>meet me back in Remy's House</Lore>. It's the perfect spot for an impromptu culinary school!

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Goodness, no! But I will want to take a day off on occasion.
