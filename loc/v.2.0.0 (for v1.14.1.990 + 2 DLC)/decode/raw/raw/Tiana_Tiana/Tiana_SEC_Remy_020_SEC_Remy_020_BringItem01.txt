Oh, Tiana! It's really you!

TAG: Tiana_004_f
Sure is. But um... how did I get here?

TAG: Tiana_005_f
Well, that might be a little complicated. What's the last thing you remember?

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Well... Merlin had lent me a magical cookbook, and I was trying out some new dishes. He warned me not to change the recipes because some magical books have tempers.

TAG: Tiana_001_f
But I just couldn't imagine making jambalaya without at least a dash of hot sauce!

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Then, after I finished the jambalaya, I took the book to Remy to show him the new recipes... and the book started shaking in my hands! I dropped it, then its pages started turning real fast! Next thing I knew, I was off the ground and then... nothing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It seems like you were trapped in the cookbook!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh wow, that's kinda scary!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Well, I'm glad you're okay now.

TAG: Tiana_009_f
Trapped?! Oh my... How did I get out?

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Well, in one sense, I brought you back...

TAG: Tiana_011_f
...but in another, YOU did! I managed to figure out this recipe and shared it with some of the Villagers you shared it with before.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
You did? That's wonderful! My daddy always said sharing food with friends is its own type of magic!

TAG: Tiana_013_f
So, now that you're back in the Valley, any plans? I have a feeling things have changed a lot since you went into the book.

TAG: Tiana_014_f
Well, I want to visit with my friends, of course. And I do have some new recipe ideas to test and share.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I want to try some shrimp dishes that you made!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm sure everyone will be beating down your door to try them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You and Remy will have so much fun!

TAG: Tiana_015_f
But before I can do anything, I'll need somewhere to stay. Think you could <Lore>help me get my House set up</Lore>?

TAG: Tiana_016_f
Absolutely!

TAG: Tiana_017_f
Thank you kindly, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Tiana_000_f
It was! But... how did I get back here?

TAG: Tiana_002_f
Me too but... How did I get back here?
