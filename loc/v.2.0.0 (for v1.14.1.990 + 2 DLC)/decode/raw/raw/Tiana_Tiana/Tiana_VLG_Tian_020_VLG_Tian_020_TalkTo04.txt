There we go â Little Louis is free!

TAG: Tiana_002_f
Oh, I'm so glad!

TAG: Tiana_003_f
But... what if he gets hungry and I'm not here to feed him?

TAG: Tiana_004_f
Well, he'd probably eat what all the other crocs here eat, no?

TAG: Tiana_005_f
The waters in the Glade of Trust are full of tasty lobsters for him to catch!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
That's true. And I'll be sure to bring him gumbo as often as I can...

TAG: Tiana_007_f
But I do worry about him out here. What if after being in that human cage, the other crocodiles don't welcome him back?

TAG: Tiana_008_f
I suppose what I'm saying is... what if being just a regular crocodile doesn't make him happy anymore?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Little Louis must be a special croc!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is Little Louis a person Merlin transformed?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess he has gotten a taste of the high life...

TAG: Tiana_016_f
He really is!

TAG: Tiana_014_f
If you want to do something for Little Louis, especially after he was confined... I'm happy to help.

TAG: Tiana_015_f
Oh, thank you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Tiana_018_f
I was thinking we could <Lore>make him a little shelter</Lore>. Would you help me?

TAG: Tiana_009_f
I have this... It should help you get started.

TAG: Tiana_020_f
That sounds so cute! On it!

TAG: Tiana_012_f
*laugh* I don't think so.

TAG: Tiana_013_f
But he's definitely different from the other crocodiles.

TAG: Tiana_017_f
That's my fear.
