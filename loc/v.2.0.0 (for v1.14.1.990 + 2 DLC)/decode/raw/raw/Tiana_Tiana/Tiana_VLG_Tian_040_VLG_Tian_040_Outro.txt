Oh {Playername}, thank you so much!

TAG: Tiana_001_f
Our Mardi Gras parade was just what I hoped for!

TAG: Tiana_002_f
Happy to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I had a blast too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We're doing this again, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I love when people bring new traditions to the Valley.

TAG: Tiana_003_f
I'm so glad.

TAG: Tiana_014_f
...thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Tiana_015_f
And please... take this.

TAG: Tiana_016_f
Oh my, thank you!

TAG: Tiana_017_f
Now, I think I'm going to go and enjoy some of this Valley sunshine without anything on my to-do list!

TAG: Tiana_018_f
Great! And if you need anything at all, you know how to find me.

TAG: Tiana_006_f
I couldn't have done it without your help, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
When I got back to the Valley, I was afraid things would feel odd after being gone so long.

TAG: Tiana_008_f
But you helped me get Tiana's Meal Stall going. And rescued Little Louis...

TAG: Tiana_009_f
Then you helped me share my cooking traditions with more cooks. And you were a big part of the first Valley Mardi Gras parade.

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Guess I really had nothing to worry about, did I?

TAG: Tiana_011_f
You're always welcome here, Tiana, and I'm not the only one happy to help you out.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
I know, you're right...

TAG: Tiana_013_f
But you set the example here. So from the bottom of my heart...

TAG: Tiana_004_f
Oh, I'd love that! After all, it is an annual tradition in New Orleans.

TAG: Tiana_005_f
And we love that you're so welcoming of all those traditions.
