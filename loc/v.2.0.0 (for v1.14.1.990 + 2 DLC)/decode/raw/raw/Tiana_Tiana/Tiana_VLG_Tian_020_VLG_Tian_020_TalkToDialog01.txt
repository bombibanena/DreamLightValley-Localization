Hmm... That's strange. I can't find Little Louis anywhere.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Maybe he's just in the water?

TAG: Tiana_008_f
Could be. But usually he comes running as soon as I arrive.

TAG: Tiana_001_f
I've been feeding him gumbo, and he absolutely loves it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Huh, usually the crocs go for lobster...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe he's full?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What if he's asleep?

TAG: Tiana_018_f
Well, maybe Little Louis is a culinarily adventurous crocodile. *laugh*

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Should we ask around if anyone has seen him?

TAG: Tiana_011_f
That's a wonderful idea! Let's <Lore>ask Mother Gothel</Lore>!

TAG: Tiana_000_f
She seems to know the Glade well, so I'm sure she'll be able to help.

TAG: Player_001_f
Go see Mother Gothel?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Uhh...

TAG: Tiana_015_f
Let's go!

TAG: Tiana_021_f
Is something wrong?

TAG: Tiana_022_f
It's just... well, you'll see.

TAG: Tiana_019_f
Little Louis, full? I haven't seen that yet.

TAG: Tiana_020_f
Maybe...
