We are. He loves cooking as much as I do. Maybe even more!

You both make delicious food!

You could probably teach him a few things in the kitchen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Seems like you'd be rivals.

TAG: Tiana_001_f
Well, thank you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Tiana_004_f
We've already exchanged a few recipes.

One day I think it'd be fun for us to put together a Valley cookbook.

TAG: Tiana_002_f
I already have. And he's taught me a thing or two as well!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
We always learn plenty from one another when we talk about food.

TAG: Tiana_003_f
Not at all! Everyone's got their own style of cooking.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Sure, we enjoy a friendly competition...

TAG: Tiana_008_f
...but at the end of the day, we respect each other's talent.
