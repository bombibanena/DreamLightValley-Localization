Hey Tiana, I've got all your outdoor seating and tables set up!

TAG: Tiana_002_f
I saw. It looks just peachy keen!

TAG: Tiana_003_f
It's looking a lot less cluttered in here too. I guess Merlin's enchantment did the trick, huh?

TAG: Tiana_004_f
Oh, it was a timesaver and a half! Though one of the brushes did keep trying to clean the dishes I was still using.

TAG: Tiana_005_f
Still, I think we're nearly ready!

{PlayerName}, would you do the honor of officially opening Tiana's Meal Stall for business?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh wow, I'd love to!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You sure you don't want to?

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Here you go. I'll make sure the guests are all here, and you can place this to kick off the inauguration whenever you're ready!

TAG: Tiana_008_f
Great, thanks Tiana!

TAG: Tiana_011_f
You've been such a huge part of making this happen, so I'd really like you to do it.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
Aww, that's too nice.
