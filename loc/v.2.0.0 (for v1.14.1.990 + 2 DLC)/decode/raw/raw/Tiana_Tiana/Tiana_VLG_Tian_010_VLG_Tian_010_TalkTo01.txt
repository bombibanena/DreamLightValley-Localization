And let's ask <Lore>Mother Gothel</Lore> too. I think she might appreciate some New Orleans classics.

Tiana, the food in your Stall is incredible!

TAG: Tiana_005_f
I'm glad you like it! I was thinking we might sell an accompaniment that'll spice up any dish...

What do you think of selling hot pepper sauce?

TAG: Tiana_007_f
I think that's a great idea! Do you need a hand with the pepper sauce?

TAG: Tiana_008_f
I think I should be good for now. I just need to start recipe testing and get the first batch of sauce going.

But... it would be nice to invite some of the Villagers to taste the food when it's ready. After all, when you have a new venue, you've got to have a grand opening, right?

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Sure! Anyone in particular that I should invite?

TAG: Tiana_011_f
Oh... Well, <Lore>Moana</Lore> mentioned that she really liked the Enchanted Shrimp ÃtouffÃ©e when I spoke to her earlier. Would you invite her?

Cool â on it!
