I want to make sure we won't get in each other's way with my new takeaway spot...

The cuisine's going to be mostly Cajun.

Good call. French and Cajun cuisines definitely have some common elements.

You're right. A lot of Cajun dishes start with the trinity â onions, bell pepper, and celery.

That's extremely close to the French mirepoix â onions, carrots, and celery!

Well... how about I'll do mostly Cajun dishes...

TAG: Tiana_001_f
...and you can do mostly traditional French dishes?

Deal! We'll each have our specialties and room to be creative.
