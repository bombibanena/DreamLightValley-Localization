Here we are! And here's your <ActivityItem>Parade Float Mask</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Wow, it looks great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've never worn a float as a mask before.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm ready for the parade!

TAG: Tiana_001_f
Daisy did such a beautiful job! And I've been busy on the parade throws. Wouldn't be a Mardi Gras parade without them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Throws?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
This is gonna be so fun!

TAG: Tiana_003_f
You've never heard of parade throws?

TAG: Tiana_004_f
Afraid not.

TAG: Tiana_011_f
They're fun little trinkets that get tossed during a parade, and folks race to pick them all up.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
But I think I'll leave what the actual objects are as a fun surprise for you to discover!

TAG: Tiana_005_f
But a little hint â look for green, yellow and purple objects. One ISN'T slimy, one smells lovely and the other has a wonderfully sweet taste!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Great!

TAG: Tiana_008_f
Well, I think we're just about ready to go.

TAG: Tiana_009_f
Once you're dressed for the parade, <Lore>place the New Orleans Parade Arch</Lore> and then follow me!

TAG: Tiana_002_f
Make sure you're ready for when they go flying!
