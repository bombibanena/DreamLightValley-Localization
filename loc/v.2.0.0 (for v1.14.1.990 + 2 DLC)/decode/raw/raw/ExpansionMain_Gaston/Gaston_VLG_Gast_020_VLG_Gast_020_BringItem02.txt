What? These aren't treasures...

TAG: Gaston_006_f
They're just... junk!

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Still, I did work hard to find them. That's got to count for something.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Gaston, we talked about this...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
"We," Gaston. "We" found them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hey, I helped!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Don't you know by now that I'm a man of action, not talk?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
At least now we can track down who they belong to!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Me?

TAG: Gaston_012_f
No! Remember what I told you about appearing like a hero?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Oh, right. I suppose we can return them then.

TAG: Player_001_f
We've got a <ActivityItem>Brush</ActivityItem>, a <ActivityItem>Light Bulb</ActivityItem>, and a <ActivityItem>Climbing Pick</ActivityItem>... Let's take a closer look.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The brush...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The light bulb...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The climbing pick...

TAG: Gaston_014_f
There are some very long hairs in here!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
But they're all bleached after being in the desert so long â no way to tell who they belonged to from the color.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Let's go talk to different Villagers and see if we can figure out the rightful owners!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I made notes in case your memory isn't as razor-sharp as mine.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Ugh... fine.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Onwards! I'll keep the items with me for now so I can return them myself and receive my rightful praise.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
I've never seen such an item before.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
They make light! They can be used for all sorts of things like bright decorations, grow lights for plants, and so much more.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Hmm... sounds like something Belle's father would make.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Someone with a taste for adventure owned that one!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Definitely!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Really? I could have sworn I did it all by myself.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I suppose.
