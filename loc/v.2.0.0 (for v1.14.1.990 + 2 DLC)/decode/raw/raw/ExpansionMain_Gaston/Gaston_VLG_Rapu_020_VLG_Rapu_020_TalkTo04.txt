What... is that horrible creature over in the corner?!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Its head is so round, and its eyes are so still. It's HIDEOUS!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's poised to strike!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
SAVE US ALL, GASTON!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Fight it, or whatever...

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Not if I strike first...

TAG: Gaston_006_f
TAKE THIS, MONSTER!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Ha-ha-ha, another impressive victory for Gaston!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Come on, {PlayerName}; make a portrait of me with my quarry! But hurry â I won't hold still for long.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Don't worry, Gaston â I've got a special contraption that can make a portrait in a blink!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I will! Make sure you watch me finish it off so you can tell everyone how heroic I am.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Not frightened, {PlayerName}? I knew you felt safe with me.
