Here we go â one <ActivityItem>Freezer of Infinite Meat</ActivityItem>, as requested!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Nicely done, LeFou!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'M NOT LEFOU!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I... Thanks Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
... Oh... right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It means that you overstate things.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It means that what you said is true and accurate.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Gaston? Hello? You okay?

TAG: Gaston_007_f
What? Why wouldn't I be?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Never mind. Let's move on.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
You could've been a little quicker. I almost died of hunger.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
I think that's an exaggeration.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I don't know the meaning of the word.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Okay, I get it Gaston. You're really hungry.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Yes. But... what does "exaggeration" MEAN?

TAG: Gaston_014_f
I do not! When I say I'm exceedingly charming and handsome, that's the truth!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
One question, Gaston... Where does the meat come from?

TAG: Gaston_018_f
I... am not sure. I was going over the plans, and there were just so many words.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Something about crystal meta-structures, the howl-o-graphic some such and atomic reconsti-something or other?

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Whatever that all is, it's not from hunting.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yeah, I didn't get that either.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Fascinating! It creates the food from nothing at a molecular level!

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Let's get the stall working!

TAG: Gaston_026_f
Enough book talk!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Excellent! Then everything I say is an exaggeration.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
I completely agree.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
You're a good sidekick.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
But you could be a little quicker. I almost died of hunger!
