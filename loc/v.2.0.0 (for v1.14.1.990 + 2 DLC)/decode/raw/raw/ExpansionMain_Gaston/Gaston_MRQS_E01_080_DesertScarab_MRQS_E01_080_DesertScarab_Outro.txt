How's it going, Gaston?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
{PlayerName}, I want to make sure you have one thing straight... Coconut LeFou is NOT some kind of companion or toy.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
I made him simply to pass the time!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
... Like someone would do with a toy?

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Don't be absurd! I'm a grown man! Toys are for children!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Never feel ashamed of having fun with toys!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
You were in a tough situation â no shame.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
It's kind of adorable, actually.

TAG: Gaston_027_f
Spoken like someone who plays with toys.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
One half down!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Excellent! I'm that much closer to boundless treasure!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Do you want to move forward by helping me find the other piece of the Scarab?

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Not now. I need to do rugged and manly things for a while first.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Dare I ask what that entails?

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Oh you know, the usual â staring out into the distance from a peak...

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Testing my mettle against the forces of nature.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
That sort of thing.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Good... luck... I guess?

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Perhaps as I gaze stoically at the landscape, I'll catch sight of the other Scarab piece!

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Takes one to know one.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
All right... I'll <Lore>check back in with you in a few hours</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_029_f
Don't try your word traps on me!

TAG: Gaston_034_f
Why do you care what I think of Coconut LeFou, anyway?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I don't. I only care what I think! But... when I got back to my encampment, it became far too clear...

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I've strayed from the Gastonian path.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
It's time for me to take up my impressive pursuits again and stop whittling like some pitiful carpenter. I must move forward!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Did you find the scabbard?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
"SCARAB," Gaston, and yes I did.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I guess I can explore a little in the meantime and see what secrets Eternity Isle might have.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
I guess I can check out the Wild Tangle in the meantime and see if I can get a lead on the Jewel of Time there...

TAG: Gaston_030_f
It WOULD be shameful if it was true.

TAG: Gaston_031_f
But it ISN'T! As ruler of Gastonia, I have no need for childish comforts.

TAG: Gaston_032_f
Uh huh. Sure.

TAG: Gaston_033_f
It's not! Ugh, why do I even bother?
