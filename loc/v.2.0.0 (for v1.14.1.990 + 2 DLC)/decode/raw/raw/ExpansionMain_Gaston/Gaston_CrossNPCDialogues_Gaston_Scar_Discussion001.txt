Stay back, fiend! I've battled creatures far larger than you.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
*sigh* Yes, well, as you don't seem to be an actual threat, what with having neither claws nor effective teeth...

TAG: Gaston_002_f
...I suppose there's no reason to threaten you. But would you kindly leave me be?

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I don't need a weapon to deal with you.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Really...? Do you plan to annoy me into submission?

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Hm. Not a bad idea...

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Oh, please...
