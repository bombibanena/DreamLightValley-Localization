McDuck, my good man, are you still the richest guy here?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Aye, that I am.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Well, I have a little venture you might be interested in.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I always have a moment to listen to a business proposition.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
A breakfast eatery that specializes in extremely large egg portions.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Perhaps, oh, I don't know... five dozen per customer.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I eat free, of course.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Curse me kilts! How am I supposed to turn a profit giving away that many eggs for free?!
