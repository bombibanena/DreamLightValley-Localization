Hey Gaston, what's new?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
{PlayerName}, I've had an amazing idea.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Great, let's hear it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Aaaand that's my cue to leave.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I've accepted that you're not an... ideal lackey.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
But that doesn't change the fact that I am in need of one.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Finally, you're going to stop trying to order me around!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sidekick, Gaston; not lackey.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
What? I never said that!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Regardless... I'm going to recruit one of the Villagers to be my sidekick!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
As long as "sidekick" is just your way of saying "friend"... I guess that's... relatively harmless.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
And you're going to help me!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Of course you want my help with this.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sure, why not?!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Any ideas who you want as your new sidekick?

TAG: Gaston_014_f
No. I need to see if they're worthy first.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
I've made a list of potential Villagers, and I need you to talk to each of them.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Interrogate them for me, and let me know if they have the qualities I require in a sidekick.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Don't judge a book by its cover, Gaston!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
All right, if it gets you out of my hair.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Happy to help!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Of course not. Unless it has pictures.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Now, I think the following Villagers could be good candidates...

TAG: Gaston_019_f
<ActivityItem>Donald</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Vanellope</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Stitch</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Minnie</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Olaf</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Big list! And a bit random...

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Well, I may need backups.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Okay, I'll talk to them, but don't get upset if they don't want to, okay?

TAG: Gaston_023_f
{PlayerName}, when have I ever gotten upset?

TAG: Gaston_024_f
You know what? I'm going to leave instead of answering that.

TAG: Gaston_025_f
Ha-ha! If I didn't know better, I'd say you don't enjoy my company.

TAG: Gaston_026_f
Excellent!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
There's a difference?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Yes. Heroes have sidekicks. Lackeys are more like servants. And NO â I'm not going to be your servant.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Well, my idea will be even more amazing the next time you come by!
