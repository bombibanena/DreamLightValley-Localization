How do you think that went, Gaston?

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Hmm, deciding will be tricky, very tricky...

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Stitch told everyone that I struggle with my badness something or other...

TAG: Gaston_007_f
But that I'm doing an excellent job managing it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Aww, that's adorable!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Oof, that's not exactly buttering you up LeFou-style.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I don't need adorable in a sidekick!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
He clearly doesn't understand that compliments are meant to make one person stand out from the rest.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
How will other people understand that I'm better than they are if Olaf compliments everyone equally?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Yeah, I see why you wouldn't be happy about that.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Gaston, I don't think you understand Olaf.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Still, he is the appropriate size for a sidekick. And he does have an interest in music.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Having a band leader for social events would be beneficial.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
What about Olaf? How'd he do?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Well, he was excellent at complimenting me!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
He informed everyone of my dedication to physical fitness...

TAG: Gaston_017_f
And he even sang about my neck!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
I feel like there's a "but" coming...

TAG: Gaston_019_f
BUT... he complimented EVERYONE!

TAG: Gaston_022_f
He was doing so well, but then... ruined it!

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Well, you still have to pick a winner. Who's it going to be?

TAG: Gaston_025_f
I... am not sure.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Gaston not being sure about something?! You feeling all right?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
It's definitely a tough choice!

TAG: Gaston_026_f
I know, I'm surprised as well.

TAG: Gaston_030_f
You have to help me, {PlayerName}. Who do you think would make the best sidekick for me?

TAG: Gaston_031_f
Hmm, tricky question.

TAG: Gaston_032_f
Quite!

TAG: Player_005_f
Okay, the best sidekick for you would be...

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
...Stitch.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
...Olaf.

TAG: Gaston_035_f
Fine. I'll go tell him the good news!

TAG: Gaston_027_f
Well, you know what I do with tough choices?

TAG: Gaston_028_f
What?

TAG: Gaston_029_f
I pass them along to someone else.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
What matters is that he doesn't understand me!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Precisely!
