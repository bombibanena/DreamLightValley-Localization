Gaston... Is this...? LEFOU?!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I... um... Oh, I was wondering where I left that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You WERE lonely out here!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
One word: Why???

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Me, lonely? Never!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
I made this LeFou... to pass the time, nothing more. Though it is an improvement on the original.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Recreating your sidekick seems like a thing a lonely person would do.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
{PlayerName}... if I had been feeling lonely, wouldn't making a LeFou out of coconuts and talking to it every day make me MORE lonely?

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
No, a coconut LeFou would have helped you.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
Actually, that does make sense.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
Honestly, when it comes to you, I have no idea.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Hardly. It didn't help at all, and I feel as marvelous as ever!

TAG: Gaston_031_f
All I've found is sand and the occasional piece of junk.

TAG: Gaston_036_f
Oh, and a chunk of an odd metal bug.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Excuse me, what?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
A metal bug? Like a... scarab?

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Yes... you're clearly doing great out here...

TAG: Gaston_046_f
Well, I'm going back to my encampment. That quicksand damaged LeFou's paint.

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Whoa, you can't be serious â what about the Jewel of Time?

TAG: Gaston_025_f
The Jewel the wizard made up, which can only be found with a vault key that likely doesn't exist? Proceed without me.

TAG: Gaston_030_f
I've been thinking... Even if there WAS treasure to be had, what does it matter? There's nothing here to spend it on, no one to impress.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Ugh! If you won't help me directly, can you at least tell me a little more about this Scarab Key you mentioned?

TAG: Gaston_021_f
*sigh* Fine... The Mirage Wizard said it's in two pieces, shaped like a Scarab, and when you put the pieces together, it will lead you to the vault.

TAG: Gaston_029_f
And?! Were you able to find any clues about it?

TAG: Gaston_038_f
I SAID "METAL BUG"!

TAG: Gaston_039_f
Do you have sand in your ears?

TAG: Gaston_041_f
Gaston... describe for me what you think a scarab is.

TAG: Gaston_042_f
You know, a scarab. Long, hollow thing you store a sword in.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I... don't even know how to respond to that.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
SCABBARD, Gaston, that's called a scabbard, not a scarab.

TAG: Gaston_043_f
A scarab is a desert beetle. Just like the metal one you found!

TAG: Gaston_044_f
... That can't be right.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
I assure you that it is.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Never mind.

TAG: Gaston_045_f
You go hang out with your... uh... Coconut LeFou. I'll handle this.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Fine. By the way, I threw the bug somewhere in <Lore>the Plains</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Probably in one of the time thingies. But since you got through those Time Rifts, I'm sure you'll find it.

TAG: Gaston_032_f
Yeah, don't worry; I've got the right tool for this. My <Lore>Hourglass should help me find it</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_040_f
No.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Of course it does. No one makes more sense than Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
That's because I'm both mysterious and dashing.

TAG: Gaston_037_f
I'd go with "confusing" and "frustrating" but let's not get sidetracked...

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Oh, LeFou here has been a... project. Keeping my mind sharp during my time in the desert.

TAG: Gaston_048_f
Thank you for finding him, {PlayerName}. Let's never speak of this again.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Well... as long as we can get back to trying to find the <Lore>vault key</Lore> for the Jewel of Time...

TAG: Gaston_022_f
You go ahead. I think "LeFou" and I will head back to my encampment now.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
His paint clearly needs refreshing after all that quicksand.
