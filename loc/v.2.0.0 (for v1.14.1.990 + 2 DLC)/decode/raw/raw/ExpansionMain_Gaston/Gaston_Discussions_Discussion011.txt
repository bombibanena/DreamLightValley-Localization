There's definitely some work to do.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Olaf follows commands well...

TAG: Gaston_002_f
But he refuses to simply sit and wait for my instructions!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Yeah, about that...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You need to ease up on Olaf.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're being way too hard on poor Olaf!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
What? But he's my sidekick!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
You're trying to be a hero, aren't you, Gaston?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Trying to be? I already am!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Then try acting like one! Olaf isn't your lackey. I wanted to find you a friend!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
You have a responsibility to treat Olaf properly.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
... That's truly important to you?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Yes!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Fine. I'll... keep that in mind.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Thank you, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Stitch has... interesting ideas about how a sidekick should behave.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's Stitch for you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What sort of ideas?

TAG: Gaston_014_f
He keeps telling me to think about my "badness levels."

TAG: Gaston_015_f
And not to let them control me.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Can you imagine it? Me? With some sort of badness level?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What a suggestion...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Yes, yes, I can imagine it.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
He'll learn soon enough.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Though I must say, the little creature is tough â I like that in a sidekick!

TAG: Gaston_019_f
All right, Gaston; I'll let you do your thing.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
But try to be open-minded! Stitch could probably teach you a thing or two about heroism.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
You should ask him about his adventures. I didn't want to find you a lackey. I wanted to find you a friend.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
That is why imagination is dangerous...
