{PlayerName}, I'm concerned. A lot of folks in this Village seem to read.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Reading is good.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll put a stop to that right away.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
It's not right! Soon they'll start getting ideas. And thinking!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You are completely un-enlightened.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe YOU should try reading more.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Why, thank you. But get on that reading thing. It could become a problem.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Ugh... What a complete waste of time.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
But perhaps if you brought me something with pictures...

TAG: Gaston_005_f
How can you say that? Soon they'll start getting ideas. And thinking!

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Good! I'm glad we had this talk.
