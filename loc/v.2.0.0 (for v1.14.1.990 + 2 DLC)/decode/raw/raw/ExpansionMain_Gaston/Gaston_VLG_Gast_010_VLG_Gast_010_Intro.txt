How are you settling in, Gaston? Need a hand with anything?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Well, I never NEED a hand...

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
But you could use one anyway?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Great, see you around!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
{PlayerName}, I promise you: Anything I decide to do, I excel at!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Glad to hear you're enjoying your time here then!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Okay, calm down.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can you succeed at being polite?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I may be settled here, but that doesn't mean I'm enjoying it.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I have to say... I'm not impressed by the community at all.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Well sure, there's always room for improvement! Is there something that would help you feel more at home?

TAG: Gaston_027_f
Most definitely.

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Appropriate adoration.

TAG: Gaston_029_f
Buckets of praise.

TAG: Gaston_030_f
And most importantly... a place for it all to happen!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Why am I not surprised...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What did you have in mind?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You need a specific place for that?!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
You understand me then! Finally!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I can see it already: a rustic hunting lodge... my latest kill roasting over the fire... and me in the middle, holding court among my admiring fans.

TAG: Gaston_035_f
Yeah, I'm not sure about the "latest kill" part, but I can help you get a lodge going!

TAG: Gaston_036_f
Usually LeFou handles this sort of thing.

TAG: Gaston_037_f
But since he's not here, I suppose you could be a substitute LeFou.

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
How kind of you...

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
How about no?

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
Perfect!

TAG: Gaston_031_f
I am kind, aren't I?

TAG: Gaston_032_f
I built a lodge ages ago in the <Lore>Wastes</Lore> â let's meet there.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
I want to show you how it looks after my time stuck in the desert.

TAG: Gaston_033_f
You're right. I'm not sure you could fill his boots. But you may still assist me.

TAG: Gaston_034_f
Ah, enthusiasm! That's just what I need!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Yes!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
There! You see! You don't appreciate me at all.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Of course. But polite is overrated.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Wait â perhaps I will give you the honor of helping me. Return quickly!
