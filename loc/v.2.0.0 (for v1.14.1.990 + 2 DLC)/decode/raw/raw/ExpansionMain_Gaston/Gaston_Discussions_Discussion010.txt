{PlayerName}, I'm looking for that large man...

TAG: Gaston_001_f
...the one covered in drawings.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Oh, you mean Maui!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I plan on challenging him to a contest of strength!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'd love to see that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That might be hard to pull off.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hate to break it to you, but he's a demigod...

TAG: Gaston_004_f
I'd love to see it too!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
But, alas, I'm unable to witness the magnificence of my own feats of daring.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Who do you think would win?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Definitely Maui.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Might be a tie!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Of course! I'm not sure why I even asked.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Regardless of who wins, that would be quite the match to watch!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Bah! Get ready to see how wrong you are.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Hmm... interesting...

TAG: Gaston_011_f
I suppose I could use a rival to keep me sharp...

TAG: Gaston_012_f
What?! You've seen my bravery with your own eyes!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I don't know what that means, and I don't care to.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
He's fought things you wouldn't believe!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Has he battled a boar in the dark of night in a frozen wood? I think not!
