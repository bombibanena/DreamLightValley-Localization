I'm well known as the greatest hunter in the world!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Wolves. Boars. I've hunted them all! Go ahead â name an animal!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Deer.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Bears.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't like hunting...

TAG: Gaston_002_f
I've hunted more deer than you can count! Their antlers are featured in my decorating.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Those thieving behemoths! They'll steal any food that's not nailed down.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
No such beast will menace the Village while I'm around!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Don't be ridiculous! What could there be not to like?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Besides, where do you think your meat comes from?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You trophy hunt.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm vegetarian.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Meat grows in refrigerators.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Well, of course I do! Antlers are my signature decoration.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Hmm, I'm not familiar with that profession.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
What are you saying? Sounds like some nonsense thing Belle's father would make.
