Aren't I the best at fishing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Did you really go fishing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uhh, sure I guess.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Of course!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Now like any hunting trip, I'll have a new trophy!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
How do you think it will look on my wall next to the fish I caught?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They'll really suit the vibe!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not my style.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
As long as they don't start singing.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Yes, well, I'll assume that's good because of course they will!

TAG: Gaston_030_f
No worries; I'll try to find the rest of the compass â maybe it will lead us to more treasure!

TAG: Gaston_031_f
Hey, I give the orders around here!

TAG: Gaston_032_f
But... yes... do that.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
So did the fishing scratch your itch for adventure?

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Actually... no.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
But I did find a piece of a compass while fishing...

TAG: Gaston_027_f
A piece of a compass? Strange...

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Yes, I had completely forgotten about it, but the memories are starting to come back...

TAG: Gaston_029_f
I found a compass ages ago. It had some sort of enchantment on it. And it was leading me to amazing treasures!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Sadly for me, the compass has broken apart since I last saw it...

TAG: Gaston_013_f
{PlayerName}... don't brag about having bad taste.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
As my sidekick, it reflects badly on me.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Do mounted fish do that here?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
No... no they do not.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maybe. I guess we'll find out.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Well, if they sing about me, all the better!
