Gaston, I found some stuff around your encampment while you were napping.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Nap?! Naps are for children!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
I had a mighty and much-deserved rest!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Whatever floats your boat.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
While you were resting, I didn't find the vault key, but I found these...

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Oh, that? Those are from... I've no idea what those are! Never seen them before!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Kinda sounds like they're yours.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
What? I, uh... don't be ridiculous. I don't play with craft... items. I hunt and do other things requiring immense strength!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
True â I can't see you doing arts and crafts.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Why the coconuts?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Of course you can't!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Now, we should search my shipwreck next!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Your what?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Nice deflection from the craft supplies.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Shipwreck! Ages ago, I left my home and took to the high seas in search of adventure.

TAG: Gaston_026_f
But my ship was blown off course during a storm and got caught in a massive tidal wave!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Thanks to my natural nautical talents and impressive physique, I survived. The wave pushed my vessel far inland to this strange desert.

TAG: Gaston_027_f
I've been ruling it ever since.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'm sorry, Gaston. It must be really rough to be stuck here.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Good thing I came over when I did!

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Stuck? I'm not stuck. I'm the ruler of Gastonia!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
You weren't lonely at all?

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Well Iâ Look here, {PlayerName}! All this talk of feelings is a waste of time. We must continue my quest!

TAG: Gaston_032_f
My shipwreck is in <Lore>the Wastes</Lore>, but I can't get through those blasted Time Rifts!

TAG: Gaston_033_f
They suddenly showed up and got in my way.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
No problem â already took care of it. The path to the Wastes is clear!

TAG: Gaston_035_f
Then, what are we waiting for? I'm sure you'll be impressed by my strength and physique as we go!

TAG: Gaston_000_f
I feel like you're losing sight of the impending doom and destruction of the entire Island here.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Not seeing how that's my problem â hurry up!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
I can handle those Time Rifts â leave it to me. I'll just need to get some more <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> for my Hourglass.

TAG: Gaston_034_f
Fine, you go handle that, and I'll <Lore>meet you there when you open the way</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_029_f
No, no... I was going to free myself RIGHT before you appeared and helped.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
I have no idea what you're talking about.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
... Why NOT coconuts?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
No. I leave making boats float to the shipwrights.
