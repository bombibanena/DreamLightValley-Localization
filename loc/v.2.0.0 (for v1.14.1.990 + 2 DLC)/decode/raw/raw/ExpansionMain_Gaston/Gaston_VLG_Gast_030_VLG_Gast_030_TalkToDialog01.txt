TAG: Gaston_007_f
Well, that was, uhh...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...a little awkward?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...hilarious?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Never mind that. We must move forward!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
No regrets, no second thoughts â that's the Gastonian Experience!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Now, {PlayerName}, are you ready to build muscles like me?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yeah!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Uhhh, I guess.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Can I say "no"?

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Excellent!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
You've seen Merlin's legs, haven't you? Good for walking maybe, but you need powerful legs to strut impressively!

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Are you saying... never skip leg day?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Hmmm, I like the sound of that. Did you come up with that yourself?

TAG: Player_010_choice_000_f
Sure did!

TAG: Player_010_choice_001_f
Nah.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Actually... I think I remember inventing that ages ago.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
You must have heard me say it.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Uh, no, I'm pretty sureâ

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Enough talk. We must exercise!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Okay, big gains, here we come!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Start on the barbell â I'll supervise.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
The neck.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
The what?!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Never skip neck day?

TAG: Gaston_021_f
You think a neck like mine comes naturally? No, you've got to work for it!

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Okay, what do I do?

TAG: Gaston_024_f
This is the core of the Gastonian method. I'll ask you some questions, and you must answer the way I would.

TAG: Gaston_025_f
First question... Someone offers you a bunch of vegetables â what do you say?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
No, thanks. I just ate.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
That sounds lovely, thank you!

TAG: Gaston_026_f
That's a start, but you must also shake your head with great emphasis.

TAG: Gaston_030_f
Okay, try me again.

TAG: Gaston_031_f
{PlayerName}... would you like a book?

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
NO!

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
Sure!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
So, how do you feel, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Gaston_032_f
That's it!

TAG: Gaston_036_f
Feel your neck getting stronger! Now, here's the last one.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Tired...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
SWOLE!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Kinda the same?

TAG: Gaston_037_f
{PlayerName}... do you enjoy thinking about the consequences of your actions?

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
Sure.

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
NO!

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Well, we're not done yet! Now comes the most important part.

TAG: Gaston_038_f
Oh, wait... uhâ

TAG: Gaston_039_f
NO!

TAG: Gaston_040_f
Yes! Your neck is getting thicker by the minute.

TAG: Player_008_choice_000_f
Thank you?

TAG: Player_008_choice_001_f
I need a shower now.

TAG: Gaston_041_f
Wrong! I DESERVE compliments. There's no reason to thank anyone for them.

TAG: Gaston_044_f
So what now?

TAG: Gaston_045_f
Well, now that your neck is impressively thick...

TAG: Player_009_choice_000_f
Oh yeah, it is.

TAG: Player_009_choice_001_f
Not something I ever expected to hear.

TAG: Gaston_046_f
We need to show the other Villagers.

TAG: Gaston_047_f
How are you at drawing?

TAG: Gaston_048_f
What if I take some pictures instead? It's like making an instant painting. Should be faster than drawing a bunch of sketches.

TAG: Gaston_049_f
Not wasting time on boring things... Now you're thinking like me!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Three pictures should do it.

TAG: Gaston_042_f
That means it's working!

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I only think about my muscle gains when looking in the mirror!

TAG: Gaston_033_f
...

TAG: Gaston_034_f
Oh, uh... no!

TAG: Gaston_035_f
That's it!

TAG: Gaston_027_f
{PlayerName}, haven't you been paying attention?! Is this a joke to you?

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
Absolutely.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
Not at all!

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Hmm... Disrespect, that is Gastonian.

TAG: Gaston_029_f
Now, you must find the answer I'd give and then shake your head emphatically.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Exactly!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I want enthusiasm, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Only if you're giving up on the Gastonian Experience.
