So... thirsty...

TAG: Gaston_026_f
You! Giant tankard of water, come over here!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You are SEVERELY dehydrated.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not a tankard; I'm a person.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The sun has shriveled you like a raisin.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
That had better mean devastatingly handsome!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Snap? Snap peas? Oh, I'd even eat a vegetable right now!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Vegetables? How long have you been out here?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Wow, this is worse than I thought.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I need answers!

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Relax, okay? My name's {PlayerName}. I'm here to help you.

TAG: Gaston_027_f
You're... real? HA! You're real!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Wait â I don't need help â you need MY help! And I'll only help for water... or jewels. That strange Mirage Wizard needs a jewel...

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Jewel?! Gaston, I'm looking for something called a Jewel of Time! Do you know where it is?

TAG: Gaston_011_f
No... or... maybe... I can't recall. But I do know the answer lies at the bottom of a cold, refreshing drink!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Gaston, I know you're thirsty, and I'm going to help you with that. But I need your help, too. All of Eternity Isle is at stake.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
You need to snap out of it!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Can't talk... too parched! I'm wasting away!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
If only I had some of those <Lore>green spiky leaves</Lore>...

TAG: Gaston_021_f
You know the ones. Tastier than a cactus and just as full of water!

TAG: Gaston_022_f
I have no idea what you're taking about, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Oh, and to finish off the meal...

TAG: Gaston_024_f
One of those <Lore>flexing, spider-like creatures that live in quicksand</Lore> and some <Lore>little brown sweet raisin things</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_025_f
Okay, clearly <Lore>I need to help YOU first if I'm to have any hope of finding the Jewel of Time</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
I'll be back with the <Lore>food you asked for</Lore>. Just hang on.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not imagining things. I've never imagined a thing in my life!

TAG: Gaston_006_f
No! No! Not my intimidating muscles! You take that back!
