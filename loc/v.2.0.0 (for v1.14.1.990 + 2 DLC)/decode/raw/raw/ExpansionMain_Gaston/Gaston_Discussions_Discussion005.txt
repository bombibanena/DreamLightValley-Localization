Hmm... there's something off about this place.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
I can't quite put my finger on it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is it the Villagers?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is it the dÃ©cor?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're wrong; this place is perfect.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
No... though none of them are as interesting as me...

TAG: Gaston_003_f
It's something else.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Please, the other Villagers are at least as interesting as you.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I've got it! It's the terrible lack of decorations.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Picture this: antlers.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Everywhere. On every wall. Wouldn't that be magnificent?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
... I'm picturing it, and it's not my vibe.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'll get right on it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
No. I refuse.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Not yet, perhaps. But I'm sure you'll see the glory in it soon.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I knew you'd understand!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
A choice you're sure to regret.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Yes, that's it!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
What's wrong with it? I think it looks rather nice here...

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Nice, perhaps. But you want bold! Impressive!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
No, it's not! I'll tell you about perfect.
