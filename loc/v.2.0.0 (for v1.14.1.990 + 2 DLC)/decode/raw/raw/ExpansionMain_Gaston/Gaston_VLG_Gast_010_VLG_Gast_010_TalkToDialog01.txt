Good thing I was here â with your puny muscles, it would have taken you weeks to move in all the new furnishings and fix the exterior!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
My muscles aren't puny...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm just happy you helped at all!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Oh Le-{PlayerName}... you always know how to make me laugh!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Aargh... my stomach!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
*grumble-grumble-GROOOAAANNNN*

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Excuse me, that was your STOMACH?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Gaston, did you eat some sort of lion?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
THE LODGE IS COLLAPSING! RUN!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
My stomach is complaining.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
It's been a good hour since I last ate.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Let's swing by Chez Remy! The food there is amazing.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
If you can call it food... not a steak or cut of venison in sight!

TAG: Gaston_019_f
I've got a better idea.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Let's hear it!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Of course you do...

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Before the Forgetting, I was on the trail of a mythical relic of legend.

TAG: Gaston_026_f
Hmm, well I'll see what I can do.

TAG: Gaston_027_f
Excellent. Don't take too long.

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Otherwise... I may be forced to eat a vegetable.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Some sort of enchanted chest full of delicious cuts of meat.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
... Like an Enchanted Meat Freezer?

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Perhaps. I was never sure what that was.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Legend has it that it was destroyed long ago in some sort of magical calamity. Pieces of it were scattered around the area that grew into the Wild Tangle. I bet they're still there!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I found these plans for it by some of those glowing ruins â whoever came up with this is a far more useful inventor than Belle's father!

TAG: Gaston_025_f
But there's some sort of barrier around the pieces â I would get close and then... things would become strange. I think they might be lost in time.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Now, I've got big plans for this creation. If you can help me put it back together with that Hourglass of yours, then I can open a stall to supply meat to everyone!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
No... but that sounds like an excellent idea!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Nonsense!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Well, we have a deadline!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
... We do?
