Here we are â the capital of Gastonia!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Great, can we PLEASE focus now? What are you doing here in the Glittering Dunes... or Gastonia?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Well, if you were familiar with heroism, you'd know that heroes always go on quests.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh, I'm quite familiar with quests.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure, go on.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Strange; you don't look like a hero to me.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Anyway... back home, whenever I was out doing heroic deeds, my lackey LeFou was always by my side...

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Lackey? This LeFou sounds more like your sidekick.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Sidekick? LeFou can be bothersome, but I've never felt the need to kick him in the side. That might hurt my toe.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
No no, a sidekick is like...

TAG: Gaston_023_f
A friend that helps you out with stuff. They tend to be smaller and very emotionally involved with your success.

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Oh! Then... yes, LeFou is that!

TAG: Gaston_025_f
LeFou... my sidekick. I like it! And now YOU can play that part for me on my quest!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What quest is that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think I have hero potential!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
How about you be MY sidekick?

TAG: Gaston_007_f
My quest for the Mirage Wizard!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Have you met him? Carries a snake-headed staff, uses too many long words, a little see-through...

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Oh, you're talking about Jafar!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Is that his name? "Mirage Wizard" is better.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I started seeing him after I established Gastonia. He asked that I find something called the <ActivityItem>Jewel of Time</ActivityItem> for him. Of course, I never work for free.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
So, he said this "Jewel of Time" was hidden inside a vault filled with treasure, and that I could have all but that Jewel.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
So the <Lore>Jewel of Time</Lore> is in that vault!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I wish Jafar had told me about this...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
This is actually helpful...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
How do we get into the vault?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
There's one problem... We must <Lore>find the key to the vault first</Lore> and... the key refuses to be found anywhere!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Maybe we should check everywhere you looked again. Retrace your steps? Two pairs of eyes are better than one.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Hmm... I'm thinking... *gasp* I know! We'll retrace my steps! You can start by checking around this camp while I rest.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Ugh! Youâ Iâ ... Fine! I'll take a look around and <Lore>see if I can find anything unusual</Lore>...

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Ha-ha-ha! You're hilarious... and wrong. How you remind me of LeFou.

TAG: Gaston_026_f
Back on task. What "quest" were you on?

TAG: Gaston_016_f
You JUST said a sidekick is SMALLER than the hero â and you're MUCH smaller than me.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
WOW. You actually put something together with logic. GOOD ONE.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Impressive, I know. Everything about me is.
