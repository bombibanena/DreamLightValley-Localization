Well, you've tested your two candidates â what do you think about the results?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
*sigh* I'm... disappointed.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, I saw that coming.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What?! Why?

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Stitch did bring me a heroic amount of eggs. And the coconut cake was quite good.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I would love to receive flowers from Olaf!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Okay, I get your point.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
But that coffee was terrible! Why would he drink that?!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I think he likes the energy boost it gives him.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
How unnecessary. I get all my energy from my incredible strength of will.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
So you're going with Olaf, then?

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Olaf... but he...

TAG: Gaston_013_f
He brought me flowers!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
And?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
And... I asked him to conquer nature, and he brought me flowers!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
How sad for you.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
So what do you want to do?

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Well, they both have potential, so I'll need to give them another test...

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Extolling my virtues during a party!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Of course that's the final test...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
A party? Count me in!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
We'll need a proper setting to truly see their skill â make me a <ActivityItem>Gastonian Appreciation Stage</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Excuse me, what?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Exactly what I said, {PlayerName} â a stage where people can hoist me on their shoulders and loudly proclaim how amazing I am!

TAG: Gaston_021_f
You'll need <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem>, and those things you call <ActivityItem>Plastic Scraps</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Set that up and I'll inform the candidates about the next test and send out invitations to the event.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
All right, I'll take care of that next.
