Ooh...

TAG: EVE_002_f
What... is this place? It's in ruins.

TAG: EVE_003_f
Oh...

TAG: EVE_004_f
EVE. WALLÂ·E...

TAG: EVE_005_f
Plants.

TAG: EVE_006_f
Wait, was it like a secret spot you shared with WALLÂ·E? A secret garden?

TAG: EVE_007_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: Player_000_f
I think...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...it's pretty cute!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...it needs some work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...I've seen junkyards in a better state.

TAG: EVE_008_f
Hmm...

TAG: EVE_017_f
With all those time anomalies, maybe they're still around Ancient's Landing, hidden in the <ActivityItem>Swirling Sands</ActivityItem>. I'll go look for them.

TAG: EVE_000_f
And I'll even add some <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem> and maybe some <ActivityItem>Jade</ActivityItem> for decoration...

TAG: EVE_018_f
Whooo-hooo!

TAG: EVE_011_f
Let's make it good as new.

TAG: EVE_012_f
Whoo!

TAG: EVE_013_f
I can see what's left of the imprint of something round like a <ActivityItem>Trashcan</ActivityItem>... Weird.

TAG: EVE_014_f
Plants! WALLÂ·E!

TAG: EVE_015_f
Oh that's right. WALLÂ·E sometimes uses <ActivityItem>Trashcans</ActivityItem> as planters.

TAG: EVE_019_f
WALLÂ·E...

TAG: EVE_020_f
And there seems to have been a <ActivityItem>Blanket</ActivityItem> here at some point too.

TAG: EVE_016_f
*sigh*

TAG: EVE_009_f
Uh...

TAG: EVE_010_f
Oh.
