Hmm... something bothering you, EVE?

TAG: EVE_001_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_024_f
Hmm... I'll try to figure out what's wrong.

TAG: EVE_002_f
Hmm...

TAG: Player_001_f
Are you feeling...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...scared?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...anxious?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...sad?

TAG: EVE_004_f
Directive! Directive!

TAG: EVE_005_f
I'll start with <Lore>that giant tree with the hanging lanterns near the Well</Lore>.

TAG: EVE_019_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_020_f
And I'll bet <Lore>the boat I used to get to Eternity Isle</Lore> is making you a little nervous too, huh? I'll scan that to make sure it's safe!

TAG: EVE_021_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_016_f
Hmm... those <Lore>giant statue faces</Lore> poking out everywhere around Ancient's Landing seem a little scary.

TAG: EVE_017_f
I'll start by <Lore>taking a picture of the one in the tunnel between the Docks and the Courtyard</Lore>...

TAG: EVE_018_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_022_f
Oh, is that <Lore>strange doorway between the two waterfalls</Lore> making you a bit nervous too? Don't worry. I'll scan that too.

TAG: EVE_023_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_008_f
Oh, EVE... are you having trouble relaxing? Is that it?

TAG: EVE_009_f
*sigh* Directive...

TAG: EVE_010_f
You were looking out for dangers for so long that now you don't know how to stop. I know how it is.

TAG: EVE_011_f
But hey... you're not alone here anymore. You've got me!

TAG: EVE_012_f
Oh.

TAG: EVE_013_f
Why don't I use my own "scanner"... my Camera... to make sure there are no dangers so you won't have to worry?

TAG: EVE_014_f
Huh?

TAG: EVE_015_f
I'll <Lore>take pictures of any possible dangers around the Docks</Lore> to show you they're not a threat.

TAG: EVE_006_f
No!

TAG: EVE_007_f
Classified!
