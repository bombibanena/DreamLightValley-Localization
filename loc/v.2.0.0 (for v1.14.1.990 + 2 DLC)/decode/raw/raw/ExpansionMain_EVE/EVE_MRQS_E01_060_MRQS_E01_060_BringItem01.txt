Oh!

TAG: EVE_000_f
I hope this works because this costume REALLY doesn't fit very well.

TAG: EVE_001_f
Hmm...

TAG: EVE_003_f
You're starting to remember me, aren't you?

TAG: EVE_023_f
You kept this, all this time? You want me to <Lore>PROVE that I'm really your old friend by cooking this</Lore>?

TAG: EVE_024_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_025_f
This meal sounds kind of ridiculous... it's like something a little kid would make for a robot...

TAG: EVE_026_f
But okay. I think I can <Lore>find all the Ingredients around here and cook it for you</Lore>.

TAG: EVE_005_f
Hmmm...

TAG: EVE_006_f
...

TAG: EVE_007_f
Uh...

TAG: EVE_019_f
What's this...?

TAG: EVE_020_f
Oh... it's a recipe!

TAG: EVE_021_f
*digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_022_f
But you don't even eat... Wait a second. It's <Lore>a recipe for the meal that I saw in the Memory</Lore>!

TAG: EVE_034_f
Now that I've opened Goofy's Stall, I bet I could even <Lore>get some of these Ingredients from Goofy</Lore>.

TAG: EVE_035_f
I should see about <Lore>opening up Goofy's Stall</Lore> here for some of these Ingredients.

TAG: EVE_004_f
Do I remind you of somebody...? An old friend...?
