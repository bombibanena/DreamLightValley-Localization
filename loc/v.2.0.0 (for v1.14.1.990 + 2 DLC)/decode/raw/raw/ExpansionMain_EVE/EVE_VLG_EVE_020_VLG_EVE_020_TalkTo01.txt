Plants!

TAG: EVE_002_f
How did this happen? Did you use your laser cannon on the plants?

TAG: EVE_003_f
*frantic digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_004_f
Why?!

TAG: EVE_005_f
Directive. Plants.

TAG: Player_000_f
That's not how...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...you give plants some sunlight.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...you warm plants up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...you get rid of the weeds.

TAG: EVE_006_f
*sigh*

TAG: EVE_007_f
I'm sure we can fix that.

TAG: EVE_008_f
Phew.

TAG: EVE_009_f
I think we can make the place even nicer.

TAG: EVE_010_f
Ooooh?

TAG: EVE_011_f
And I know who to ask for help. You go fetch some new plants, and I'll go see Mirabel.
