EVE... *sigh* Directive?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Anything you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'm busy. But we'll talk later!

TAG: EVE_002_f
It must be a little weird for you, not having anything to do after guarding the Hourglass for so long.

TAG: EVE_004_f
*frantic digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_005_f
Directive!

TAG: EVE_008_f
Okay, you sound a little stressed. Let's do something fun first.

TAG: Player_001_f
There are lots of <ActivityItem>Monkeys</ActivityItem> around Ancient's Landing. Maybe we could feed some of them?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They're so funny and cute.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It could be your new directive.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
No laser cannon.

TAG: EVE_010_f
Oh!

TAG: EVE_000_f
Hmmm... Those monkeys probably only eat certain things. I think I'll need to whip up something worthy of at least <ActivityItem>3 Stars</ActivityItem>.

TAG: EVE_006_f
Maybe they'd like a nice banana-based dessert...

TAG: EVE_009_f
Directive!

TAG: EVE_011_f
Oh.

TAG: EVE_003_f
Oh...
