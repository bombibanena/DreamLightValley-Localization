Directive: Plant!

Call me the carnivorous plant tamer!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll take great care of it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Let's hope it doesn't eat me while I sleep.

TAG: EVE_013_f
Go give this to the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Cobra Lily</ActivityItem>, and let's hope it likes that.

TAG: EVE_014_f
Plant! Plant!

TAG: EVE_003_f
Yes! It worked!

TAG: EVE_001_f
Directive!

TAG: EVE_002_f
Wait... Are you giving me a sprout from a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Cobra Lily</ActivityItem>?

TAG: EVE_006_f
Whoo-hoo!

TAG: EVE_016_f
Whoa!

TAG: EVE_007_f
What's next for you? Going back to helping WALLÂ·E?

TAG: EVE_008_f
... *sigh*

TAG: EVE_015_f
You don't seem too thrilled about going back to gardening. Maybe what you need is a directive that's a bit more you...

TAG: EVE_010_f
Oh?

TAG: EVE_011_f
Take the time to think about it. There's no hurry.

TAG: EVE_012_f
Hmm...

TAG: EVE_017_f
Directive!

TAG: EVE_018_f
No!
