Hola, {PlayerName}! I've been having SO much fun exploring Eternity Isle!

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Anything you need my help with?

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
You've met EVE, right?

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
I have! She's so cute with WALLÂ·E.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Well, EVE accidentally incinerated their plants...

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Whoa. That's not good.

TAG: Player_001_f
So while she replaces the plants, I wanted to add something to their secret garden. Something...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...super cute, just like EVE and WALLÂ·E.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...meaningful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...that she can't destroy so easily.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Well, you're in luck... because before the Forgetting...

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
...you had a project like that. You wanted to create a <ActivityItem>Stone Canvas</ActivityItem> where EVE could use her laser to create art.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
...you asked me for help, and I've kept all the plans we made together.

TAG: Mirabel_016_f
Do you remember the materials?

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
Let me think...

TAG: Mirabel_014_f
We were gonna use <ActivityItem>Quartz</ActivityItem> and then something you called <ActivityItem>Plastic</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Mirabel_015_f
Oh, and <ActivityItem>Ancient Gemstones</ActivityItem> too. You had to search for them around here using your Hourglass then you asked EVE to melt them.

TAG: Mirabel_000_f
I remember they were supposed to be around Ancient's Landing.

TAG: Mirabel_017_f
Okay... I think I need to talk about it with EVE, first. Thanks a lot, Mirabel.

TAG: Mirabel_018_f
Anytime, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
The Old Ruler had a project like that. They wanted to create a <ActivityItem>Stone Canvas</ActivityItem> where EVE could use her laser to create art.
