Ah, {PlayerName}. Just who I was thinking of. By my estimations, you're doing a rather poor job ruling over this Valley.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Why, it looks to me like the sky is falling in.

TAG: Scar_007_f
Are you sure you wouldn't be happier with someone more cunning in charge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Nice try, Scar.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll think about it. But you have to help me first.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Hm... someone like Mufasa, you mean?

TAG: Scar_008_f
I've no idea what you mean.

TAG: Scar_013_f
But if you haven't come here to ask me to reign over the Valley... then what DO you want?

TAG: Scar_015_f
I found something in your cave. I think it used to belong to the Forgotten.

TAG: Scar_016_f
It might be the key to stopping the Forgotten's plans. Do you know the story behind it?

TAG: Scar_017_f
...

TAG: Scar_018_f
No. I've never seen it before.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Are you sure?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe the Forgetting's gotten to you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Why do I get the vibe that you're lying?

TAG: Scar_019_f
Positively.

TAG: Scar_022_f
Besides, why would I want to remember such a... such a hideous, charmless image of me.

TAG: Scar_023_f
Aha! So you admit it's a drawing of YOU!

TAG: Scar_024_f
...

TAG: Scar_025_f
Please, Scar. This might be the only way to stop the Forgotten and save the Valley.

TAG: Scar_001_f
*sigh* ... Fine. If I must, to ensure I have a kingdom left to rule over, then... I'll tell you.

TAG: Scar_002_f
And... I suppose you are the closest thing I have to a... well, to someone I tolerate.

TAG: Scar_028_f
You made this for me, {PlayerName}. When you were just a cub.

TAG: Scar_029_f
It hardly captures my likeness. But, I admit I found it rather... nice... to receive a gift. Even such a pitiful one.

TAG: Scar_030_f
I've kept it ever since.

TAG: Scar_031_f
Thanks, Scar. Your story might help me stop the Forgotten.

TAG: Scar_032_f
Do have a bit of mercy for the Forgotten.

TAG: Scar_033_f
Imagine what they must think, watching you ruling over all that the light touches while they are consigned to the shadows.

TAG: Scar_034_f
I know all too well how that feels.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Whatever I know about that thing... I'd sooner take it to the grave than tell you.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Look... maybe you don't trust me enough to tell me yet.

TAG: Scar_026_f
But sooner or later, Scar... I'll show you that I'm your friend. You'll tell me.

TAG: Scar_027_f
I highly doubt it.

TAG: Scar_020_f
Hardly. I recall far too much for that to have happened.

TAG: Scar_021_f
I have absolutely no idea.

TAG: Scar_009_f
Ugh. Yet again, I'm expected to do all the work with none of the reward.

TAG: Scar_014_f
What do you want?

TAG: Scar_010_f
NEVER speak that name in my presence!

TAG: Scar_011_f
Er, right... sorry.

TAG: Scar_012_f
Well, if you haven't come all this way just to insult me... what do you want?
