Ah, you can feel it, can't you?

TAG: Scar_002_f
Whatever that monstrosity is... its power has begun to wane.

TAG: Scar_003_f
But there is still more work to do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What should I do next?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't know about this...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This better be worth it...

TAG: Scar_004_f
You know, I have an idea...

TAG: Scar_007_f
I'm sure you've noticed all the strange weeds sprouting up?

TAG: Scar_008_f
The Night Thorns, you mean?

TAG: Scar_009_f
Ugh. Yes. If we must use that windbag's name for them.

TAG: Scar_010_f
Regardless of the moniker, I rather like them, don't you? Though they do seem to sap the life out of everything around them.

TAG: Scar_011_f
Wanting to know more, I dug where you would expect to see seeds, and instead I found these small bits of darkness. I suppose you could <Lore>plant them and see what happens</Lore>...

TAG: Scar_012_f
Try near the Pillar itself... or the entrance to those caverns over there... or that Dreamlight Tree that Simba's so fond of. I'll be waiting near my den when you've finished the task.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Oh, but we've already come so far. There's only a small bit left to do.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Trust me. It will be. There's only one more thing you need to do...
