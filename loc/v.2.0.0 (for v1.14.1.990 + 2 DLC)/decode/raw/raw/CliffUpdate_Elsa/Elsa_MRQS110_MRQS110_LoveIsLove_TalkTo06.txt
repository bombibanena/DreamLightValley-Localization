Hello, {PlayerName}. Did your Watering Can uncover anything?

TAG: Elsa_001_f
I saw the Forgotten taking the Orb from the Pillar.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
Oh... Well, I've spent a lot of time talking to Merlin about the magic in this Village.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
He told me that the Pillars have protective charms on them to keep Dark Magic at bay.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Maybe the Forgotten wanted to try using more dangerous kinds of magic, and the Pillar's protective aura was stopping that.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
Elsa, there's something I need to tell you. The Forgotten... they're a part of me. Some kind of splinter of myself that I left behind.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
I see... Well, I know that magic can do things like that. Olaf is a part of me. And he's sweet and kind. But so is Marshmallow, a much larger snowman I created. He's... Let's just say he's very protective.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
So if the Forgotten wanted to mess with Dark Magic... does that mean I did too?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I would never mess with Dark Magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's the only thing that makes sense.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It definitely sounds like something I would do.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
Maybe it's not about Dark Magic. Maybe it's about... letting go.

TAG: Elsa_017_f
Then I think you'll find the rest of your answers inside.

TAG: Elsa_018_f
I'll go <Lore>see if there are any more memories inside the secret chamber</Lore>.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Maybe that's the part of yourself that the Forgotten represents. The part that can't let go of something.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
But... this would mean that the blizzard, the Forgetting... Could all of this be my fault?

TAG: Elsa_011_f
What? No, {PlayerName}... this isn't your fault.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
Trust me. When it comes to starting magical blizzards that threaten to swallow up everything and everyone I love...

TAG: Elsa_013_f
...I've got a little experience. Magic and emotions can make unintended things happen. The more you know about your magic, the more you'll be able to control it.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
What matters now is that you're here, trying to fix this.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
And I guess now we're one step closer to doing that.

TAG: Elsa_016_f
In the memory, it looked like Olaf saw the Forgotten running off with the Orb, and he followed them to the secret chamber.

TAG: Elsa_019_f
Just because you WANT to do something doesn't mean that you would ever do it.

TAG: Elsa_020_f
Well, you do seem to be a curious person. Sometimes things call to you, and you just have to follow.

TAG: Elsa_021_f
Maybe that's the part of yourself that the Forgotten represents. All that curiosity.

TAG: Elsa_022_f
But wait. That's not all.

TAG: Elsa_023_f
Elsa, the Forgotten looked just like... like...

TAG: Elsa_024_f
...me.

TAG: Elsa_025_f
... Like you?

TAG: Elsa_026_f
That's strange... Is it possible that the Forgotten is some part of yourself that you left behind?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A part of myself...? How?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Elsa... is this all my fault?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We have to fix this.

TAG: Elsa_027_f
Well, I know that magic can make things like that happen. Olaf is a part of me. And he's sweet and kind.

TAG: Elsa_028_f
But so is Marshmallow, a much larger snowman I created. He's... Let's just say he's very protective.

TAG: Elsa_029_f
Maybe the Forgotten is some piece of yourself that you need to find a way to understand.

TAG: Elsa_030_f
What? No, {PlayerName}... this isn't your fault.

TAG: Elsa_031_f
Trust me. When it comes to starting magical blizzards that threaten to swallow up everything and everyone I love...

TAG: Elsa_032_f
...I've got a little experience. Magic and emotions can make unintended things happen. The more you know about your magic, the more you'll be able to control it.

TAG: Elsa_033_f
Yes. And I know you're the one who can do that, {PlayerName}.
