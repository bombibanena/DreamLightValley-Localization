Greetings, {PlayerName}. How can I help?

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Hi, Buzz. Do you know Timon?

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Affirmative. I've seen him scurrying around the Valley.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
He seems... skittish.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He's just adjusting to Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think he's funny!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Skittish is a bit of an understatement.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
That's understandable.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
This place can be a bit daunting when you first arrive.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Anyway, he's currently making a slideshow presentation and we need a recording device for his narration. Do you have anything we can use?

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Unfortunately, no.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
I did lose some <ActivityItem>Batteries</ActivityItem> in the river in the Forest of Valor recently. You might try fishing them out of there. That way, when you find your device, you can power it up.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
I also saw some <ActivityItem>Electronic Components</ActivityItem> floating there, too.

TAG: Buzz_016_f
Great! I'll go <Lore>fish in the Forest of Valor</Lore>! Thanks, Buzz.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Yes, he is. Quite amusing.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
I can't disagree. He almost reminds me of my good friend Rex.
