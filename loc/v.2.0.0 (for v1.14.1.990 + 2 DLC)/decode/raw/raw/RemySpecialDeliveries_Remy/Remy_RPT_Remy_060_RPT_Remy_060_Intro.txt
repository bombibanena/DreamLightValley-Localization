Hey, {PlayerName}! I've got another cooking challenge for you.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Today's customer is Stitch!

TAG: Remy_003_f
He's REALLY hungry, so this one's going to be tough, even for you.

TAG: Remy_004_f
He wants <Lore>five orders of French Fries, five Fish Sandwiches, five Boba Teas, five Coconut Cakes, and five cups of Coffee</Lore>.

TAG: Remy_017_f
Oof. That made me tired just SAYING it. But Stitch said he has something "awesome" for you if you get it all.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It sounds like a challenge... but I'll do it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Nuh uh. No way. That's too much.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.

TAG: Remy_007_f
And remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.

TAG: Remy_018_f
Okay, well, Stitch had a couple of other orders too. Let me give you one of those instead.

TAG: Remy_010_f
He wants a whole bunch of <ActivityItem>Seafood Meals</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_035_f
Wonder why he's got such a craving for seafood all of a sudden...?

TAG: Remy_005_f
What do you say? Are you up to the challenge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Hey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Remember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.

TAG: Remy_013_f
He wants you to bring him some <ActivityItem>Gingerbread Houses</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_014_f
Must be a gift for someone.

TAG: Remy_015_f
{PlayerName}! Are you ready for another special delivery order?

TAG: Remy_016_f
Hey {PlayerName}! I've got another Chez Remy Mobile order for you.
