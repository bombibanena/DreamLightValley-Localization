Whoa! Did you see that, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Remy_001_f
When you opened up the menu, all these memories started rushing back!

Chez Remy used to have a whole seating area around it. With tons of tables and chairs and an incredible statue!

TAG: Remy_009_f
I KNEW it! I knew something was missing from the restaurant.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That seating area looked amazing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Looks like a lot of work to rebuild...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What happened to all that stuff?

TAG: Remy_003_f
It was!

TAG: Remy_006_f
I remember it was all made out of a special, extra shiny and durable metal called <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Mr. McDuck helped me order it. But it cost a whole lot of Star Coins.

TAG: Remy_008_f
*gasp* That's what we can do for the cooking challenges!

TAG: Remy_010_f
Chez Remy won't be able to make enough Star Coins to make something as impressive as that seating area by just serving folks in the restaurant...

TAG: Remy_011_f
... We need to start taking mobile orders!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Ooh! Great idea.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds like this'll be tough.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I hope I'll get tips for this...

TAG: Remy_012_f
Thanks! My cooking may be based in tradition, but I'm all about innovation, too.

TAG: Remy_015_f
Okay, we need to start by getting the word out. Why don't you make some free sample deliveries around the Village?

TAG: Remy_016_f
And remember: This is a challenge of all your culinary skills. So you'll have to figure out the recipes yourself. Good luck!

TAG: Remy_013_f
Tough, but TOTALLY worth it.

TAG: Remy_014_f
Don't worry. I'll definitely make sure your success gets rewarded.

TAG: Remy_004_f
It's definitely a long-term project. But hey, if a rat like me can open up a top-notch Parisian restaurant, I know we can do this.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Good question.
