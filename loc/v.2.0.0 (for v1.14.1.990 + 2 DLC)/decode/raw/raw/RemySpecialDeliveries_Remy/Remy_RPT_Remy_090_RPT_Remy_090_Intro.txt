Hey, {PlayerName}! I'd love to give you a special delivery order today, but I could use your help with something for the restaurant instead.

TAG: Remy_002_f
My oven has called it quits! And on a day when everyone in the Valley's ordering pizza.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Could you find me some <ActivityItem>Tinkering Parts</ActivityItem> to fix it?

TAG: Remy_006_f
I'll still make sure you get some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> for helping me out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Great! Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Remy_008_f
I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you once you're done.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Hey, no worries. I'll try to get by until the problem's fixed.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Though, if you help me out, I'll be able to order more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> so you can build more great things for the Village.

TAG: Remy_011_f
It occurred to me that the Village is starting to have a lot of couples in it. Couples who'd like a romantic table at the restaurant for dates.

TAG: Remy_012_f
So, I thought that if you got me some flowers, I could put them out for special occasions. But I'll need a lot of flowers.

TAG: Remy_014_f
I'm trying to buy a new wood-burning oven from Scrooge McDuck. He's asking for a whole lot of Star Coins to order one.

TAG: Remy_015_f
But he said that if we could bring him some gems from around the Valley, he'd cut me a big discount. Think you could help me get those?

TAG: Remy_016_f
When I was getting something off a shelf the other day, I accidentally knocked over a bunch of my spices, and the jars shattered.

TAG: Remy_017_f
Could you get me some new <ActivityItem>Empty Vials</ActivityItem>? I need one for paprika, oregano, sage, rosemary, thyme... so five ought to do.

TAG: Remy_018_f
I just got this incredible new wood-burning oven!

TAG: Remy_019_f
But it goes through a LOT of wood really fast.

TAG: Remy_020_f
I'd gather it myself, but for me lugging one piece of wood back to Chez Remy is practically my whole day. Think you could help?

TAG: Remy_025_f
I'm running pretty low on fish, and I'd love to try some new varieties.

TAG: Remy_026_f
Could you get me some? I've got the perfect recipes ready to go!

TAG: Remy_027_f
I was talking to Merlin, and he had an interesting suggestion for me...

TAG: Remy_028_f
He said I might be able to distill <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> into a magical spice.

TAG: Remy_029_f
But I don't really know how to find those, and Merlin's using all of his for his experiments. Could you find some for me?

TAG: Remy_030_f
I'm tryin' to start a compost heap, but I need better soil.

TAG: Remy_031_f
I noticed that sometimes when you garden, <ActivityItem>Rich Soil</ActivityItem> turns up. That stuff would be perfect!

TAG: Remy_032_f
Next time you find some, could you bring it over?
