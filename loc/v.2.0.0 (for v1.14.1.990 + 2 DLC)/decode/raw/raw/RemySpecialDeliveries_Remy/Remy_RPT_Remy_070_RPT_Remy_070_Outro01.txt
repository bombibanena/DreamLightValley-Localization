Well, {PlayerName}? How did things go with Vanellope?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Did she admit to liking vegetables?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She loved them! Even though she didn't want to admit it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think she'll be ordering some more veggies from you soon.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Excellent! I knew she'd like whatever you made. You should be proud, {PlayerName}. That takes real culinary talent.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Your skills are getting pretty incredible. Who knows? Someday you might open Chez {PlayerName}!

Here you go. Some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem>, courtesy of Mr. McDuck.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Use it to build something great for the Village. The more deliveries you do for Chez Remy Mobile, the more we'll be able to order.

Did Vanellope unlock the full power of her dragon breath?

TAG: Player_002_f
Yes... at Merlin.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
It was hilarious.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maybe don't serve her any more spicy food for a while.

TAG: Remy_014_f
Yikes! Well, I guess her running around like that is free advertising. Maybe I could add a Dragon Breath Special to my menu if it catches on.

So, who did the "final boss" turn out to be? Did Vanellope win the battle?

TAG: Player_003_f
The final boss was Scrooge McDuck.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
He wasn't too happy about being treated like a villain.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Which kind of makes sense, honestly?!

TAG: Remy_015_f
I don't blame him. I've heard that a lot of video games don't have such a great attitude toward rats, which is completely unfair.

TAG: Remy_018_f
But in any case, it sounds like the dishes you made were perfect for what Vanellope was looking for.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Hmm... big horde of gold... seems to run everything that goes on in the Village behind the scenes... complete control of the Village economy...

TAG: Remy_017_f
Whoa, I think Vanellope could be on to something.
