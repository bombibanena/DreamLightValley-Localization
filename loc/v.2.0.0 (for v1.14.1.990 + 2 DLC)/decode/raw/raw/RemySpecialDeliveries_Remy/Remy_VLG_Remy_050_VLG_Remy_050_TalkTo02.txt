Nice work, {PlayerName}! And to say thanks, I've got something for you.

TAG: Remy_001_f
It's <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What can I make with this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Am I supposed to eat this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is it okay if I sell it?

TAG: Remy_003_f
SO many great things.

TAG: Remy_002_f
You can use it to start rebuilding the seating area around Chez Remy, if you'd like.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Chairs... tables... a fence... paths... even that giant statue that used to be outside.

TAG: Remy_009_f
And hey, if you run out of <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem>, just come back and see me.

TAG: Remy_010_f
I'll have one special delivery for you every day. And I'll keep ordering <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> from Mr. McDuck to give to you each time you finish a delivery.

TAG: Remy_008_f
I'd love to see you <Lore>try building something with that Wrought Iron</Lore>. No time like the present, right?

TAG: Remy_004_f
No, no, no. I am a master at working with the ingredients at hand, but not even I could make that into something edible.

TAG: Remy_005_f
You're supposed to build with it!

TAG: Remy_007_f
I mean, you could! I'm not gonna stop you. But I think it's way more useful for building stuff.
