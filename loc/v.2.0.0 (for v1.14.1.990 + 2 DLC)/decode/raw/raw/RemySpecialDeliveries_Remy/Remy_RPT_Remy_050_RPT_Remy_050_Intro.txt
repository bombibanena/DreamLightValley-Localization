Hey, {PlayerName}! Are you ready for another challenge of your culinary skills?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Today's customer is the Fairy Godmother! Even though she could magic these up herself, she told me hers never taste quite as good as what we make.

TAG: Remy_003_f
I guess she's throwing some sort of pumpkin party and wants some pumpkin-y meals for the event.

TAG: Remy_004_f
I think some <ActivityItem>Pumpkin Puffs</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Pumpkin Soup</ActivityItem> would be perfect.

TAG: Remy_005_f
What do you say? Are you up to the challenge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.

TAG: Remy_007_f
And remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Hey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Remember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.

TAG: Remy_016_f
She's asked for some "dreamy meals": <ActivityItem>Dream Fizz</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Dream Ice Cream</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_010_f
But the Fairy Godmother doesn't want the meals for herself. You'll have to ask her who they're for.

TAG: Remy_011_f
That Fairy Godmother â always thinking of everyone else first.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Today, she asked for some <ActivityItem>Desserts</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_013_f
I wonder who they're for...? The Fairy Godmother doesn't usually ask for things for herself.

TAG: Remy_014_f
{PlayerName}! I've got a special delivery order for you. And this is going to be a fun one!

TAG: Remy_015_f
{PlayerName}! I have another Chez Remy Mobile order for you.
