Well, look who it is... {PlayerName} returns. And what can I do for you, angelfish?

TAG: Player_000_f
I'm putting together a Care Package for the Fairy Godmother, and I was wondering if you could help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She's been nothing but nice to everyone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sure she could learn from you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I freed you. You owe me.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
BAH! That scatter-brained meddler! She's giving magical help to everyone for free.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
No one comes to me anymore. They all go to her, no deal required. She's ruining all my hard work.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
*sigh* But I suppose she has been rather nice to me. Unlike that blowhard Merlin.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Come on. There must be something you have lying around that you could part with, just to show a little appreciation?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Ugh. Fine... Here. It's a <ActivityItem>Memento Memoria Potion</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
If you've lost something, simply drop a few dashes of this into a basin of water.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Whisper whatever it is you're looking for, and the reflection will show you where last you left it.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Maybe that'll help her the next time she misplaces that wand of hers!

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Well, she could start by not giving her services away for free!

TAG: Ursula_008_f
And clearly you'll never let me forget.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Hmph. I actually respect that. Unlike that scatterbrained meddler of a fairy godmother...

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Giving everything to everyone and not asking for anything in exchange.
