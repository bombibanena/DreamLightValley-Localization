Angelfish, have you finally come to ask for my help dealing with all that trouble in the sky? It's about time!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You have a beautiful voice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Nobody's better at making deals.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm afraid of you... but in, like, a good way!

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
No deal, Ursula.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
You're right. I do need your help. Take a look.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
What is this rubble you're handing me?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
If you're looking to trade, you'll need to find something far better than all this.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
I found those <ActivityItem>Beach Toys</ActivityItem> in the same cave that I freed you from. I think they used to belong to the Forgotten.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Do you remember them? These might be the key to saving Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Hmm... Now that you mention it, they do look a tad familiar.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
I'll tell you about them... and all it'll cost you is a simple commendation. I hear everyone else around here are receiving them. Don't I deserve some accolades, too?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
I do, don't I? Remind me to serenade you sometime, free of charge.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Now then... Those trinkets... You used to play with them as a child...

TAG: Ursula_015_f
... You and Moana.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Moana? But she's not in the Village.

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Well, then to have any hope of saving the Valley, you'll have to <Lore>find her and bring her back here</Lore>, won't you?

TAG: Ursula_021_f
I suspect the answers lie behind one of those doors in the Dream Castle.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Moana? Of course. I'll go <Lore>talk to Moana</Lore>.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
And {PlayerName}? When you find the Forgotten and stop this little scheme, tell them to come see me.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
I can teach them a thing or two about getting what they want.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
And don't you forget it. I always comes out on top.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Ha! Well, if you can't be loved, at least make sure you're feared; that's always worked for me.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Ugh. Of course. You can't even spare a kind word for me to save the Village.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
If the whole Village falls apart, there won't be anybody around here to make deals with. Spill it, Ursula.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
Oh, fine. I may as well.
