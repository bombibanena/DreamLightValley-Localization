{PlayerName}, I'm so glad you're here! I don't want to alarm you, but I've noticed that the Village seems to be... er... broken.

TAG: Olaf_022_f
The sky looks angry. Unfortunately, my arms aren't long enough to give it a hug.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I was hoping you could help me with all that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Try not to worry about that too much.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But how would you even hug the sky...?

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Me? Oh, I love to help!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Wait... How am I supposed to help?

TAG: Olaf_005_f
I found a blanket in the secret chamber. I think it used to belong to the Forgotten.

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Do you know anything about it?

TAG: Olaf_014_f
*gasp* The fuzzy, cuddly blanket! You found it! Hooray! ... But I don't know TOO much about it.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
Ooh! But I do know who might...

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Elsa! I remember it from her room at the castle. Of course, she doesn't get cold, but I think she just likes being cozy sometimes.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Elsa... So I'd need her to learn the story behind this blanket?

TAG: Olaf_023_f
Yep! But she went back to Arendelle during the Forgetting.

TAG: Olaf_024_f
Oh, maybe you could find her behind one of the doors in the Dream Castle!

TAG: Olaf_025_f
I'd be so happy if Elsa was here!

TAG: Olaf_026_f
Thanks, Olaf. I'll have to <Lore>bring Elsa back to the Village</Lore> if we're to have any hope of stopping the Forgotten.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
And in the meantime, I'll just find and categorize all the different kinds of rocks in the Village.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great plan!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Um... why?

TAG: Olaf_018_f
I thought so!

TAG: Olaf_017_f
I'm calling it "controlling what I can when things feel out of control."

TAG: Olaf_002_f
She has to know the story behind that blanket!

TAG: Olaf_027_f
Thanks, Olaf. I guess I'll have to go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore> if we're to have any hope of stopping the Forgotten.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
I did think it was something for the oldest and wisest in the Village to handle.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
That's true. But you could help me, I think.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
No idea! But it's on my list of things to research.

TAG: Olaf_000_f
Is there anything else I could do to help until I find a sky-hugging technique?
