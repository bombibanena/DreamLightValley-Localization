Bonjour, {PlayerName}. It's nice to see you. I'm working on a new story! It's the second part of a previous one...

TAG: Belle_001_f
...a fairytale adventure about a young woman who's turned into a creature when she's scratched by enchanted thorns.

TAG: Belle_002_f
But I'm afraid I don't know where her adventures should take her next.

TAG: Player_000_f
How about...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...an adventure at sea?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...a palace in the clouds?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Actually, I'm in a hurry. Can I borrow some ink?

TAG: Belle_005_f
What a wonderful idea! I can already imagine a mighty storm... Perhaps a shipwreck?!

TAG: Belle_007_f
Oh, but you didn't come to see me just to discuss my story... How can I help you?

TAG: Belle_008_f
Do you have any ink I could borrow? Mushu and I are helping the Beast with something.

TAG: Belle_009_f
Of course. I have plenty. Please, take some.

TAG: Belle_010_f
Thanks Belle; good luck with your story.

TAG: Belle_004_f
Yes... perhaps she climbs the tallest tree in an enchanted forest, up into the sky, and discovers a new kingdom there?
