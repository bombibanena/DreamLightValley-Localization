Well? What did that irritating rabbit say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He said you threatened to turn him into a stew.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He said something about you hunting him?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Threatened...? Ha! I was merely speculating on how easy he would be to hunt and whether it would be worth it.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
In the end, I decided he'd be much too stringy to make a satisfying stew.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Let's just be clear. No hunting anyone. Got it?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
*sigh* Fine. But you won't stop me from target practice. I have to stay sharp!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Target practicing is okay, but forget about that for now. What's important is Oswald suggested we go on a little Island tour.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
An Island tour?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
That's right, Gaston! We need to stir up your emotions, get you thinking on some of your past heroic deeds!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Hmm... well, there is the place where I was first shipwrecked here on Eternity Isle. That was an exceedingly heroic moment.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
That's perfect! <Lore>Lead the way!</Lore>
