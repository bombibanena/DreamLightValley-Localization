ARGH!

He's not really a magician.

What happened after you lost control?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Gaston! Are you all right?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Now I am, but before... I was enchanted!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Enchanted? What do you mean?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Those burning, red snake eyes... I felt myself lose control of this perfect specimen of a physique!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Then it was like I was watching myself from a distance.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I'm going to give that magician a piece of my mind!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
I'm sorry â magician? You're not talking about Merlin, are you?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
No! The other scrawny one. In red and black.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Huh? But I always see him scribbling those magical symbols on paper whenever I pass by the Palace.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
You know, the x, the tiny numbers on top of other numbers, stuff like that.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Are you referring to... math? Jafar knows a lot about mathematics as well as magic.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
There's a difference?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Okay, let's get back on track. What happened after you were hypnotized?

TAG: Gaston_014_f
When hypnotized, I was used! ... Like a draft horse, <Lore>lugging Jafar's equipment from the Palace to the Ancient Ruins</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Thanks Gaston; I'll check up on the <Lore>Ancient Ruins</Lore> next.
