{PlayerName}, I'm not convinced the way you're running this Island is the best.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
I've made a list of all the ways you could improve things here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's hear it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Instead of that... why not help me out right now?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
First, I don't like how things keep turning black and white. I suggest you stop all that.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Next, Eternity Isle needs more statues of me. One in Ancient's Landing, one in the Glittering Dunes, and one in the Wild Tangle.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Anything else?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Okay, that's enough. How about you help me out now?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Yes! THIRDLY, the names of things around this Isle need to change. I was thinking of "Gaston's Landing," the "Gastonian Dunes," and the "Tangle Gaston."

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Fourthly, "Eternity Isle"? Please! Everyone should be calling the place "Gaston." Or maybe "Gaston's Eternity Isle"!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Is that your whole list?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Okay, that's enough. How about you help me out now?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Hardly! Let me see... more sidekicks for me... daily performances to celebrate my feats... some sort of contraption to funnel eggs directly into my mouth even faster...

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Ooh. Belle's love and admiration given only to me. That would improve things around here quite a bit, if you can manage it.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Why don't we circle back to all that once we fix the more pressing issues around the Isle together?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Hmm... all right. Fine. What do you need?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Those black and white rifts around Eternity Isle... I need YOUR help to fix them.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
How convenient! A very pesky one just opened up in my camp.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
<Lore>Follow me</Lore>! I'll show you!
