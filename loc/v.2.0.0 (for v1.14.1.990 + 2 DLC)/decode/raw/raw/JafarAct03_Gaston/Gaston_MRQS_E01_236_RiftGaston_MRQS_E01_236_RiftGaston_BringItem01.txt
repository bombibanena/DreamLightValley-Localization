{PlayerName}, this is just a bunch of wood and glass. I'm not very impressed by your making-a-ship-in-a-bottle skills.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
These are just the materials. You have to make it yourself, Gaston!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Come on. Let's get to it.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
If I must...

TAG: Gaston_009_f
There!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
What do you think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's beautiful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Well... at least you tried.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did you just break open the bottle and tape it back together after?!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Of course it is. It's the first thing I've ever imagined, and it came out perfectly!

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Let's go! Now we've just gotta go <Lore>toss it in the rift</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Ha! Barely! And it still came out perfectly.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
I detect a hint of jealousy, {PlayerName}. Don't worry. Someday you'll make something half as good.
