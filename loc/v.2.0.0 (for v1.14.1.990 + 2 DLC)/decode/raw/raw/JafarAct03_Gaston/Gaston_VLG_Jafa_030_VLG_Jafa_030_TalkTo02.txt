Hey Gaston, how are you feeling today?

TAG: Gaston_016_f
I spoke with Rapunzel and she seemed... kinda off.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
<i>How unfortunate. Personally, I feel like a paragon of vitality!</i>

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Excuse me, what?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
<i>I am infused with exuberance! I revel in exertion! Behold, the manly perspiration that dots my brow!</i>

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I'm glad for you. Unfortunately, Oswald's been under the weather.

<i>Perhaps he should seek a medicinal remedy from Jafar. I hear his alchemical skills are unmatched!</i>

TAG: Gaston_008_f
<i>I am sure creating a simple tonic would not tax him unduly.</i>

Your vocabulary seems different.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I already tried bringing him some food.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
<i>Oh... Am I not permitted to improve my communication skills?</i>

TAG: Gaston_010_f
No, of course you are...

TAG: Gaston_012_f
It just seems weird for you.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Okay, this conversation is going strangely.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
I think I'm going to continue on with my survey.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
<i>But of course. Goodbye, {PlayerName}.</i>

TAG: Gaston_011_f
But it didn't really help.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
<i>One hopes he is not taking notes from that foul floating machine!</i>

TAG: Gaston_014_f
<i>Her aversion to sustenance is uncanny.</i>

TAG: Gaston_017_f
I was talking with Mr. McDuck, and he seems a little strange today.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
<i>Simply stupendous, {PlayerName}! I am a paragon of vitality!</i>
