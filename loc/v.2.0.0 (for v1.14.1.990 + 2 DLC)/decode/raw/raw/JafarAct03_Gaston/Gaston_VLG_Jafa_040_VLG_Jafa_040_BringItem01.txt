Hey Gaston, I got the furniture for you. Ready to set it all up for me?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Of course! No one can lift heavy furniture like Gaston!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Thanks, I've been so busy with the planning; this is a huge help.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Hmm... where is the judge going to sit?

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Oh, I guess I hadn't thought about that yet. I still need to talk to Oswald to see who will be taking that role during the trial.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
{PlayerName}... I have an idea.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's a first.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You do? I'm all ears!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
No, it's not. I have an excellent idea at least once a month! Now then...

TAG: Gaston_010_f
The judge is the most important person in a trial, right?

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Sure, I guess you could say that.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Well, then the judge deserves a powerful chair! And I know just the one...

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I'll set it up with the rest of the other furnishings now.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Oh, that's very helpful of you, Gaston, thanks!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
No, you're not. I can see you only have two ears. Though, "all ears" wouldn't be the strangest thing I've seen here.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
It's a figure of speech, Gaston. What's your idea?
