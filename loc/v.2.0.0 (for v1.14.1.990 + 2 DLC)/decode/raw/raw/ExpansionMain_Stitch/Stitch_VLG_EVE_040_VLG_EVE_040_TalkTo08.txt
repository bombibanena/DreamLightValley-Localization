Big BOOM! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Player_000_f
Yes, the <ActivityItem>Experimental Fireworks</ActivityItem> made a big boom. But EVE was scared...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
And frankly, so was I...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's not safe right now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
And even if I had fun, that's not what I want.

TAG: Stitch_002_f
Oh...

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Stitch didn't want to scare {PlayerName}.

TAG: Stitch_007_f
It's okay, Stitch.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Can you help me make the fireworks more safe?

TAG: Stitch_009_f
Yes. Can you help Stitch too? Stitch is looking for <ActivityItem>Socks</ActivityItem>. Left them here before Forgetting.

TAG: Stitch_010_f
You look for <ActivityItem>Socks</ActivityItem>, and Stitch talk to Old Beard Man about fireworks?

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Okitaka?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Okitaka!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Anything to avoid talking to Merlin.

TAG: Stitch_013_f
Akatoo-keeee!

TAG: Stitch_016_f
I'll get you your <ActivityItem>Socks</ActivityItem>. I'm guessing I'll need my Hourglass to find them...

TAG: Stitch_000_f
Old Beard Man said <ActivityItem>Socks</ActivityItem> lost in time... Stitch bad to leave them all over Island...

TAG: Stitch_015_f
Oojooba!

TAG: Stitch_003_f
Oh. Stitch sorry.

TAG: Stitch_005_f
You don't need to apologize! It's not your fault. I was just wondering...

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Ogata...
