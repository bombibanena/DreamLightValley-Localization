Well, besides my family, it's my Number One Dime.

TAG: Player_000_f
Let me guess why. Your Number One Dime...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...brings you luck.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...is the first dime you ever made.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...is your true love.

I call it my Number One because it's the first bit of money I ever earned.

When it comes to me fortune, there's no luck about it. I've worked hard for my money... especially that first coin.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
That's right! Well done... though it is right there in the name. My Number One Dime.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I was working as a shoeshiner in Glasgow when I earned it. And that inspired me to build my fortune across the sea.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
But that's a story for another day.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
No, no. That's romantic but not it.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
My Number One Dime is the first coin I ever earned... I mean, it's right there in the name.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Nothing will bring more satisfaction than money well earned and well saved.

So maybe, in a way, you were right after all.
