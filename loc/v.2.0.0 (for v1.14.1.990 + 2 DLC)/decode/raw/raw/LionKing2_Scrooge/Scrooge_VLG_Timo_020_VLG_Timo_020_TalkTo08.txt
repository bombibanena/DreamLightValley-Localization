I'm trying to help Timon with something...

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Och. Unfortunately, no. I dinnae have anything like that in stock at the moment.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Hmm, that's too bad.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I want to help Timon make a slideshow presentation of the critters in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Well, you might want to try fishin' around the Forest of Valor. There may even be a <ActivityItem>Rusted Recorder</ActivityItem> in one of those ponds. I accidentally dropped one there ages ago and havenae had any luck fishin' it out!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Thanks! I'll <Lore>go fishing in the Forest of Valor</Lore> and hopefully find something helpful!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
And what might you be helping the wee lad with?
