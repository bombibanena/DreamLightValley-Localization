Ah, {PlayerName}, I'm feelin' a bit of wanderlust today. Perhaps I need a little adventure.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Have you ever been on a grand treasure hunt?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, of course!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not yet...

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
An expert! Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one. Tell me then, where's your favorite place to find treasure?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Under the sea.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Ancient ruins.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I just want to explore, like you!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
An excellent choice!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I've heard tales of Ariel's collection of rare artifacts. Though, I haven't had the chance to see it myself.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
I'll start making plans to visit. Just as a spectator, I assure you.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Oh aye, plenty of curiosities can be found in our past.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
One day, we'll discover more ancient ruins here.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
I just KNOW this Valley hasn't given up all its secrets yet!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
An adventurer after me own heart!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
When we're done exploring the Valley together, perhaps we'll find even more spots that aren't on any map.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Ah, then we must go! Tell me, where would you like to visit?
