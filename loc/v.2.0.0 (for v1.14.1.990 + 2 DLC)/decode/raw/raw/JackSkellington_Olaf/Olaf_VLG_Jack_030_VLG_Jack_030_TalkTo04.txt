Hi, Olaf! Can I ask you a few questions?

TAG: Olaf_011_f
You know, that doesn't surprise me at all.

I just love the looks on their faces when they unwrap something I've given them...

TAG: Olaf_013_f
It's like the best warm hug ever!

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Perfect, thanks Olaf!

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Of course, {PlayerName}! I love answering questions.

Jack Skellington and I are trying to come up with a new holiday for Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
And we wanted to ask what your favorite holiday is and why.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Well, holidays are too special to choose just one, but I definitely have a favorite holiday activity.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Sure, that works â what is it?

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Giving presents!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
All year long I collect trivia about my friends... What they like, what they need, and the things they don't do for themselves...

TAG: Olaf_009_f
And then I come up with the perfect present for them!
