Salutations, friends! How nice to see you! And to what do I owe the pleasure?

TAG: Player_000_f
Hi, Jack. We're looking for Night Mites!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Have you seen any around?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Timon and Pumbaa tracked some here by scent.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Where are you hiding them?!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Me? Oh... No. Certainly not!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
I wouldn't know one if I laid eyes on it. Or rather, my eye sockets! Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
It is a shame you've caught them all. They seemed fascinating... I mean, from what I've heard, that is.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
"Fascinating," huh? Mind if we have a look around?

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Oh... I... Of course.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
... Please, I have nothing to hide.

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
How strange! There are definitely no Night Mites here.

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Though I wish there were! Those strange purple bugs are fascinating.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Me? Why would I hide something so... frighteningly fascinating as a Night Mite?
