Mother Gothel? What's going on here?

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Well, I was hoping to have a quiet moment to myself.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
But clearly you have other plans.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
That's not what I mean...

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Why is Little Louis in a cage in your House?

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Little Louis? Do you mean that reptilian pest?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's not a pest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This is low, even for you.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
It's quite simple, {PlayerName}. Your "Little Louis" was destroying my garden.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
So, I simply did what one does with pests â trap them.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Maybe we can come to an understanding. What if Tiana and I make you a new garden?

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
And then I let the pest out and it destroys my garden again? I think not.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You know, living in a tree naturally exposes one to animals...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
This is quite the overreaction for an animal getting into your garden.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You seem determined to find fault in everything I say...

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
And clearly, I am more important than the animals!

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Okay, fine. What if we set up some fences to protect the garden?

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
That could be... acceptable.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Great! What did you have in your garden before?

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
It was a mix of vegetable plots â <ActivityItem>Okra</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Spinach</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
As for the fencing, I want <ActivityItem>White Picket Fences</ActivityItem>. That MIGHT keep my garden safe in the future.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
Here â take this. If I have to wait for you to gather everything yourself, I'll be waiting for years!

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Ugh, fine, we'll get right on that.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
Hardly! I cared for those vegetables, nourished and raised them myself!

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
Well dear, have you tried saying less foolish things?

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
I have evidence to the contrary.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
I was merely protecting what is mine.
