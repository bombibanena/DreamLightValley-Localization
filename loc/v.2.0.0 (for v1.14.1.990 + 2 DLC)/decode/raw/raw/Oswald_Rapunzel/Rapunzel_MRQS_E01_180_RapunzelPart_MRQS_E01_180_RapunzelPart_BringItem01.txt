Wow, {PlayerName}. This tea... the soup...

They look just like what Mother used to make. I'm so excited to try them. Thank you so much!

Hey, that's what friends are for!

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Let's see if they taste as good as what Mother used to make...

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Hmm... Those weren't as good as Mother's...

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
They were SO MUCH better!

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
They might taste better, but did they help...? Do you think you can sing?

The scratchiness in my throat is going away, but why don't you come back in a little while to be sure?

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
When Mother would make this for me, it always took about five minutes to start working.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
No problem!

I'm so happy to have a friend like you. Don't get me wrong; I love the capybaras, but they aren't very good cooks. *giggle*
