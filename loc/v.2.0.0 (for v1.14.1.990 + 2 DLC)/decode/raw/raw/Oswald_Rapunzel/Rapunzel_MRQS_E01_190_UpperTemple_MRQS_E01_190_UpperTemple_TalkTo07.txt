{PlayerName}, I've been looking at these musical notes on the wall...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Right now, the melody they make is off somehow.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
It's not so much do-re-mi as...

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
...do-do-do-do-do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds like a beautiful melody to me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It just needs a decent harmony to go along with it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Er, yeah, I don't think that's the solution.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Do you think so?

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Huh. Maybe it is, but I don't think it's the solution to this puzzle.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Don't worry. I WILL figure this out.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Why don't you go <Lore>help Gaston</Lore>? I'm worried he might get himself into trouble over there.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
I guess it might make a good bass melody for a set of chords...

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
But I don't think that's the solution to our puzzle.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Neither do I.
