Ahhh... ahhh... AHHHH... ahhh...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
CHOOOOOO!!!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Gesundheit?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uh... you okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe I'll come back later...

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Ugh. I'm sorry, {PlayerName}. I got really close to one of those big flytrap plants and it let out a big cloud of pollen right in my face.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
But I really want to help you after all the ways you've helped me!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
A-A-ACHOO! *sigh* If only I had the tea or the soup that Mother used to make me...

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
You see, whenever I had a sore throat, she'd make them, and after just a few sips, I could sing again.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Maybe I could make you some?

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
*sniffles* Do you think you could do it? I'd make them myself, but Mother had special recipes that she wouldn't share with me.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
I've been sneezing ever since and my throat is all scratchy.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
I'm sure I'll be fine soon. Did you need something? Is there anything I can help with?

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
I'm on the trail of this special treasure called the Spark of Imagination.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
But to find it, I need to solve this special puzzle involving musical notes.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
It seems like we'll need to know the right notes, and we'll need somebody to sing them.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Oh no. If that's why you're here, I don't think I can help anytime soon.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
With my throat this scratchy, I haven't been able to sing a note all day.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Oh... I guess I could ask someone else to help with that part.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
I really don't want to ask Mother for help. Not after I've come such a long way. I just know she'll ask me to sing for her in return.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Your Mother left some stuff in your tower. Could it be up there?

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
You know, you might be right. ACHOO! Ugh... She left a bunch of things there.

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
But I haven't looked through any of it yet. I've been too busy exploring the Isle.

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
No problem. I'll go <Lore>search your Tower</Lore> and see what I can find.

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
And since no one's seen Mother in quite a while... the recipes might be lost.
