Hi Rapunzel! Got a delivery for you!

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
*yawn* For me? But I wasn't expecting anything.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Oswald and I want to apologize for waking you up.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Those alarm clocks kinda went wild for a while...

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
That's very kind of you, but you don't need toâ

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
*yyyyaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn*

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Rapunzel, you're falling asleep on your feet!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uhh, seems like we actually do need to.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Try this. But a little heads-up â Oswald's coffee has some odd effects to it...

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Oh, I'm sure his coffee's delicious.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
*sip sip* <i>Zowie, that'll get your peepers poppin'!</i>

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Huh? I mean...

TAG: Rapunzel_000_f
Oh, it's happening to you too? Don't worry; it'll be over soon!

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
I feel wonderful. I'm going to clean my room! And then paint a picture! And then go exploring!

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
Wow, that makes ME feel tired.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
<i>That joe was like a sock right to the button!</i>

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
...

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
<i>If that's not the bees knees! No way I'm gonna flop at the drop of a hat now...</i>

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
You okay, Rapunzel?

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Umm... <i>Best. Day. Ever!</i> ... <i>Tell that to my frying pan.</i> ... Yep, I think I'm back to normal now.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
That was strange... but fun!

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Yeah, Oswald always has something strange up his sleeve.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
But I hope you're feeling more alert now.

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
What? You sound like you're right out of the roaring '20s!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Try this.
