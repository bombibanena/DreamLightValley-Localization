Uh-oh. You have that look on your face, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Anna_001_f
That "I have something strange and possibly magical to ask you about, so don't ask too many follow-up questions" look.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Bingo.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's definitely magical, but only a little bit strange.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I didn't realize that was a look I had...

TAG: Anna_002_f
Ha! I knew it.

TAG: Anna_011_f
That was perfect, Anna. Thanks for your help.

TAG: Anna_003_f
Well, let's hear it. How can I help?

TAG: Anna_004_f
It's simple. Just tell me what you like best about Minnie.

TAG: Anna_005_f
What I like best about Minnie...? Oh. Hmm...

TAG: Anna_006_f
That's a tough one. There's so much to like. To love, really!

TAG: Anna_007_f
I guess if I have to narrow it down, I'd say that what I like best about Minnie is how she always makes me smile.

TAG: Anna_008_f
She's so kind, but also SO funny. She always notices the little things around here.

TAG: Anna_009_f
She makes me laugh almost as much as Olaf does!

TAG: Anna_010_f
Did that help...?

TAG: Anna_012_f
Ooh, so close!

TAG: Anna_013_f
Oh, definitely. It's kind of like the look I get on my face when I'm on a search for chocolate.
