Ah, {PlayerName}! Just the Space Ranger I was looking for.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
I have another mission for you. It's a Code G-7B.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
An action figure is missing its removable parts?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A doll lost some accessories that were sold separately?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A stuffed animal fell into the dog's water dish?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
A toy's gone missing?

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Close, Space Ranger. Missing components is a Code G-6B.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Code G-7B is a search and rescue.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Remember those <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> that wandered away from Woody's Carousel? At the time, I suspected a few were unaccounted for.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
And I was right. I now have intel that many of them are somewhere in the Village.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
We have to find and rescue them!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What if they don't want to be rescued?

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Precisely. Those toys could be out there frightened and disoriented.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
And have you seen the size of the squirrels around here?

TAG: Buzz_012_f
They could turn those <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> into chew toys in no time.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Okay, where should I start looking?

TAG: Buzz_014_f
We'll need to do a survey of every sector in the Village.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
There's no telling where the <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> might have gone.

TAG: Buzz_020_f
Toys are highly skilled at hiding in the backs of closets, behind beds, and between couch cushions.

TAG: Buzz_022_f
Got it. I'll look everywhere in the Village.

TAG: Buzz_023_f
Oh, and one final thing.

TAG: Buzz_024_f
These <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> can be a bit shy. They might not all come out of hiding at once.

TAG: Buzz_025_f
Keep an eye out for them while you complete your regular duties. I suspect they could pop up in multiple locations.

TAG: Buzz_016_f
Hmm... But there's one sector that's still closed off, isn't there?

TAG: Buzz_017_f
That's right! I think that place is called the Forgotten Lands...

TAG: Buzz_018_f
I can't imagine why any toy would want to go there. Being forgotten is a sad thing for a toy.

TAG: Buzz_019_f
But you'll need to check there too if you want to be sure you've located them all.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Unlikely. They're probably out there frightened and disoriented.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Not bad, Space Ranger. Missing equipment is a Code G-7A.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Not even close, Space Ranger. An aquatic canine incident is a Code G-7C.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Exactly! Someone's been reading their Star Command handbook!
