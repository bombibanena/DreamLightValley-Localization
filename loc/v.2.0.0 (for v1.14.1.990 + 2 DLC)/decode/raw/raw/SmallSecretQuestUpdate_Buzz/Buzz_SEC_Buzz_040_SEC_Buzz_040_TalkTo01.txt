{PlayerName}, just who I was hoping to see! I'm afraid the <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> have outgrown their home in the claw game.

Would it be possible to make them their own outpost, somewhere in the Valley?

TAG: Buzz_002_f
An outpost in the Valley...? Like, decorate it for them?

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Precisely. I'd make suggestions, but this is really more your area of expertise, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_000_f
Hmm. A space in the Village just for the Aliens. I guess I could make it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...chic and retro!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...cozy and fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...weird and funky!

I'm sure whatever you do will be more than adequate. You've got style, my friend.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Why don't you take one of these little fellas along with you?

Anything else you need, I'm sure you'll be able to order from the local vendor, Scrooge McDuck.
