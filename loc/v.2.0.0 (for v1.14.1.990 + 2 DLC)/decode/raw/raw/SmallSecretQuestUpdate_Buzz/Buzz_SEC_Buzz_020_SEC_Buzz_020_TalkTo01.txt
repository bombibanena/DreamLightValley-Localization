Space Ranger, we've got another situation on our hands. This one's a Code L-5X.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Plastic figurine in the garbage disposal?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Child administered haircut to doll?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Pointy toy left on floor in hallway?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Wandering Extraterrestrial?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Someone needs to review their handbook again. That's a Code I-5X. And I hope for all our sakes that never happens here.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Code L-5X means we have toys where they shouldn't be. Some of the <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> are <Lore>hiding in the Villagers' houses</Lore>.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Uh-oh. I guess I'll need to check for them...

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Precisely. The last thing we need is a Villager stepping on one of them in the middle of the night.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
There's no telling which houses they might be hiding in today. So, I recommend you keep an eye out while you do your regular rounds of the Village.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
I'll be on alert as well. I'll let you know if I see any.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
A definite emergency... but I'm afraid that's a Code L-6X. Better review your handbook.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
That would pose quite a danger to any parents or siblings walking around in bare feet, but that code is L-5Y. Better review your handbook.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Precisely! You've got that handbook practically memorized, haven't you?
