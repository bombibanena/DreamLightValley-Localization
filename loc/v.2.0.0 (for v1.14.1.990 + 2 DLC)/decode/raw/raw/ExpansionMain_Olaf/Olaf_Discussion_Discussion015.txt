{Placeholder}Great! We're having so much fun together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
{Placeholder}That's awesome!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
{Placeholder}That's a surprise...

TAG: Olaf_001_f
{Placeholder}Isn't it?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
{Placeholder}Did he tell you to say that?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
{Placeholder}No! He actually told me I should be quiet most of the time.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
{Placeholder}Isn't that a funny joke?

TAG: Olaf_005_f
{Placeholder}Okay, I think I may need to have a word with him...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
{Placeholder}What kind of sidekick things have you been doing together?

TAG: Olaf_007_f
{Placeholder}We worked out together!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
{Placeholder}He said that I had stick arms and that I needed to pump coconuts.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
{Placeholder}Did you like the workout?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
{Placeholder}He may have a point...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
{Placeholder}Did you get any gains?

TAG: Olaf_009_f
{Placeholder}I did... he called it sit-ups?

TAG: Olaf_010_f
{Placeholder}It felt like my insides were giving me warm hugs!

TAG: Olaf_011_f
{Placeholder}One thing though...

TAG: Olaf_012_f
{Placeholder}What does "leg day" mean? Gaston said I might have trouble with that.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
{Placeholder}Don't worry about it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
{Placeholder}Just think of it as "foot day."

TAG: Olaf_013_f
{Placeholder}Okay!

TAG: Olaf_014_f
{Placeholder}Got it!

TAG: Olaf_015_f
{Placeholder}Maybe I should find some thicker sticks for my arms...

TAG: Olaf_016_f
{Placeholder}I gained an even greater desire to get a hug from Gaston!

TAG: Olaf_017_f
{Placeholder}I love surprises!

TAG: Olaf_018_f
{Placeholder}Well, first I was sad that I lost...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
{Placeholder}Don't be sad, Olaf!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
{Placeholder}You can't win them all...

TAG: Olaf_019_f
{Placeholder}I realized something though â I can be everyone's sidekick!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
{Placeholder}I... guess?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
{Placeholder}How does that work?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
{Placeholder}Sure, nobody can stop you from being helpful!

TAG: Olaf_020_f
{Placeholder}I've been helping Gaston and so many others!

TAG: Olaf_021_f
{Placeholder}I like to think of myself as the sidekick of ALL of Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
{Placeholder}Olaf, you're too cute.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
{Placeholder}Keep up the good work!

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
{Placeholder}I hope people appreciate the work you do!

TAG: Olaf_022_f
{Placeholder}That's what Minnie said!

TAG: Olaf_023_f
{Placeholder}That's the plan!

TAG: Olaf_024_f
{Placeholder}They do! Even Gaston. I'm sure, though he hasn't said it...
