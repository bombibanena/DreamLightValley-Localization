Hey there, {PlayerName}. What kind of culinary adventure are you on today?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A rather strange one.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I wish I knew.

TAG: Remy_001_f
Oh? Breaking new ground? Interesting...

TAG: Remy_011_f
You're telling me!

TAG: Remy_012_f
From the conversations I've had with Mike and Sulley...

TAG: Remy_013_f
I wonder if they have an expanded range of taste.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Expanded range? What do you mean?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll let them worry about their own taste buds.

TAG: Remy_003_f
I'm helping Mike Wazowski with a little project.

TAG: Remy_004_f
We need a fish, one that might be a little aged. Think you might be able to help?

TAG: Remy_005_f
Sure! Are you doing some experiments in fermentation?

TAG: Remy_006_f
You might call it that...

TAG: Remy_007_f
That's fantastic! Are you making some surstrÃ¶ming? Maybe some funazushi?

TAG: Remy_008_f
Just about every culture around the world uses fermentation in some way.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Actually... it will be for some cologne.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Oh! Okay... That's unusual.

TAG: Remy_015_f
Well, we all have specific tastes â sweet, salty, sour, etc.

TAG: Remy_016_f
But what if the monsters have a more expanded palate?

TAG: Remy_017_f
What if what we think of as "gross" is just another taste to them the way bitter or umami is to us?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I think you're on to something.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm okay with my current taste buds.

TAG: Remy_018_f
Anyway, here's that fish.

TAG: Remy_019_f
Haven't had a lot of seafood orders the past couple days, so it's past its prime. I was just about to put it in the compost. Hopefully, it'll work for your plan.

TAG: Remy_020_f
Great, thanks Remy! I'll... try and breathe through my mouth while dealing with this.

TAG: Remy_014_f
I get that.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Huh. I'm intrigued!
