Hey, {PlayerName}, what are we cooking today?

Mike asked me for fresh Ingredients. But when I brought them, he complained that they weren't like what you make for him.

I think I know what went wrong. I always make sure that each of his meals contains some <ActivityItem>Fresh Compost</ActivityItem>.

Monster palates seem to prefer a degree of decay.

So if I prepare something called a <ActivityItem>Hodgepodge Ã  la Monstropolis</ActivityItem> and I already have <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Corn</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Bell Peppers</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Remy_010_f
Just add some <ActivityItem>Fresh Compost</ActivityItem> to the recipe and you're in business.

To each their own, I guess.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
If that's what I need to do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eww... Disgusting.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Exactly! One monster's delicacy is somebody else's garbage.

TAG: Remy_006_f
If you need some <ActivityItem>Fresh Compost</ActivityItem>, I just put it outside to enrich the soil. It should be near the Restaurant.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Sometimes that's what it takes to be a great chef.

Hey, not everyone eats the same thing. And it's not our place to judge but... I hear you. Monster food isn't my favorite, either.
