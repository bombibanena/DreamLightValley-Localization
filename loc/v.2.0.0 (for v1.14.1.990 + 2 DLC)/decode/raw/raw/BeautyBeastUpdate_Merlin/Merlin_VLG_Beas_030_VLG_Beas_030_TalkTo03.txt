Ah, what brings you to see me today, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
It's, uhh, a bit of a sensitive situation.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
I could use some magical advice if you have a moment.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Of course! What seems to be the trouble?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
I'm trying to help the Beast with some self-improvement. He's got some... let's say, anger issues that he's trying to move past.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I see... Well, has he tried being a squirrel or a fish for an afternoon?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
In my experience, spending time in animal form can be quite illuminating!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I don't think the Beast would appreciate that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Tempting...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Hmmm, yes, I suppose not...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
The Beast knows that he has a good heart. He just needs some help connecting to it.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Ah! Say no more.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
There's an enchanted item that might be of use here â the <ActivityItem>Mirror of True Seeing</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Go on...

TAG: Merlin_012_f
When one looks into the Mirror, it shows one's true self without any perceived illusions or self-deceptions.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
So if the Beast looks into it...

TAG: Merlin_014_f
He will see his real inner strength, his compassion. Everything he doubts yet carries within.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Perfect! How do I make it?

TAG: Merlin_016_f
You'll need a <ActivityItem>Gold Ingot</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
I'll get started on that â thanks, Merlin!

TAG: Merlin_018_f
So if Mother Gothel looks into it...

TAG: Merlin_019_f
She shall see the part of her that acts so cruelly.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
But I think we're looking for more of an internal change.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Well, we've been having some issues with Mother Gothel's treatment of the other Villagers.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
She was extremely rude to Belle and quite infuriated the Beast.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Ahh, you wish to turn her into a frog for a bit? Say no more.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
That's a nice offer, but not exactly what I'm looking for...

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Perhaps a squirrel? Or maybe a fish?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Very tempting...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Nah, I think we'll stay away from transformations for now...

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Spending time as an animal always teaches a lesson, in my experience.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
We need something that will show Mother Gothel exactly the kind of person she is.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
She's always so self-assured and arrogant! If she saw herself the way so many others see her, I don't think she'd be so quick to lash out.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
A pity!
