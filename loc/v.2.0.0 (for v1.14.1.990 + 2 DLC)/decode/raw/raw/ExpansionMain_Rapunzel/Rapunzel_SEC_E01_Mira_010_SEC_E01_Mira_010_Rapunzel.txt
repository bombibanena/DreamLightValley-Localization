Hey, Rapunzel! You've spent a lot of time in the Wild Tangle...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
And you seem to have befriended a few of the capybaras. Remember when we made a house for them?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Yes! They are so cute. I've been trying to come up with names for all of them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Pascal!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maximus!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eugene!

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
How funny that you said that because I already have a very good friend named Pascal!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Great tip! I'll try feeding them some <ActivityItem>Cabbage</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
But I'm guessing you didn't come by just to help me name the capybaras?

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Actually, I'm trying to help Mirabel with something.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Mirabel is so much fun! I was just talking with her about what it was like to grow up in a house with so many family members instead of... well, you know...

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
But never mind that... What do you need my help with?

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Did you ever figure out what the capybara's favorite food is?

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Ooh! Yes!

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
I tried feeding them all sorts of things...

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
...but what they love most is <ActivityItem>Cabbage</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
How funny that you said that because I recently made a new friend named Maximus!

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Ha-ha! Eugene would be a PERFECT name for a capybara!

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Have you gotten to know the <ActivityItem>Capybaras</ActivityItem> around here?
