{PlayerName}, I have a really important question for you... Have you ever had BREAD?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You've never had bread before?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's talk about bread later...

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Oh, I have â but only the ones I could make in the tower. And they're kind of... heavy.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I just had a baguette with fresh butter at Chez Remy and it was... it was... life-changing!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
And before that, EVE and I went dune surfing. She mostly floated along beside me but it was so THRILLING. I can't believe this is my life!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds like a great day!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Dune surfing sounds dangerous!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Did you yell "cowabunga"?

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
It's a dream come true. Everything in the Valley is!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Everyone in the Valley has been so kind to me; helping me realize my dreams. So, I was hoping to make some of THEIR dreams come true.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Could you help me with that? You know everyone here.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
So thoughtful! I'm in.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Did you have Villagers in mind?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Can we call ourselves "Dreams On Us"?

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Oh, I knew I could count on you!

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Could you talk to Remy? He wasn't his usual happy self today. Maybe if we help him achieve a dream, it might cheer him up.

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
<Lore>Talk to Remy</Lore>? You've got it!

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
Great! While you do that, I'm gonna see who else in the Village might have a dream we can help make come true...

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Well, I know who I want to start with.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
That is the PERFECT name for us.

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Okay, Dreams On Us friend! Where should we start?

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Oh, EVE would never let me fall!

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
It was a total dream... Which actually is why I wanted to talk to you.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Cows-a-what...? What does that mean?

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
It's something surfers like to yell when they catch a wave. I think that's mostly on water, though.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
You can surf on WATER?! I'll add that to my dream list! Which is actually what I wanted to talk to you about.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Oh, okay! I'll probably be at Chez Remy. Talk to you soon.
