I guess that's true... Is there one you wanted to ask about specifically?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Baking and cooking.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Knitting and sewing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Something else...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Well, I love making all sorts of treats.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
I even started inventing my own secret recipes!

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Yes! I especially love making clothes for my friend Pascal... He's a chameleon.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
He looks so cute in little dresses. And he's surprisingly patient during fittings.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Playing guitar.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Playing darts.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Something else...

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Ooh, I love playing music. How about you, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Does that strike a chord with you?

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Well, I haven't played darts in a while...

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
You always win when you play alone. It starts to feel a little pointless.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Papier-mÃ¢chÃ©.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Ventriloquism.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Another hobby...

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Well, I like to make sculptures out of fabric or paper and glue.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
It's a little tough to learn... You really have to stick to it.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Oh... Ventriloquy is something I practice with Pascal. I'm getting pretty good but...

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
You didn't hear that from me!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Pottery.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Candle making.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Something else?

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I love working with clay; it's so calming.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
I think everyone should take a pottery wheel for a spin.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Candle making is actually a very practical way to pass the time. I use what I make in the tower for light.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
You could say learning to do it was one of my brighter ideas.

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Well, I'm sure I'll find some new hobbies here in the Valley. *gasp* Maybe sailing on the boats I see out on the water!
