I love it! Every time I turn, I see something new.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
I've learned so much since I started exploring here.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Do you like exploring, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I love adventure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Only with my friends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'd rather stay at home.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Me too! I used to dream about adventure, but I was also kind of scared of it at the same time.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Now I'm excited to find new adventures every day!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Huh. I guess now that I think about it, there is a difference. The first time I went exploring was with Eugene, and I was really glad he was there.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Now, I'm more comfortable having adventures on my own. But I don't always want to be alone. That's why I'm so happy you found me!

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
I understand. Sometimes the world seems pretty big and a little overwhelming, huh?

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
I'm glad you have a place where you can feel safe and rest.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
But I want you to know, if you ever want an adventure buddy, I'd love to join you.
