{PlayerName}, I could really use your help with something...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
If you found out someone you cared about had lied to you... but they did it to keep you safe...

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
But then you ALSO found out the world's not as bad as they made it seem â it's actually pretty wonderful...

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Would you forgive them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Only if they apologize.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd talk to them about it first.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No. Grudges forever!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Oh. But what if... what if they won't say they're sorry?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Then you don't have to forgive them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't know! This seems complicated!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Hmm... That seems like it could be... difficult.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
I just want her to see my side of things.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Guess I have some more thinking to do about this.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Right? I don't know either!

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
That's a good idea. I wonder if Mother â err... that person... would explain everything.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Only one way to find out!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I know you're talking about Mother Gothel.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
You're right! I should talk to her... soon. Not now.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
AFTER I figure out what to say.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
I guess it's kind of obvious, huh?

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
And Mother's reasonable, right? I'm sure she'd explain herself... and then I could forgive her. At least, I hope that's what would happen.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
That doesn't seem like it would help the situation.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
You're right. Forgiveness is important.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I said what I said!

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
I think so too. That's why I can't stop thinking about this.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
I guess I do need to talk to her. Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Well... that doesn't feel quite right for me.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
But thank you for listening.
