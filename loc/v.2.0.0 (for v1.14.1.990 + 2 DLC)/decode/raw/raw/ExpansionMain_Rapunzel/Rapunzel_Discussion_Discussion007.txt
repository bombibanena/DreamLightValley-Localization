Well, I read all the books in the tower I grew up in over 400 times each.

Of course, I only had three. About cooking, geology, and botany.

Geology?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Cooking?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Botany?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Yes! Did you know some rocks are made from tiny grains of sand being pressed together for a long time?

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Which is even more amazing now that I've actually seen sand!

Mm-hmm, that's where I found my favorite recipe ever: hazelnut soup!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Yes. I read all about how plants can be used in medicines, which plants like which seasons, how to care for them...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
And I dreamed that someday I could see all the amazing plants I've read about.
