Oh, I guess you caught me daydreaming.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Do you ever daydream, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I daydream about romance.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I daydream about adventures.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I daydream about being famous.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
A daydream about finding a special someone? That sounds really nice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Do YOU have a special someone?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Love stories are the best stories!

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Me? A special someone? Like aâ

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
No, no, of course not.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Well... maybe? I did have a friend for a short while; he had nice hair and this goofy smolder...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
But I don't think heâ? I don't knowâ

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
He... left. And I haven't seen him in a long time.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Mother used to tell me stories, but never ones about romance.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Most of her stories were either scary or about people who were alone like us.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
But since you recommend it, I'll definitely ask Merlin if he has any love stories in his library that I can read.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Those are my favorite daydreams too!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Exploring, running free over the grass and under the biggest, bluest sky I've ever seen! I've done a little of that but not nearly enough.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
We'll make those daydreams come true!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Everything's an adventure to you.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I couldn't ask for a better adventuring friend than you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Oh, and just so you know, I'm ready whenever you are!

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
I guess it is.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
When everything's new, everything's... amazing!

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Well, that seems like it's coming true. Everyone in the Valley knows you!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
That's not "famous"; that's having lots of friends.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
You're right! I'm kind of a big deal.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Well, when you say it like that...

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Having good friends seems even BETTER than being famous!

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
You really are. Everyone around here looks up to you!

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
Gaston is like that too â he told me so.
