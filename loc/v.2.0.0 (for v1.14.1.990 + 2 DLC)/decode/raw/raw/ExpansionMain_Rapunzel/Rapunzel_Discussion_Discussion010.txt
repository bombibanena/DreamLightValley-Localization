Me? Well, I used to be afraid of lots of things...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Mostly because Mother was so worried I'd get hurt if I left the tower.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
But I was probably most scared of quicksand... men with scary teeth... and rhinos.

Quicksand?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Men with scary teeth?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Rhinos?

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Yes! Mother said there's some on Eternity Isle, and it will swallow me up in a second.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I think Mother Gothel exaggerated.

Are you going to face your fears?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Fear can be helpful.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
You're probably right. The more time I spend outside, the more I'm realizing that.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Now I know to look into things for myself.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
I am. Ever since the first time I left the tower I grew up in, I've been learning that what Mother said isn't always true.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
And I know that I'm stronger and braver than she ever thought I could be.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
I suppose that's true. It does keep us safe from things that are actually dangerous.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
But it can also keep us from chasing our dreams. I'm never going to let that happen to me again.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Yes... Mother said they'd bite me with sharp, gnashing teeth, but...

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
I've met several men now and that definitely didn't happen.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Yes. Mother said a rhino is a huge creature, as tall as the tower. With a metal horn like a sword, and heavy feet to trample you.
