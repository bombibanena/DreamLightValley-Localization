{PlayerName}, could I ask you something? It's about the tower...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is it sand-haunted again?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Now isn't the best time.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Oh no, it's nothing like that. It's just...

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
When we found the Jewel of Time there, it was the first time I'd visited the tower in months. And I think I sort of... miss it. Not that I miss being stuck there. I just miss being able to be there.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
And you see, the thing is... it's kind of a mess from all the time magic. So, I was sort of hopingyoucouldhelpmefixit?!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Help you fix it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'd love to!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You seem nervous. You okay?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Of course. The tower's a terror!

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Really? That would be amazing!

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
I'm always here to help, Rapunzel.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Let's go have a look at what needs to be done.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Okay â yes! Follow me!

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Oh? I'm fine. I guess I was just waiting for you to cut me off or say "no." Mother does that a lot.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
You never have to be nervous to ask me for help, okay?

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Thank you. I'll remember that.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Well, I didn't think it was THAT bad.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
But I guess it is crumbling and filled with enchanted sand and covered in vines, so...

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I agree there's room for improvement.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Oh! Okay, we can talk about it later. Bye!
