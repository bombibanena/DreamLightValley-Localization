{PlayerName}, I'm so glad you're here! I want to do something fun for the Village, and I really think you're gonna like it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I like fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hold on to that idea â we'll talk soon!

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Yay! Okay, here goes...

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
I want to host a painting class in the tower!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's the best idea I've ever heard!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Have you ever had tower guests before?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm not very artistic...

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
You're an amazing artist, Rapunzel. You'll definitely teach the Villagers a lot!

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Do you need help? I plan lots of parties around here. I could hand out invitations or decorate.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Actually, instead of invitations, I want to put up this special banner. That way, everyone feels welcome!

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Could you <Lore>put the banner up somewhere in the Village where everyone can see it</Lore>?

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
It's as good as done. What else?

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Well, I think I need to tidy up a bit, find more easels, plus make all the paints... And oh, of course, collect materials for the paints first...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Are you taking on too much?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I can help with that!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Why not buy paint?

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
No. No? I don't think so?

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
I mean, I am excited...

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Let me grab the paint supplies... What do you need?

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
I've made a list. Some flowers, some rocks, some fruit... If you could get them and bring them to me, I'll get started on the paints.

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
Okay! So I'll <Lore>put up the invitation banner in the Village</Lore> and <Lore>collect all your paint materials</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}! This is going to be the best! Class! Ever!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Would you? That would be amazing!

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
You can BUY paint?!

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Sure, different kinds of paint... Different colors...

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
That's amazing! But... since this is my first class, I'd really be more comfortable making them myself, like I always have.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Besides Eugene, no, but I can't wait to! I've always dreamt of painting with company.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Don't worry! Painting's a skill you just have to practice. I'll teach you.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Okay, I'll see you later!
