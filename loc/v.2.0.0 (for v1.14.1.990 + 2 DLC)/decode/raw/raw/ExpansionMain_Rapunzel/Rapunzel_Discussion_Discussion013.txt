Yes. I met him when I left the Eternity Isle tower to search for Mother.

What did you think of him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Gaston was the FIRST PERSON YOU EVER MET?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Isn't he amazing?

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
He seems... nice. But a little lonely. He was building himself pretend friends out of coconuts.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Right...

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
He kept insisting that he could protect me. But I knew I could do things on my own.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
So I went back to the jungle.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
What? No. There was always Mother. And Eugene...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
And the friends I made at the Snuggly Duckling.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
I had no idea there were so many nice people in the world!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
He is very confident!

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
He told me SO much about himself.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Oh, and he really likes eggs!
