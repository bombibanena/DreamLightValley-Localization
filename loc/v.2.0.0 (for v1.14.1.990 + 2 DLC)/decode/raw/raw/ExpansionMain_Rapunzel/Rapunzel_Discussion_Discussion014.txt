Hmm... I don't think I've ever met an animal I haven't loved.

But I guess I DO have a soft spot for Pascal, my chameleon friend.

Have you ever met a chameleon before?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, and it was amazing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, they're too good at hiding!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I like horses better.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Right? They make the BEST best friends.

Pascal lets me sew him dresses, and we play chess and hide-and-seek every day!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Well, they are VERY good at that.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Especially during games of hide-and-seek.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Horses are so nice!

I know an absolute sweetheart horse named Maximus. He doesn't warm to everyone immediately, but he has a wonderful heart.
