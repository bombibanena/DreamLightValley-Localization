Hi Rapunzel! Gaston and I found a brush. Any chance that it belongs to you? It's got long, bleached hair...

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Hmm...

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Let me think...

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
... I used my brushes this morning, and I wasn't missing one.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
I'd remember, since I brush my hair A LOT.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Oh no! I thought it would definitely be yours.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Was the hair straight or wiry?

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Hmmm... Now that you mention it, kind of wiry...
