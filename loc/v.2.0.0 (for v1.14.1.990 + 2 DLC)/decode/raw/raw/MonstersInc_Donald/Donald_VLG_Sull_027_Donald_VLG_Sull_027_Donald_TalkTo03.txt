There you are! Great job on Dazzle Beach, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm happy to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you need anything else?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You left me with the hardest part of the job!

TAG: Donald_001_f
And that's why you're everyone's favorite friend.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Now, could you please bring this <ActivityItem>Photo</ActivityItem> to Sulley?

TAG: Donald_007_f
...

TAG: Donald_008_f
Donald... Did you modify this <ActivityItem>Photo</ActivityItem>? There was not that much trash on the Beach...

TAG: Donald_009_f
Um... You noticed that, huh? But I had a good reason!

TAG: Donald_010_f
I had to make the trash more noticeable for Sulley. Otherwise it might've looked like I was just hanging out on the Beach getting my photo taken.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I guess you have a point...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's your decision.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I need to see how this is going to go.

TAG: Donald_011_f
Phew!

TAG: Donald_014_f
Now, please bring the <ActivityItem>Photo</ActivityItem> to Sulley, so he can see my project for himself.

TAG: Donald_012_f
It sure is!

TAG: Donald_013_f
With me named Villager of the Month, that's how!

TAG: Donald_002_f
Yeah, could you please bring this <ActivityItem>Photo</ActivityItem> to Sulley?

TAG: Donald_003_f
That's not true!

TAG: Donald_004_f
You just had to pick up some trash while I was getting this <ActivityItem>Photo</ActivityItem> ready.
