Hey there, {PlayerName}. So... uh... where's the winner?

TAG: Player_000_f
Vanellope thinks I should be the one crowned winner...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Isn't she the nicest?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't know how to feel about that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
And she's RIGHT.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Yeah, she's a great kid.

TAG: Sully_006_f
And she has a point. Both Stitch and Olaf came to tell me that you were a huge help.

TAG: Sully_000_f
So congratulations, {PlayerName}. You win the scavenger hunt!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Wow, thank you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Did I win anything?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That was too easy.

TAG: Sully_001_f
Hey, you earned it.

TAG: Sully_012_f
And those three seem to be having a good time together.

TAG: Sully_007_f
I think they're working on an arts and crafts project now.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Vanellope said it was top secret, but could ya go check in with her?

TAG: Sully_009_f
Between her and Stitch, it could be crafts or calamity.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Your reward is: the fun you had along the way!

TAG: Sully_011_f
And still too hard for most of the contestants...

TAG: Sully_013_f
Seems they've moved on to a different kind of fun anyway.

TAG: Sully_004_f
Be happy. She's a great kid. Plus, she likes you a lot.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Wow... Okay. Glad you agree with her.
