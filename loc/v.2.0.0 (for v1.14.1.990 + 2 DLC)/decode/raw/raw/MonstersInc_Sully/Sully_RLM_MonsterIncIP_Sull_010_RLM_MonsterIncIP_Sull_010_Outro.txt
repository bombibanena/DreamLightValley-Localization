Whew. Hey {PlayerName}, thanks for all your help rescuing Mike. Things got a little hairy there.

TAG: Sully_003_f
It sure took it outta me. After everything required to get the factory switched over to laugh power and now THIS, I could use a vacation.

TAG: Sully_020_f
Ya know, not all monsters could handle themselves under pressure like that.

TAG: Sully_021_f
Uh...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm not a monster.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sulley, don't freak out but...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I need to tell you something...

TAG: Sully_005_f
I'm a human in disguise.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Sorry, what?!

TAG: Player_001_f
I didn't want to trick you...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It was the only way onto the Laugh Floor.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I was worried you would get upset.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm just a human-y human!

TAG: Sully_009_f
Huh... You must be a pretty special human to trick our security gate.

TAG: Sully_011_f
So uh... Why are you here?

TAG: Sully_013_f
To invite you to visit Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Sully_006_f
Dreamlight Valley? Never heard of it.

TAG: Sully_012_f
It's where I came from. Actually, it would be a great vacation spot for you!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
The Villagers are friendly.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
There's lots to explore.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
There's no work and NO paperwork.

TAG: Sully_015_f
Ya have to love a place where the locals are friendly...

TAG: Sully_017_f
Hmm... hearing "Dreamlight Valley" does give me a familiar, warm feeling...

TAG: Sully_002_f
Tell ya what, {PlayerName}: I'm pretty sold on this idea. I really need a break, but I can't go without Mike.

TAG: Sully_018_f
If you can convince him to join me, we'll come visit the Valley.

TAG: Sully_019_f
Should be an easy pitch â you did rescue him after all.

TAG: Sully_001_f
All right, I'll <Lore>talk to Mike</Lore>.

TAG: Sully_014_f
Sounds like a great way to stay active...

TAG: Sully_016_f
Well... That does sound pretty great...

TAG: Sully_008_f
I'm not upset. I know humans. Well, I know one tiny human â my friend Boo.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Well, you sure had me fooled.
