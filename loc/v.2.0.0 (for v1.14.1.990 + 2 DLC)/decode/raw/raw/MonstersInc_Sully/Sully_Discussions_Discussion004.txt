I was just thinkin' about some of the ways humans and monsters are alike. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes, just like you humans.

Yes, humans are pretty unique!

Most of us don't have fangs or slime though.

I didn't know that about monsters. Cool.

I'm sure it's the same where you're from, but Monstropolis works hard to make sure it's accessible to all monsters.

The city had a big initiative back when I was a kid â ramps for slug monsters.

Different sized doors for tiny monsters. Good stuff like that.

Huh, well. Maybe some day.

It is! We're all different from each other, but we're still the same. It's great!
