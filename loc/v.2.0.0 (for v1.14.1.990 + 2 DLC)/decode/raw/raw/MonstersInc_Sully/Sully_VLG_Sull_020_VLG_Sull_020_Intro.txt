Hey, {PlayerName}, I've got an idea for the Village. Got some time to talk?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Tell me everything.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Too busy, sorry!

TAG: Sully_001_f
Well, first off â Dreamlight Valley's amazing! What you've built here is great. And I think I've got an idea that could make it even better.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm glad you like it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Everything can always be better!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
So, it's not good enough as it is?

TAG: Sully_004_f
I can tell you've put a ton of work in, but you shouldn't be the only one doing that.

TAG: Sully_007_f
I wanna encourage other Villagers to help out more in Valley improvements.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Okay... what are you thinking?

TAG: Sully_009_f
Monsters, Inc. has this "Jokester of the Month" award. So, I was thinking there could be a Villager of the Month award here!

TAG: Sully_010_f
Folks would win by making real positive changes for the Valley. What do ya think?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I love that idea.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm willing to give it a try.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Couldn't it be kind of competitive in a bad way?

TAG: Sully_011_f
Great! Because uh... I kinda already started to organize it.

TAG: Sully_015_f
Three Villagers told me they have ideas for their own projects: Mike, Ursula, and Donald.

TAG: Sully_012_f
Really? What are their projects?

TAG: Sully_016_f
I don't know yet. I told 'em that I wanted to be an impartial judge. But I'm kinda worried. Could ya go check on 'em? Maybe help 'em out if they need it?

TAG: Sully_003_f
It'll give you the perfect opportunity to see if this works.

TAG: Sully_017_f
Sure! I'll check on <Lore>Ursula, Donald, and Mike's community projects.</Lore>

TAG: Sully_018_f
Great! Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Sully_013_f
Gee, I hope not. My plan is to make sure it's about folks doin' good in the Village â not chasing the award.

TAG: Sully_014_f
I'd still like to see a trial run before deciding.

TAG: Sully_005_f
I'm glad you think so too, but you're already doing so much for the Valley...

TAG: Sully_006_f
No! No! That's not what I'm sayin'! It's just that you work so hard for the Valley, and I don't think you need to do it alone.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Okay, whenever you have a moment then.
