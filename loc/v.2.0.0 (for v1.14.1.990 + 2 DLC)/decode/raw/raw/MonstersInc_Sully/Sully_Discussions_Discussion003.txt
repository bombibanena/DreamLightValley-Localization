Great! I really like getting to know everybody.

I was talkin' to Kristoff earlier â he'd never heard of electrical power plants!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We all come from different worlds.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Kristoff doesn't need electricity â he has reindeer!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What is this el-eck-tri-cul you speak of?

TAG: Sully_002_f
Yeah. And it's wild just how different those worlds can be.

TAG: Sully_003_f
That just means there's more we can learn from each other.

TAG: Sully_004_f
Which is great, right?

TAG: Sully_005_f
Not really the same, but I get your point.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'd stick with the reindeer.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'd trade the reindeer for electricity in a heartbeat.

TAG: Sully_006_f
Yeah, they are kinda cute... AND they smell great!

TAG: Sully_007_f
Yeah, me too. Don't think a reindeer would help power the blender for my morning smoothie.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Heh, you too? You come from a cold climate with ice magic and no electrical power?

TAG: Sully_009_f
Oh, totally. The Abominable Snowman was my neighbor â we'd have snow sculpture contests.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Hey, I know that guy! He's pretty cool... Pun not intended.
