Hey, {PlayerName}! What brings you by?

TAG: Sully_001_f
Well, not that I wouldn't just want to chat...

TAG: Sully_002_f
...but I'm here about Vanellope.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Uh-oh, what did she do now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She's in big trouble!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Actually, it's a good thing.

TAG: Sully_004_f
*sigh* ... I probably should've seen this coming.

TAG: Sully_017_f
Isn't it?

TAG: Sully_018_f
Oh! What about some comedy props?

TAG: Sully_019_f
There's a ton back at the office just sitting around now that Mike's taking a break from teaching his comedy classes.

TAG: Sully_020_f
Great! What kind of props?

TAG: Sully_021_f
Let's see... there's definitely a <ActivityItem>Rubber Chicken</ActivityItem> and a <ActivityItem>Whoopee Cushion</ActivityItem> that you could grab.

TAG: Sully_022_f
And if I were you, I'd try to grab a <ActivityItem>Laugh Canister</ActivityItem> while you're there.

TAG: Sully_023_f
Oh? Why?

TAG: Sully_024_f
Well, if I know Mike, he's got some other plans up his sleeve.

TAG: Sully_025_f
But he doesn't always communicate them at the right time, which is one of the reasons why I'm the CEO.

TAG: Sully_026_f
Ha, got it!

TAG: Sully_005_f
Let me grab my checkbook. What did she break this time?

TAG: Sully_006_f
Nothing! Unless you count the jokes she's always cracking.

TAG: Sully_011_f
Phew! That's a relief.

TAG: Sully_012_f
Mike and I want to get her something to welcome her to the world of comedy.

TAG: Sully_013_f
Any ideas of something that would be up her alley?

TAG: Sully_014_f
Hmm... good question.

TAG: Sully_015_f
Off the bat, I'm thinkin' something from back home. I've been telling Vanellope stories about the other monsters, and she just LOVES 'em.

TAG: Sully_016_f
That's pretty cute.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Well, that's a relief!

TAG: Sully_008_f
Vanellope's a supersweet kid, but she's definitely got a troublemaker streak in her.

TAG: Sully_009_f
Well, this is kinda related, I guess.

TAG: Sully_010_f
But you'll be pleased to hear that she's channeling her mischievous intentions into comedy.
