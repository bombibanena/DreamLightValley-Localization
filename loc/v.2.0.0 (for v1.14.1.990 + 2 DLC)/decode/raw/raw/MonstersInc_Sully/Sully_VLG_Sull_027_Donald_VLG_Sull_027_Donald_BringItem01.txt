Um... Is that Donald posing on the Beach with a bunch of... digitally-added trash?

TAG: Player_000_f
Not all the trash was fake...

He cleaned up all of the real trash.

He cleaned up some.

He made me do most of the work.

Wow, I'm impressed. But ya know, with this touched-up photo, I'm not sure that he understood the point of the contest.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Thanks for helping him, {PlayerName}. It's great how you're always there for folks.

Some is better than none, I guess. But this photo makes me feel like he missed the point of Villager of the Month...

TAG: Sully_005_f
That's not good. Guess he doesn't understand the spirit of Villager of the Month.
