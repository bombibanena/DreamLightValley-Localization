Hey, {PlayerName}, the place looks great! Nice work!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was surprisingly easy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's my next intern duty?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
So. Much. Slime.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Glad to hear it wasn't too much trouble.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Next up: Would ya mind fixing a coffee for me and Mike?

TAG: Sully_006_f
Normally, I'd grab it myself, but we're ALMOST done with the plan to get this place up and running.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Now we're talking REAL intern stuff!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What do Monsters, Inc. employees like in their coffee?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
This is a waste of my talents.

TAG: Sully_011_f
Ha-ha! You're tellin' me!

TAG: Sully_014_f
I delivered my share of coffee around this place back in the day.

TAG: Sully_015_f
Anyway, it's not a good idea to approach Mike until he's had his morning brew. And I think the extra caffeine boost will help us finish the plan!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
So relatable! What do you need?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What're your coffee orders?

TAG: Sully_016_f
I like my coffee <Lore>extra strong</Lore>. It takes about <Lore>five times the amount of a regular coffee</Lore> to get it as bitter as I like it.

TAG: Sully_017_f
Mike takes his with <Lore>a little non-dairy screamer</Lore> and <Lore>as much sugar as you can add</Lore>. He calls it "The Wazowski Special."

TAG: Sully_018_f
And hey, I think a delivery of supplies just arrived. Everything you need is <Lore>over at the coffee station in Reception</Lore>.

TAG: Sully_001_f
When you've made 'em, would ya mind <Lore>bringing the coffees to Mike</Lore>? He needs his more urgently than I do.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Sully_010_f
In my experience, no two coffee orders are alike.

TAG: Sully_013_f
Look, I know it's not as glamorous as being a Jokester. Trust me.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Well, I did have something in mind...

TAG: Sully_004_f
Trust me; I know! When Chalooby does the Mollusk Mambo, the floor's always like a skating rink.
