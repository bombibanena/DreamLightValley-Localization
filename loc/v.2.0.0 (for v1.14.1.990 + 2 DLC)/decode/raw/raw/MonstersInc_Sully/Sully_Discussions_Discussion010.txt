Uh, well... clothing's pretty optional for monsters. But when I became management, I did try wearing a tie.

TAG: Sully_001_f
I was never really sure which color, though.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Red.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Blue.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Green.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Yeah? I've heard red's a power color. Makes an impact.

TAG: Sully_003_f
I'll have to give it a try.

TAG: Sully_004_f
Oh, but what about for formal occasions?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Black tie â no contest.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm always a fan of the bow tie.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Bolo tie!

TAG: Sully_005_f
True â that's a classic.

TAG: Sully_006_f
Hmm, I could do a bow tie...

TAG: Sully_007_f
Wild card! You think I could pull that off?

TAG: Sully_008_f
Are you sure? I'm worried it'll blend in too much with my fur.

TAG: Sully_009_f
But maybe a dark blue... Thanks!

TAG: Sully_010_f
Heh! Then Mike and I could match. I'll have to try it.
