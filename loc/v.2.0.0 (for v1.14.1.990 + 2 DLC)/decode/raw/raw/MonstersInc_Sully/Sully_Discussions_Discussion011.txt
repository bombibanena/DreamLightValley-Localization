A ton! But... uh, one main one... You seem to be in charge of running things here...

TAG: Sully_001_f
Does that feel like a lot of responsibility?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Mainly it's just a lot of fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yes, I take it seriously.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eh, I don't think about it too much.

TAG: Sully_002_f
I bet it is. You got a favorite thing to do?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Landscaping!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Building the most efficient Village possible.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Pranking Donald!

TAG: Sully_003_f
You do make things look good. Really good!

TAG: Sully_004_f
Efficiency, huh? We could use you at Monsters, Inc.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Ha! He does seem to have a really short fuse.

TAG: Sully_006_f
I get that. Hey, but don't forget to have fun every now and again.

TAG: Sully_007_f
You can always hang out with Mike and me if you wanna blow off a little steam.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Really? Okay... So, you never thought about taking a more serious management approach?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You have a point.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What do you think might happen?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
It's DREAMLIGHT VALLEY. Not RESPONSIBILITY CITY.

TAG: Sully_009_f
I don't wanna mess with your style. Just might be something to consider.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Oh, I don't know. Seems like keeping the villains in check is no laughing matter. But hey, what do I know? Things here are pretty great!

TAG: Sully_011_f
Ha-ha, you got me there! I guess it's important not to take anything TOO seriously.
