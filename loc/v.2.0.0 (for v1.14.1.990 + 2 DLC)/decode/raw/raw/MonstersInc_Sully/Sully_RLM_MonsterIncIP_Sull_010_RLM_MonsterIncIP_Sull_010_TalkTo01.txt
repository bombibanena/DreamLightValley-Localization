Hey there! You must be the intern we've been waiting for!

TAG: Sully_015_f
You picked a strange day to show up, though, because... uh â nobody else did. We have no idea where everybody is!

TAG: Sully_016_f
And we're in a real tight jam. Monstropolis needs power, but this is not a two-monster operation.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
How about a THREE-monster operation?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Seems like you need some extra hands.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
So unprofessional. What kind of company is this?

TAG: Sully_019_f
Well, usually it takes dozens of monsters to keep this place running... Did I mention that I'm glad you're here?

TAG: Sully_021_f
Look at it this way: You're gonna get some hands-on experience on a Laugh Floor your very first day.

TAG: Sully_023_f
Ya know... I don't mean to be rude but, uh, you're a little human-shaped. I've never seen a monster like you before.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
I retracted my extra arms before work.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Human-shaped? Ha! I get that all the time!

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Inappropriate! I'm calling Monster Resources!

TAG: Sully_025_f
Oh, okay. No need to explain.

TAG: Sully_028_f
It's just that it's company policy. No humans on the Laugh Floor.

TAG: Sully_027_f
If human adults knew about us, it'd be... Sheesh, I don't even wanna think about it.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Well, welcome to the company!

TAG: Sully_001_f
I'm James P. Sullivan, CEO... But please, call me Sulley. And over there? That's Mike Wazowski.

TAG: Player_000_f
I'm {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I can't wait to start my internship!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can I call him Mikey?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm DEFINITELY a monster, not a human.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Gotta love that go-getter attitude!

TAG: Sully_005_f
Why don't we get you started while Mike and I figure out how to run this place with just three monsters.

TAG: Sully_029_f
We had our Laugh Power launch party a couple days ago and this Laugh Floor needs a little work.

TAG: Sully_006_f
We already swept up all the confetti and took down the decorations. Could you <Lore>clean up the rest of the party trash</Lore> and <Lore>rinse away the slug slime on the floor</Lore>?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll get started right away!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
... Slug slime?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You want me to pick up trash?

TAG: Sully_009_f
Great! I appreciate that positive attitude, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Sully_011_f
I'm sure there's something around here that can help ya <Lore>rinse the slime away</Lore>.

TAG: Sully_014_f
Don't worry! I've got my own tools.

TAG: Sully_013_f
Nice! Well, come back and see me when you're finished.

TAG: Sully_008_f
You bet. Those slugs know how to dance but... Phew, it really leaves a trail.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Hey, everybody starts somewhere. Mike and I worked our way up from the mail room.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Uh... If you want my advice, call him "Mr. Wazowski" until he tells you otherwise. Mike'll like it if you make him feel like a big deal.

TAG: Sully_004_f
Right! Okay. Great. Although it's kind of weird you felt the need to reiterate that.

TAG: Sully_024_f
Do you? That's uh... that's a relief.

TAG: Sully_026_f
Wait! No! I can explain.

TAG: Sully_018_f
No kidding. I was kinda hoping you'd have eight arms.

TAG: Sully_020_f
Trust me: This has never happened before. We are the best of the best.
