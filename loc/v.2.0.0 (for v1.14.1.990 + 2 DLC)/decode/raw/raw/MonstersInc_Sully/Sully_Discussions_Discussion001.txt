Hey, {PlayerName}. You ever think about how much things can change?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sometimes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Never.

TAG: Sully_001_f
Then you'll understand. See... I used to be Monsters, Inc.'s top Scarer.

TAG: Sully_002_f
But now we're all about making kids laugh. And don't get me wrong: I'm happy about that! It's much better!

TAG: Sully_003_f
It's just... I spent my whole life training to be scary. And now that's not needed. Makes ya think...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Time to learn something new!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Your job isn't who you are.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Yeah, change is scary.

TAG: Sully_004_f
You're right. This old monster just needs to learn some new tricks. I've heard golf's relaxing... Hey, thanks for talkin'.

TAG: Sully_005_f
You've got a good point. Even if I'm not top Scarer, I'm still Mike's best friend and Boo's kitty.

TAG: Sully_006_f
And those are some of the best things in the world.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Maybe scarier than I ever was! But hey, it's an important part of life, too.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Really? Wow. I guess you're good at keeping up with things.

TAG: Sully_009_f
What's your secret?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm always learning.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I do what I love.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm just awesome.

TAG: Sully_010_f
That's pretty admirable. Heh â maybe I could learn something from you!

TAG: Sully_011_f
Ha! Well, I guess that's one way to stay relevant. Awesome is always in demand.
