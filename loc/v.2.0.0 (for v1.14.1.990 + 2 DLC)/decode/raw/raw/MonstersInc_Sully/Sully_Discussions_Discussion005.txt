Oh yeah. In fact, ya know how in the Dream Castle there are those doors leading to different places?

TAG: Sully_001_f
They kinda remind me of the doors on our Laugh Floor.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They are kind of similar.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's a little different though.

TAG: Sully_002_f
That's what I thought. Not exactly the same...

TAG: Sully_003_f
But walking around there feels sorta familiar.

TAG: Sully_004_f
You're right. Our doors just go to the human world.

But in the Castle, every door goes to a different world!
