Okay, stay calm! It's only a... small... emergency!

TAG: Sully_003_f
The door powered down, and Mike's stuck in the human world!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Don't panic. What do we do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is it time to freak out now?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The way he was talking, it seems like he can handle it.

TAG: Sully_005_f
You're right. Mike's countin' on us.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Since this is an emergency... we need the <ActivityItem>Emergency Manual</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Sully_010_f
MIFT usually keeps a copy of the <ActivityItem>Emergency Manual</ActivityItem> somewhere on each Laugh Floor. I need you to find it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What's a MIFT?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why do you think Mike's in danger?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'll find that manual right away!

TAG: Sully_013_f
Oh, MIFT is the Monsters, Incorporated Facilities Team.

TAG: Sully_001_f
They make sure everything here's in top condition.

TAG: Sully_015_f
It breaks? They fix it. But they're not here, so we need their manual to help us!

TAG: Sully_012_f
The longer Mike's behind that door, the higher the chance he'll be discovered.

TAG: Sully_017_f
Which could mean humans finding out about the monster world, which could then lead to a catastrophe!

TAG: Sully_011_f
He'll be the next Sasquatch, or Nessie, or Abominable Snowman!

TAG: Sully_018_f
Oh boy, I have gotta stop running worst-case scenarios and focus on getting him outta there.

TAG: Sully_014_f
Great! I'm gonna check out the electrical panel, see if I can get it working.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Remember: You're looking for the <Lore>Emergency Manual</Lore>!

TAG: Sully_004_f
Yes! I mean â no! No... We just have to figure this out.

TAG: Sully_006_f
What can I say? Mike's a genius Jokester, and he's not shy about it. But this has nothin' to do with collecting laughs.

TAG: Sully_009_f
We have to get him out of there!
