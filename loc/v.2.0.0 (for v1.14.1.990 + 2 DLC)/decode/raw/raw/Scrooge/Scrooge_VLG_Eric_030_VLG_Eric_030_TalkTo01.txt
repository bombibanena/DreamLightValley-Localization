Hello, {PlayerName}! And what brings you to see me today? A new business venture, perhaps?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Eric wants to take to the sea again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is it true that Eric used to bring Valley artifacts back from his travels?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I need some navigation maps now.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Aye, that's grand! It's good to see young people with an entrepreneurial spirit. Of course, he'll need updated maps...

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Hmmm... Oh! I've just the thing! Not long ago, I got new maps showing the waters all around the Valley.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Now, it's quite easy to get turned around out there on the high seas.

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Tell Eric these maps won't be much help if he hasn't got a reliable compass.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Aye, it is! I was afraid he wouldn't remember. A fine young man, Prince Eric.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
And a true adventurer too! He knows how to respect the sea. Of course, he'll need updated maps...

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
First, I dinnae like your tone. And second, I don't share maps with just anyone. What would you do with 'em? You're not a sailor, are ya?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
They're not for me. They're for Eric. He wants to take to the seas again.
