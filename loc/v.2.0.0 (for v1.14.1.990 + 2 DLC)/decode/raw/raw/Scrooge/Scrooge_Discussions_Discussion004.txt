I'm Scrooge McDuck! I made my fortune being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.

How tough were the toughies?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How smart were the smarties?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Never heard of you?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Oh, they were the toughest. Yukon miners and Beagle Boy bandits!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
But I out-hiked, out-swam, and out-explored them all!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Oh, they were the smartest. Cunning foxes and ruthless entrepreneurs.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
But I outfoxed the foxes and out-ruthed the ruthless.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Is "out-ruthed" a word? Well, if it is, I did it!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
No? Well then, can you show me to the rock you've been living under?

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I've made many a fortune exploring places remote and rarely traveled.
