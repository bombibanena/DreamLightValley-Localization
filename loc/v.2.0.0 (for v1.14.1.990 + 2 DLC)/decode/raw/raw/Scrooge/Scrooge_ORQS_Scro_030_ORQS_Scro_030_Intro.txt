The Forest of Valor could become a top-tier tourist destination, you know.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
But no one wants to hike in that Forest the way it looks at present.

I'll decorate it and make it a perfect place for...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...a nature hike.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...a romantic picnic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...watching all the birds and critters.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Aye, that's usin' your thinkin' cap! Some good signposts and hiking trails would make it much more inviting. Nothin' clears the mind like a good hike...

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
...as long as there's treasure to find at the end of it. Heh-heh-heh!

Well, I'm not much of a lovebird myself, but you'll never go wrong with a bit of romance in your marketing.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Now that's a grand idea! Why, if I had a dollar for every animal in that Forest...

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
...well, I'd be just a little bit richer than I already am, I suppose.
