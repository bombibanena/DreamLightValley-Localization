Greetings, {PlayerName}! Goodness, you look like you want to talk business.

TAG: Scrooge_019_f
I know you have a strange item called the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem> in your possession...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can I buy it from you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Would you spare it to help the Village?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Mother Gothel wants it, and I'm getting it for her.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Och, no need to pay, {PlayerName}. I'd consider parting with it in exchange for a wee favor.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
You might have noticed some unsavory characters lurking about the Village. I suspect they have sticky fingers.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
I must protect my shop from thieves. So I want to install something that records all the comings and goings.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
And I already have a design in mind. It looks like a plant with some very special fruit. I call it a <ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I love it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You don't seem like somebody who'd be into puns.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Boooooo!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Aye, you're a visionary, just like me, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Now, if you want the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem>, you know what to do.

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
The <ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem> should look like a potted plant. You'll need <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Soil</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
Also some <ActivityItem>Electronic Components</ActivityItem>. I'm sure you can find a box of them in WALLÂ·E's House.

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
Resourceful wee fella, that one.

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
Once it's made, place it in front of my shop. Then I'll give you the information you need.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Don't let my talents for business fool ya, {PlayerName}. I've a pheasant sense of humor. Hee-hee-hee!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Aye, you've no taste, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Aye, but first you'll have to start by helping me.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Helping villains now, are we? Well, {PlayerName}, it'll cost ya.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
No coins, but a wee favor.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Because of you, there are some unsavory characters lurking about the Village. I suspect they have sticky fingers.
