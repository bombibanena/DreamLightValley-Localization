{PlayerName}, you've got the look of someone who's about to ask me for a favor.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
It's not for me. It's for Donald. He needs help fixing his House.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Oh, so it's my loafer of a nephew who's lookin' for help, eh? And if I know Donald, he wants it for free. Why should I lose money in this venture?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Because he's family!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Because he's really mad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Because I won't stop bothering you until you do.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Bah! He may be family, but he treats me like his personal piggy bank.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Of course, he did do a fine thing to help the Valley... All right, I'll give ya something to help Donald. Here.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
What's this?

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
The blueprints for Donald's House. You'll need those if you're going to fix it.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
And that's not all. You'll need a <ActivityItem>Boat Repair Kit</ActivityItem>, too.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
How much are you going to make me pay for one of those...?

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Oh, I don't keep that sort of thing lyin' around. Wouldn't be profitable.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
You can make one yourself if you gather some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Rope</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
If I gave Donald free goods every time he got angry, I'd be penniless!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Hmm. Good point. Though you're a lot quieter about your botherin' than my nephew.
