Greetings, {PlayerName}! Looking for your next investment? Well, I have new deals every day!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Actually, I need your help. The Sunlit Plateau is littered with wildebeest bones...

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Ahh, and Scar asked you to fix it for him? Typical!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
You know, if you keep doin' every this and that for him, he'll never learn.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
It's the last time; I promise.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
You're helping me, not him.

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
I don't have a choice.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Well, fine. I know my business will profit greatly thanks to the new products from the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
But Scar needs to learn not to ruin everything and expect someone else to come and solve his problems for him.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Here, this <ActivityItem>Mold</ActivityItem> ought to make your Shovel strong enough to clear out the bones.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Wait... how does this work...? Do I need something else to put in it?

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Aye, that you will. But I'm not in the Shovel fixin' business. Maybe Scar can help you with the rest.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Ah, I suppose you're right. You're doing a favor for the Village, and my business will profit greatly thanks to the new products from the Sunlit Plateau.
