Aye, there you are! Now that my shop is up and running, it's time!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Time to do WHAT, you say? Well, to jumpstart the Village's economy, of course!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's not nice!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
OF COURSE!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No, thanks.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Hmph! Suit yourself. Make money by doin' all the work on your own, if that's the way you want it!
