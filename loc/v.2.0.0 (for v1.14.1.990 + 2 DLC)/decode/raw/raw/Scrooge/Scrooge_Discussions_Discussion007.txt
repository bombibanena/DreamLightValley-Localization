{PlayerName}, have you seen my nephew Donald?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I was just talking to him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I saw him a while ago.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Who?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Ah! Then he must be close by. Good. I need his help with something.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Could I help you instead?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Why Donald?

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
That's kind of you, but I need Donald for this. He knows just how I like the stock inventoried.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
And it's high time we did a little uncle-nephew bonding.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Oh, it's nothing urgent. Nothing Valley-shaking. I was just rather looking forward to some uncle-nephew bonding.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Well, he knows just how I like the stock inventoried. And we have some catching up to do.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
If you see him again, let him know I need his help with something.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
You haven't met? Oh, I thought you had.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
He's a keen lad. Useful in a pinch. Partial to wearing his sailor's uniform.
