Thank you kindly, {PlayerName}. Now, here's all you need to know to find the <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
I hid it away in the Village before the Forgetting. So, I'm not so clear on the details, but I trust you'll find it.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
I buried the scroll in a locked chest near a cave on Dazzle Beach, though I cannae remember which one.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
As for the key to open the chest, you'll have to fish that out from the pool in the Glade. The one with the ruins.

Happy searching, {PlayerName}! And thank you again for the <ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem>!
