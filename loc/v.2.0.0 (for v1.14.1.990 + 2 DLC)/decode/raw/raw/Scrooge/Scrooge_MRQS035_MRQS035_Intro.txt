{PlayerName}, I just looked at my quarterly profits. Och! It's a disaster! I'm completely ruined!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Calm down!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's wrong?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Uh... should I come back later?

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Calm down?! How dare you?! I've a right to be as upset as I'd like.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
The shop's open... but I've got no customers!

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
If I don't act fast, my fortune will be lost!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
What do you need?

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Well, first, we need a way to show the Villagers of Dreamlight Valley that Scrooge McDuck is open for business!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I could help you advertise!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Spread the word yourself.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
That'd be grand!

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
I'd do it myself, but when folks hear the name "Scrooge McDuck," they think "pillar of the community"!

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
I can't be seen around the Village like some kind of walking billboard!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Besides, that's why I've got you.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Put together an outfit to wear around the Village to promote my shop.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I'll do no such thing!

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
When folks hear the name "Scrooge McDuck," they think "pillar of the community"!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
A wee bit of everything at the moment!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
No, no! I need your help.
