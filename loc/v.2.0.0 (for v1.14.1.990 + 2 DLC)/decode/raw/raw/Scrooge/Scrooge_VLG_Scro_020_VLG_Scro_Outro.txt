TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Sparklin' spats, that's it! And in Scotland that would be 25-05. Now for the next clue... Take a bit o' fresh air in the Meadow and count the ponds.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
So how many ponds did you count in the Meadow?

That's right, 3! I hope the fresh air did ya some good... And finally, how many telescopes does one wizard need to study the stars?

Around 7.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Just 1 is enough.

Eureka! 25-05-3-1... That's my combination! So genius, NOBODY could guess it... even me!

Now, forget those numbers straightaway! I've got property to protect!

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
But I do want to thank ya. Now that I have access to my fortune, here's a wee gift.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
The Well doesn't count, {PlayerName}. How many is it, then?

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Well, ya obviously didn't go there! Take your best guess.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Nay... That's not it. Though the lad does frighten me sometimes.
