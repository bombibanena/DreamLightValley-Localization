Ah, {PlayerName}, you've finally come to apologize. After all, you were the one who helped that scheming sea witch steal from me.

TAG: Player_000_f
She'll give you back your voice...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She regrets her actions.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She doesn't want things to escalate.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You annoyed her into compliance.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
I should hope so!

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
To restore your voice, I'll need you to craft the first part of a musical line about yourself for the enchantment.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
And I suppose you'll add a rhyme to it?

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Yes, that's the idea.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Then I'll try not to make it too hard for you, dear. Hmm...

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Mother Gothel, a vision of beauty and grace...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Be careful or she'll put you in your place.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Watch out or she'll beat you in a race?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
And she has a few wrinkles on her face...

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Oh, I most certainly will.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Bravo, {PlayerName}!

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
That's all I need from you. Thanks!

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Oh, I had hoped you'd come up with something more inspired than that.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Well, I suppose it could be worse.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Only joking!

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Of course you are, dear. Because if you aren'tâ

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Or not.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
{PlayerName}, don't make me add you to my long list of those who vex me in this Village.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
In other words, she's afraid I might get my revenge. Good.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Annoyed her? Ha! She knows she's no match for me.
