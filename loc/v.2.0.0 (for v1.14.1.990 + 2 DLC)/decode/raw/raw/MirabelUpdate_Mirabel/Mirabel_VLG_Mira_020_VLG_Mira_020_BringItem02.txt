These look so good! Almost as good as the ones my mamÃ¡ makes. But there's only one way to know for sure.

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
We've gotta taste 'em!

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Â¡Delicioso! Sorry, I couldn't help myself. I ate almost the whole plate!

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
You must've found the recipe. And after tasting them, my memory of them is coming back!

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
It was pretty simple in the end: just <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Eggs</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Cheese</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Thank you so much! I never could've figured it out without you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sure you'd do fine.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Remy helped me, to be fair.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're lucky I'm around.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Well, thanks for believing in me, {PlayerName}.

You know what we should do? Make more <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem> and give them to the Villagers.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Like Mickey, Mr. McDuck, and Goofy. They stayed behind during the Forgetting. I'll bet they could really use some good, comforting, homemade <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
I'll bring them each a plate.

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
Okay... But you made them yourself!

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
We're all lucky. You always seem to know how to help.
