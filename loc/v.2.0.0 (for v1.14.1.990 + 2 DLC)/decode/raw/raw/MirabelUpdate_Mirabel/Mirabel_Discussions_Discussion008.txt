{PlayerName}, do you have any sisters?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, but I have other siblings.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm an only child.

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
And... do you get along?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
We do.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not really.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Sometimes.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
That's great. I've always gotten along with my sister Luisa.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Isabela on the other hand... We had a pretty rocky relationship for a long time, but we're doing really well now!

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
I understand. Siblings can be tough. They're always there, and they know just how to annoy you.

My sister Isabela and I had a rocky relationship for a while. But it's gotten a lot better.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
That's pretty normal, I think. Siblings can be a lot.

Really? Wow! With a family as large as mine, that takes a lot for me to imagine.
