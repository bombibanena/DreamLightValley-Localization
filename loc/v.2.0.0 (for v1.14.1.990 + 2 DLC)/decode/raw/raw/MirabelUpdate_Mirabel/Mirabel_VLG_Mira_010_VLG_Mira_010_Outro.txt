Amazing! {PlayerName}, this House shows that you don't always need actual magic to make magic happen.

Both our Houses are looking so much better. I'd say that's pretty impressive.

And now that Mini-Casita is fixed, I really want to make myself useful by helping you help the other Villagers.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Because that's what la familia Madrigal is all about. Helping the community!

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
I'll be your eyes and ears around here and let you know if anyone needs help.

See you soon, {PlayerName}. And thanks again for your help with Mini-Casita.
