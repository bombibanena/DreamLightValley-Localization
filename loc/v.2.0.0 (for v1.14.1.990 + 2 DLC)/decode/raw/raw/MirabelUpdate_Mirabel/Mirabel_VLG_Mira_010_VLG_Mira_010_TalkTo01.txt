See, the floor and the walls are pretty messed up.

It still looks cute.

What did it look like before?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess shabby chic is very in right now...

Way to look on the bright side, {PlayerName}! But I promise, it was even better before.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
The floor was painted, and the walls were bright and colorful.

Now, they're just kind of blah. I want to fix them, then repaint them in greens and yellows. Where do you think we should start?

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Let's start with the basics... We'll need some materials, such as <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Stone</ActivityItem>, to replace the damaged ones.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
As for the pigments, I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Dandelions</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Yellow Daisies</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Green Rising Penstemons</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
I can get all of that for you.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
That'd be amazing! Thank you! I'll start thinking about the new patterns I'm gonna paint and getting things ready in here.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Well... I suppose that's one way of looking at it. But it was really great before.
