There are so many stars here. And everyone shines.

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
I mean literally shines. With all the little sparkly, glowing bits. What's the deal with that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think it's Dreamlight?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You could ask Merlin.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Oh! That makes sense.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
I have noticed that magic can be pretty sparkly.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Neat! ... I don't know what that is.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Merlin told me about it. It's a kind of magic, and everything here is made of it.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Everything? That's amazing! And pretty. Super pretty!

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
You're right! I'm sure he'll know.

He's like a wise abuelo for the entire Valley.
