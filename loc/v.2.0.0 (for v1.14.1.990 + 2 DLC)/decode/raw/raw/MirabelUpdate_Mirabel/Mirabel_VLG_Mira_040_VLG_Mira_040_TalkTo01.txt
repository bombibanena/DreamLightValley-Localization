That's it! The tablecloth... for the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>. I remember now!

Moana, Anna, Elsa and I... We were such good friends. We spent so much time together. It was amazing!

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Moana reminded me of my sister Luisa. She's always so strong and protective.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
What about Anna and Elsa?

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Well, I have a lot in common with Anna. We both have sisters who have magical gifts, and we don't. Plus, we both like making sure everyone is happy.

And Elsa... At first I thought she was a bit of a seÃ±orita perfecta like Isabela used to be. But she's so nice once you get to know her.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
We would gather around my <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem> for parties or go on adventures. We had such a good time.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
I wish it were still like that. The Forgetting... it took away so much.

Let's start by recreating the moment in the Memory...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It'd be so cute.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Where do you propose we start?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll bet there's some spark left of all that friendship.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Oh, I'd love that!

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
But we'd need the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem> to do that... And I haven't seen it anywhere since I got back to the Village.

The Memory took place on the Beach. Maybe I could find some clue about what happened there.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
Well, I suppose we could start by searching for the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>... But I haven't seen it anywhere since I got back.

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
Oh, I'm sure there is!

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
Hmm... But how would we recreate the Memory...
