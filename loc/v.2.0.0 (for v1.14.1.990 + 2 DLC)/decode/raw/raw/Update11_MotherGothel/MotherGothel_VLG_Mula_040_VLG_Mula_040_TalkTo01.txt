Ah, {PlayerName}, what can I do for you?

TAG: Player_000_f
I've joined Mulan's team for your capture the flag competition.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Teamwork rules!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We're all going to have fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But I'll be rooting for you.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Oh, aren't you adorable?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
But Mulan is a capable strategist, I'll give her that. Recruiting YOU, my only REAL competition here... Well.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
I didn't see that coming.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
No matter... I'll defeat her all the same. Other people only slow you down.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
May the best team win.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's not true.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What made you so cynical?

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Oh, I will.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Now then, I know that fool, the Fairy Godmother, is acting as arbiter for the contest.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
She's waiting for me to bring her <ActivityItem>Mini Flags</ActivityItem> for the competition. Since you're the last-minute entry, don't you think you ought to <Lore>make the flags and bring them to her</Lore>?

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Should be simple enough. Even for you...

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Just kidding, dear. Ta-ta!

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
We'll see, won't we?

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
You say "cynical," I say "realistic." What matters is, I will be victorious.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Fun... As if I was a child needing to be entertained... No, I intend to win.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Of course you will, dear. You know who's the most talented in the Valley.
