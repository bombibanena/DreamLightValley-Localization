Hey, um... {PlayerName}? Do you have some time? I need to ask you somethin'... and it's a little embarrassing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is everything okay, Pumbaa?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's talk later, okay?

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Kinda? See, Timon and I went to Remy's restaurant today for our favorite meal.

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
We've been goin' every day since we got here! Restaurants are NEAT!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I love dining out!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I like cooking for myself!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
No restaurants in the jungle, huh?

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
It's the best! I love to rustle up my own grubs but... Gee, Remy sure makes yummy food!

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
So what's the problem, Pumbaa? You said it was sort of embarrassing?

TAG: Pumbaa_013_f
Well... the moment we walked into Remy's... everyone else left. It felt JUST like the old days by the watering hole...

TAG: Pumbaa_014_f
I thought me and Timon had figured out how to make me smell not-so-bad but... uh... We think something's different now.

TAG: Pumbaa_021_f
Or everybody's mad at me?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'm sure there's an explanation.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Maybe the Villagers had somewhere to be?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Nothing wrong with being stinky!

TAG: Pumbaa_017_f
If there is, I sure could use some help figurin' it out.

TAG: Pumbaa_019_f
Could ya <Lore>ask Elsa and Daisy</Lore> why they left Chez Remy?

TAG: Pumbaa_020_f
I can't do it myself. I'm too embarrassed.

TAG: Pumbaa_016_f
I know you're tryin' to make me feel better, {PlayerName}, but I KNOW they left 'cause of me.

TAG: Pumbaa_018_f
Gee, thanks! But I don't wanna be SO stinky I clear the place. I thought I'd left all that behind me.

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
You do? I think eating would be tough if I had to do more than find some bugs or visit Chez Remy every day.

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
Nope! Though now, Timon's thinkin' we should start one for the other animals. He likes thinkin' big ideas.

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Oh, okay. But if you could hurry, I'd sure appreciate it.
