I heard about what happened in Scar's Cave, {PlayerName}. Thanks for helpin' out. Timon's been real nervous ever since he saw Scar was here.

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
It's no problem. I'm just glad he's starting to relax.

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Do ya think he is? He still seems a little worried to me.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Sort of.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think his worries are starting to melt away.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He probably needs a little more time.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe "relax" is a bit of a strong word.

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Well, Timon's my best buddy. I wanna help him any way I can.

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
I was thinking we can plan something fun for him!

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Oooh, yeah! What are ya thinkin' about?

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
I would like to help him learn about hakuna matata â the human way!

TAG: Pumbaa_020_f
When I need to relax, I like to...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...chill out with something tasty to eat!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...distract myself with an activity to de-stress.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...hang out with my friends.

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
Sounds like my kind of hakuna matata!

TAG: Pumbaa_023_f
Oh, I know what to do! I'll tell him what Merlin told me about the sun. Timon thinks it's the world's biggest glowworm.

TAG: Pumbaa_013_f
I can start by making some refreshing ice cream!

TAG: Pumbaa_014_f
Oh-oh! I was talkin' to Remy about "iced cream"! He gave me this recipe that sounds delicious!

TAG: Pumbaa_016_f
That's perfect! And after the ice cream, we can get together and play a board game!

TAG: Pumbaa_017_f
Why would we play a game that makes us bored?

TAG: Pumbaa_019_f
A board game is a game that's played ON a board. Though I suppose you can play it WHEN you're bored, too.

TAG: Pumbaa_021_f
Regardless, they're tons of fun!

TAG: Pumbaa_022_f
Well, I can't wait to try!

TAG: Pumbaa_018_f
Perfect! I'll go <Lore>gather Ingredients for the ice cream</Lore> and <Lore>find materials to make a board game</Lore>. You keep Timon occupied while I'm gone!

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Oh, I think Timon definitely needs a distraction right now.

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Me too! Friends are the best!

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
Well, Timon's my best buddy. I'm sure he'll like it here soon.
