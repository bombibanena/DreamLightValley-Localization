{PlayerName}, am I glad to see you. I want to hobby! Do ya think you could help me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What do you mean you "want to hobby"?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm a little busy... Maybe later?

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Well, since ya helped me with bathing and brushing my teeth, I've been feelin' GREAT!

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Now, I want to go hobby-ing. Mickey said a hobby is somethin' you do for fun.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
And I LOVE fun!

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
Right... Okay. So a hobby could actually be anything... Is there something you're interested in specifically?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Fishing?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Flower picking?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Mining?

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Gee... I'm not sure what I'd use fish for.

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
Do ya think I could do somethin' artistic like my pal Rafiki does with his paints?

TAG: Pumbaa_013_f
Sure! We just need to find the right art...

TAG: Pumbaa_014_f
Say, have you ever thought about pottery? Making stuff out of clay?

TAG: Pumbaa_015_f
I don't know what that is, but it sounds fun. Do ya think Timon could join in?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sure! Let's make it a pottery class!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Are you two ever apart?

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
Pottery might be hard with hooves...

TAG: Pumbaa_017_f
Oh boy! I can't wait to try somethin' new!

TAG: Pumbaa_019_f
All right, Pumbaa. You go talk to Timon. I'll see about getting a pottery class set up.

TAG: Pumbaa_020_f
Rapunzel knows lots about pottery. I'll <Lore>talk to her</Lore> to see what we need.

TAG: Pumbaa_021_f
Minnie is our resident art expert â she's so creative! I'll <Lore>talk to her</Lore> to see what we need.

TAG: Pumbaa_016_f
Not if we can help it!

TAG: Pumbaa_018_f
Maybe. But I'll try anything once!

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Well, I do love SMELLING flowers, but I don't wanna pick 'em.

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Ya mean, diggin' up fancy rocks like you do? I think that might hurt my hooves.

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
That's okay! I'll see ya soon!
