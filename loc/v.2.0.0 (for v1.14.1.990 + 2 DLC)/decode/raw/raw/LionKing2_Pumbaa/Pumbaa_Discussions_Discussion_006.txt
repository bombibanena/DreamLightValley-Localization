Well, at first I was scared of her since she tried to eat me. But now we're great friends!

I try to help her eat more bugs. For protein and 'cause they're yummy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Have you explained that they're slimy, yet satisfying?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe she hasn't found the right bug?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe bugs aren't for her.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
I have! But for some reason, she wasn't convinced.

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Maybe not! I'll see if I can find her some new kinds.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
Hmm... Maybe she'll like beetles?

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Really? I guess just 'cause Simba likes bugs doesn't mean Nala will too, huh?
