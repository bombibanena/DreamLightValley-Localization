Are you okay, Pumbaa? You haven't done anything with your clay yet.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Oh, I'm great! I've been thinkin' this whole time about what I wanna do, and now I know!

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
See! It's in honor of my favorite food in the world: the humble grub!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This is a masterpiece.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The grubs look so realistic!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you SURE you've never made pottery before?

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
Oh? REALLY? Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
And ya know what? I really like EVERYONE'S clay creations. I wish I could show 'em to the whole Valley!

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Hey... maybe we can. What if we put on an art show?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Everyone can see your work!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'll get to decorate very fancily!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's about time we had ART in this place!

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
Really? We can do that?! But, uh... how do I make an art show?

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
Let's get started right away! I'll <Lore>go to Mr. McDuck's</Lore> to see if he has any furniture we can use as displays!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Does this mean you'll help me set it up? Thanks, pal!

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
Aw, there's lots of art here. But I'm real flattered you wanna show off ours. It means a whole lot.

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Aw, you really think so? Thanks!

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
I'm sure. But after years of huntin' for bugs, I've gotten pretty dexterous with my snout.
