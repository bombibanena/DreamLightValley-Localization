Oh no. What are ya worried about, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
Tell your buddy Pumbaa all your troubles.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Night Thorns. Those spiky purple things.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
My friends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Just all kinds of stuff.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Oh... Well, I'm gonna tell ya a secret. Ready?

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Sometimes, I worry about stuff too. 'Specially my friends!

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Like when Simba was just a little lion, and we found him in the desert?

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
I was so worried about him!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh, Pumbaa. That's so sad.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You worry about things, too?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
But you're always saying "hakuna matata"!

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
Oh, it's okay, now. Everything worked out great!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Just goes to show ya, all worries go away after a while. Sometimes ya just gotta help 'em along.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Sure! And Timon does too, sometimes. But then we talk to each other.

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
It helps make the big worries feel not so big.

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Yeah. But it doesn't ALWAYS work...

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
Sometimes I gotta talk to Timon or Simba. Or go for a swim. Then I feel better.
