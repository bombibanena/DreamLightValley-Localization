Timon loves crunchy bugs the most.

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
But I love the slimy ones best!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Slimy sounds interesting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Crunchy would be best.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Both sound good.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
They're great! Slurpin' down a log full of slimy grubs sure is satisfying.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yeah!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Yuck!

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
I'll save you some caterpillars!

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Oh, you should try it! Once you taste squirmy, slimy grubs, they're all you'll want!

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
You think so?

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
Maybe I should try more crunchy bugs, then.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
It's always good to try different things!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You should do whatever feels right.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Well, I haven't met a bug I didn't like yet!

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Hmm...

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
I guess I can eat the slimy bugs and leave the crunchy ones for Timon!

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
Ya think so? I guess I do like crunchy bugs ALMOST as much as I like slimy ones...

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
I think you're right. Both are better! Thanks, kid!
