Pumbaa! There's a bunch of strange bugs showing up in the Valley.

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
They seem to have something to do with the Forgetting and the Night Thorns...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
We need your help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
They might be dangerous.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
SAVE US! BUGS ARE ICKY!

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
You do? Just tell me how I can be helpful!

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
I already spoke to Timon, and he's on board too!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Hey, that's great!

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
Let's <Lore>meet up in Merlin's library</Lore> to discuss our plans.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
We better get Timon to help too!

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Don't worry; I'll talk to him next.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Well, those bugs better watch out, 'cause I'm one dangerous warthog!

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Oh, don't worry, {PlayerName}. Me and Timon can get this under control in no time!
