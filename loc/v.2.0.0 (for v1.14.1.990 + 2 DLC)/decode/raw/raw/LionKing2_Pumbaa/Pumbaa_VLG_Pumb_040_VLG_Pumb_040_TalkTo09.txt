So... Jack was tryin' to keep the Night Mites? I didn't know he liked to eat bugs.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think maybe he wanted a pet... Or something.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's VERY curious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't think he eats...

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Aw, that's sweet, even if the mites could be trouble.

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
Still...

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
Did we do the right thing? Takin' the bugs away from him?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
The Night Mites are dangerous.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Jack will have a new fascination in a minute.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
It was tough â but necessary.

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
You're right... Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
Say, could you go <Lore>check with Timon</Lore>? I wanna stay and talk to Jack, so I can keep him company. We can talk about our favorite bugs!

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Really? Okay... That makes me feel better.

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
I guess you're right.

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
Who could blame him? They smell DELICIOUS, even if they are dangerous.

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
I don't think he was gonna eat them, Pumbaa â I think he wanted to keep them? Study them, maybe?

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Huh... Oh well, more bugs for us!
