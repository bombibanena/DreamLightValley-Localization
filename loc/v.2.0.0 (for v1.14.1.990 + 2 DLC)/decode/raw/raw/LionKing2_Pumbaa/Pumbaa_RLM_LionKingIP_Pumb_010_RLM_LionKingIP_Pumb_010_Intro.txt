Good morning, {PlayerName}! Welcome to your second day of hakuna matata lessons. How'd ya sleep?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm refreshed and ready to go!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Okay, but I was afraid something was going to eat us.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Badly. Leaves are UNCOMFORTABLE.

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
That's great! And it's a good warm-up for today's lesson...

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
I'm gonna teach ya the art of relaxing!

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
'Cause resting and relaxing are real different things. One's for the body, and the other's for the mind!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's so wise!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Huh... That kinda makes sense.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I think you just made that up.

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
Thanks!

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
To relax, first ya have to find a PLACE to relax.

TAG: Pumbaa_013_f
Sometimes, Timon and I like to make our beds using <ActivityItem>Palm Tree Sap</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Jungle Vines</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Pumbaa_014_f
We attach the vines to two trees with the sap and then you can lounge in 'em. It's REAL relaxing!

TAG: Pumbaa_015_f
It sounds like you're talking about a hammock. I'll <Lore>start to look for supplies in the jungle</Lore> to make a hammock of my own.

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Thanks! And after today's lesson I think you'll understand it all.

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
You bet I did! Not JUST now, but I did think of it before.

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Aw, you don't have to worry about that here. Simba made sure it's a real safe place.

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
Since ya didn't sleep so good, I think you're gonna like today's lesson.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
Gee, I'm sorry. I hope today's lesson will help.
