That sure was nice. I don't know about you, but I'm feeling refreshed and relaxed!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm a relaxation genius now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Who knew relaxing could be so fun?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is it possible you're OVER-rested?

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Oh boy, I was hoping you'd say that! That means we can move onto the next part of our day.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
'Cause the other side of rest is PLAY!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Play what?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds good to me!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Let me guess... ANOTHER nap?

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Well, I was gonna suggest we run through some mud piles, but they're all <Lore>dried up</Lore>...

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Don't worry, Pumbaa. I think I can turn those piles into mud again.

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
Leave it to me and my <Lore>Watering Can</Lore>.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Gee, I'm real glad you're havin' fun.

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
And now you can get ready for more fun!

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Nope! 'Cause I listen to my body.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
And right now, it's sayin' it's time to play!
