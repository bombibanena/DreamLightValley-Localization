Yoo-hoo! WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_001_f
What's that, WALLÂ·E? Oh, it's a toaster.

TAG: WallE_002_f
Huh? ... Ooh! Ooh!

TAG: WallE_003_f
Yeah, those are the dials. You turn them to set how toasted you want your toast.

TAG: WallE_004_f
Wait. You probably don't know what toast is. Toast is bread that you cook and then eat.

TAG: WallE_005_f
Uhh...

TAG: Player_000_f
Bread is human food. It gives us energy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Like you get energy from the sun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's great with jam or peanut butter.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's an essential part of any good sandwich.

TAG: WallE_006_f
Ooh!

TAG: WallE_007_f
Ta-da!

TAG: WallE_008_f
Whoa!

TAG: WallE_010_f
Whoa!
