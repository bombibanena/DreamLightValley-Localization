Wow!

TAG: WallE_001_f
They look beautiful.

TAG: WallE_002_f
I'm glad I could help you here, but now I need your help, WALLÂ·E.

TAG: WallE_004_f
Ooooh?

TAG: Player_000_f
Will you come to my Village?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's in trouble.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Merlin told me to get you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I helped you, so you owe me.

TAG: WallE_005_f
Aww...

TAG: WallE_006_f
We need all the help we can get!

TAG: WallE_003_f
Oh. Hmm...

TAG: WallE_010_f
It feels like you're not certain you should come.

TAG: WallE_016_f
Maybe Merlin knows what would make you feel more comfortable.

TAG: WallE_017_f
I'll go ask him.

TAG: WallE_008_f
Huh?

TAG: WallE_009_f
Oh, right! You don't remember who Merlin is.

TAG: WallE_007_f
But he might know how to make you feel more comfortable.

TAG: WallE_011_f
Uh...

TAG: WallE_012_f
Err. Pressuring you like this probably isn't the way to go.
