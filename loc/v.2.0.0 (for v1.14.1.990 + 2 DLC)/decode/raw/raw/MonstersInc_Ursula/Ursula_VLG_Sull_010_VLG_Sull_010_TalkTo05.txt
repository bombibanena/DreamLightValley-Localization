Ah, angelfish, what can I do for you today?

TAG: Ursula_006_f
You don't have a <ActivityItem>Videotape</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Oh, I do. But it's not anything that hirsute do-gooder and his one-eyed friend will want.

TAG: Player_000_f
Seems like a sensitive topic...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So, I'll leave it alone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
But how can you be sure?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Now I need to know everything.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Sulley is trying to revive Monster Movie Night andâ

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Stop right there! If he wants to make a deal for me to create something for the event, he'll have to ask me himself.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
No heâ you know what, Ursula? I'm surprised you even know what it is.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
Oh, I learned all about this "movie" nonsense during my previous time here in the Valley. Some Villagers are very fond of such a silly pastime.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
I didn't think much of it until I realized it could provide marvelous insights into the desires and needs of you surface dwellers.

So I bargained with Scrooge for the proper equipment and studied his videotapes.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Maybe you can help. We're looking for a <ActivityItem>Videotape</ActivityItem> of a movie that would be perfect for the relaunch. Scrooge thinks you might have it. "20,000 Giant Arachnids Under the Bed"?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Sorry, but I don't have what you're looking for.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Smart thinking, dearie. However, since you're respecting my privacy, I'll tell you what this movie's about. Because I know you'd NEVER tell another soul.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
It's... Well, it's a love story between two humans. No monsters in it. It's called "The Prince's Secret Pirate Romance."

TAG: Ursula_014_f
You like... watching rom-coms?

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Bite your tongue! I don't LIKE them. I STUDY them to know what humans want...

TAG: Ursula_016_f
All right... I don't think you have what I'm looking for. I'll leave you to your "studies."

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Because it's a love story between two humans. No monsters in it. It's called "The Prince's Secret Pirate Romance."

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Beware, {PlayerName}. Curiosity killed the catfish.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Oh, come on!

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Fine! It's a love story between two humans. No monsters in it... It's called "The Prince's Secret Pirate Romance."
