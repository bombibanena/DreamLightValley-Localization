Gawrsh, {PlayerName}, looks like you're in a hurry!

TAG: Goofy_001_f
I am! Pumbaa is stuck in a log in The Lion King Realm and I need to help unstick him.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Do you have any advice?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do you have any tools?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
HELP, GOOFY! HELP!

TAG: Goofy_004_f
What did ya already try to do to get him free?

TAG: Goofy_008_f
We tried using some oil... but he's still stuck in the log.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Sounds like you could use a little leverage to get him outta there.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
I've got a spare plunger in my tools you can have. It's a little old though.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
To make sure it's up to the job, you'll have to reinforce it. I'll give ya a list of what ya need.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're the best, Goofy!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Thanks a bunch!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Pumbaa will be free in no time!

TAG: Goofy_012_f
Just happy to help!

TAG: Goofy_011_f
You betcha!

TAG: Goofy_013_f
I hope he and Timon'll be back soon! We miss those two around here.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Sure do!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
I will, {PlayerName}!
