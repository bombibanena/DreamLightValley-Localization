Drat! When did this appear?!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
The <Lore>secret entrance to the palace</Lore> is an old cellar door tucked away right here in the Lagoon...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
...but now this... this <Lore>rift in time</Lore> has blocked the way!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe there's another way in?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How do we get rid of this thing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
ARRRGGGHHH! Not again.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I'm afraid there isn't. I've already investigated teleportation, making you permeable so you could walk through the walls, disguising you as a statue and offering you to Jafar as a gift...

TAG: Merlin_012_f
...using your imagination.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No problem! I'm great at that!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think I can manage that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Uh-oh. I'm not very imaginative...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
...but Jafar has mounted defenses against all of my plans.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
It will be tricky, but we must <Lore>heal this rift in time</Lore> to proceed.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Got it. So how do we do that?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I deduce that all the rifts across the Isle are connected to one another. And to the Spark's magic.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Therefore, if we <Lore>close some of the other rifts</Lore>, we might be able to weaken this one enough to seal it.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
How do we close the rifts? Can I use my Hourglass?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Unfortunately not. For this, we need a different sort of magic. Something that will allow us to tap into the power of the Spark itself and turn it back on Jafar.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
I've done some research, and it seems that the key to the Spark's power is...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Yes, but I fear even for one as imaginative as you, some help might be needed.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
I suggest you <Lore>seek help from Oswald</Lore>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Why Oswald?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Got it. I'll go get help from Oswald.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Well, I've spent some time studying the fellow. He is quite fascinating.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Got it. I'll go get help from Oswald.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Yes, and hurry, {PlayerName}! <Lore>Seek help from Oswald</Lore> so you can close the rifts and get us into the palace!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
You see, before any of us were here in Dreamlight Valley, this place belonged to others.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
In the same way that the Valley now shapes itself around <i>your</i> hopes, <i>your</i> dreams, and <i>your</i> memories...

TAG: Merlin_018_f
...once upon a time, it belonged to someone else, and Oswald was very special to them.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
I'm sure there are stories you cherish that were passed down from a trusted loved one. Well, Oswald is a bit like those stories... passed down.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
So how does that help us now?

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Well, Oswald surely must have wisdom from seeing the ways that Dreamlight Valley and the Isle have changed.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
And if not, then perhaps he can give you a lesson in utilizing your ingenuity.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Regardless... Things, er, well, heh, they do just seem to have a way of working out when Oswald is around, don't they?

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Nonsense! You're much more imaginative than you think, {PlayerName}. I've seen it myself.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
But nonetheless, I fear you'll need some help with this.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
We mustn't get discouraged. Jafar is counting on us simply giving up.
