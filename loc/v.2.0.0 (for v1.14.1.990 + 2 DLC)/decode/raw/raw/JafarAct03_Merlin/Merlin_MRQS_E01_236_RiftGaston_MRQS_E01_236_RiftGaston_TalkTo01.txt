Oswald, I need your help. There's a Villager who's having trouble tapping into his imagination.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
No problemo! Tell me who it is and I'll have 'em imaginin' floatin' ponies eating ice cream in no time!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's Gaston!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Somebody with a very thick neck...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Somebody who eats a lot of eggs...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
No way. Nuh-uh. I ain't helpin' that palooka. He's hopeless!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I was talkin' to him just the other day and he started yammerin' on about huntin' me and turnin' me into a stew!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He DID NOT.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Oh Gaston...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
No offense, but you don't look very appetizing.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
You bet your magic fishin' pole he did!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Lemme give ya a piece of advice... That Gaston's got an ego even bigger than his biceps!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
You wanna inspire him to be creative? Take him some place and show him somethin' to remind him of his own heroism. That oughta do it.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Not a bad idea... thanks Oswald! I'll go back and talk to Gaston. Oh, and don't worry about that hunting thing. I'll make sure that never happens.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Right?! Look at me! My arms and legs are all rubbery!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Wait a sec... are you talkin' about Gaston?
