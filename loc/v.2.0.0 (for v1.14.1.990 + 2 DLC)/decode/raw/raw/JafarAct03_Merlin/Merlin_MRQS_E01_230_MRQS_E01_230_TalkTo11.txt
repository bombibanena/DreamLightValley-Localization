Oswald, I've got a funny question for you.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Don't you worry, chum. I'm used to funny business. Spring it on me and I'll tell ya what's what.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
You've probably noticed things around the Isle are turning black and white...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
...including my friend Mickey.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Merlin told me we need to "use our imaginations" to close the Time Rifts...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Oh-hoo-hoo! Have you come to the right rabbit!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
See, I been doin' some experiments of my own. Ya know, tossin' a few things into those time rift-y thingummys to see what happens...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oswald, that sounds dangerous!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you discover anything?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
You bet it was! And fun, too!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Mostly nothin' happened when I threw stuff in the rifts...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
...but THEN I drew somethin' funny on a napkin and tossed that in. After that, all I had to do was think about the rift closin' and BAM! It zipped right up!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
That's it! So all we have to do is make something using our imaginations and toss it into the rifts?

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Sure seems like it. Except... When I tried it again, I got bupkus!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
I think each rift's gotta be closed by <Lore>a different joe's imagination</Lore>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Got any tips for using my imagination?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Got it. I'll go ask some people.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Absopositively!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Maximizin' your imagination is all about usin' what you got but in funny kindsa ways!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Ya know, like lookin' at stuff and askin' what else it could be instead. Is a hat only a hat? OR is it also a giant soup bowl that leaks real slooooowly?!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Say, maybe you could try <Lore>askin' Rapunzel, Gaston, EVE, and that Mickey fella you mentioned</Lore>?

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Sounds like Mickey's in heaps of trouble, so I bet he'd love to help.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
That Rapunzel sure has a great imagination.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Gaston... well, since he imagines he's such a swell guy, he could prob'ly imagine just about anything.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
And as for that clankin' contraption, EVE? Gee, I'd sure like to find out what she could imagine if she put her gears to it!
