{PlayerName}! We must stop Jafar's meddling with the Spark of Imagination.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
The color is slowly draining out of everything. And those mysterious rifts throughout the Isle are a very ill omen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Really? I hadn't noticed.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So how do we stop him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Defeat Jafar. Fix the Isle. Adding it to my very long to-do list...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Not noticed?! Why, why, how could you miss all of theâ

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Oh. *sigh* I suppose that was a joke.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Well, this is no laughing matter! Though, I suppose it doesn't hurt to keep our sense of humor amidst all this calamity.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
We should start by investigating the strangest phenomena happening on the Isle.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
That is... have you noticed <Lore>anything odd happening with Mickey</Lore>?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Something's happening with Mickey?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Oh no. If Mickey's in trouble... now this is personal.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He seems to be flickering in black and white!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I'm afraid so. He appears to be <Lore>flickering in black and white</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
It's almost as if Mickey is <Lore>caught between the present and the past</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
We must <Lore>speak to Mickey</Lore> and investigate this phenomena immediately!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Indeed!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Precisely!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
That is indeed the question, isn't it...?

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Putting it on the to-do list right between "checking Mr. McDuck's shop for new clothes" and "watering my crops."

TAG: Merlin_014_f
I'd suggest you move it straight to the top of that list!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Or else there might not be any shop to visit or crops to water... or anything else for that matter.
