Excellent find, {PlayerName}! Now, let's have a look at these...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Hmm...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Um...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's wrong?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, I barely understand any of it as well.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not sure I've seen you stumped before.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
This is unlike any sort of magic, enchantment, or power I've studied!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are we really at last options already?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I was afraid you'd say that.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Not sure I'd even consider it magic, to be honest.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Well, that explains it then! We find ourselves in the realm of "something else."

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Okay, so what's the plan?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
{PlayerName}, I wish I had the answer... but this flattening phenomenon of Oswald's has me mystified. It appears to be immune to charms, incantations, potions, and saying "please."

TAG: Merlin_009_f
But what about Oswald's strange distortions? They might be getting worse...

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Well, as to that, I have an idea, but you may not like it. In fact, I don't quite like it either.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Let's hear it, Merlin.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
We ought to... *sigh* speak to Jafar.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
We just got him locked away in the lamp!

TAG: Merlin_024_f
All right, he better be cool about this...

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Yes, well, we could always try my first last resort â we ask Oswald to remove a dimension from everything else, and we all live on Two-Dimensional Isle.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
But for that to work, we must hope that Oswald can remove the SAME dimension from each part of the landscape...

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Uhh, no, let's try Jafar first.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
I know it's not ideal. Yet, despite his... disagreeable nature, we cannot deny Jafar's intelligence.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
His experience living inside the lamp must have given him a certain familiarity with magical space and how it works.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Hopefully, he will have a theory on how to deal with these... flattened objects.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
All right, maybe he'll play nice for a chance to stay out of the lamp. What do I need to do to get him out?

TAG: Merlin_023_f
If you take the lamp to the <Lore>Statue of Time in the heart of the Cave of Wonders and use your Royal Hourglass on it</Lore>, that should release him.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Being bewildered is the first step to learning! But... it's true. I am at a bit of a loss.
