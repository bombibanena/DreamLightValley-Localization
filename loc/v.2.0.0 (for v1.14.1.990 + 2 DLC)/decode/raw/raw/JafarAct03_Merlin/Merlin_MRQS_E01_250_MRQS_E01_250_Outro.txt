{PlayerName}! You've done it! You have the Spark of Imagination!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Now, what happened to Jafar?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
I tricked him into trapping himself inside this lamp.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Guess he's not as smart as he thought he was.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
His ego was his undoing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He was almost too clever for it. Almost.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Ha-ha! That's splendid! How ingenious of you!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Now, we must decide what's to be done with the Spark...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's too powerful. We should lock it away.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I want to use it to help the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe we could destroy it, once and for all.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
I want to use it to fulfill my every whim and wish!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Well, the ancient civilization that once ruled Eternity Isle must have thought the same. They locked it away in those ruins...

TAG: Merlin_006_f
...but that didn't stop Jafar from getting his hands on it.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
You know, there is something else we could do...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
What's that?

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Share the Spark. With everyone.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Its power is too much for one person when it's an object you can hold in your hands. But if you scattered it throughout the entire Valley...

TAG: Merlin_011_f
...it could bring a bit of magic into everyone's day, and pose no danger for anyone.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Everyone wins! I love it!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
This feels right...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
*sigh* So you're telling me I have to share it?

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Precisely!

TAG: Merlin_013_f
The things we create together... the ideas we share...

TAG: Merlin_014_f
They're the only things more powerful than the passage of time. Friendship, love, and creativity are what truly last for an eternity.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Heh. It's a paradox, isn't it? We only get to keep what we give away.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
All right... so how do we do this?

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Just hold the Spark... and make a wish with your heart to share it with all of Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
There is just one thing I need to do with it first, though.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Don't worry. It's not for me. I need to help a friend.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
I'll gather everyone at once. <Lore>Meet me outside the palace!</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_020_f
I assure you, it is!

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Don't sound so disappointed, {PlayerName}. Haven't you learned anything from all of this?

TAG: Merlin_022_f
A fine aspiration indeed. Though I'm afraid such immense power can corrupt even those with the best of intentions.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
I doubt that we could destroy it even if we wished to. It's far too powerful.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
What?! Didn't you see what happened when Jafar tried to do exactly that? The Spark's magic won't work when used towards selfish ends.
