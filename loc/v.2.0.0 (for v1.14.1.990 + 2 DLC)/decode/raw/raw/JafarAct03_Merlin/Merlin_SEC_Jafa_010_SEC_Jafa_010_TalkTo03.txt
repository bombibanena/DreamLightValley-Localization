Hey Merlin, can we talk about the Jafar situation?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Why of course, {PlayerName}! How did his community service progress?

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Uhh, ups and downs, I suppose.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
I feel like it inspired memories of his ambition and greed just as much as it inspired positive emotions.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Oh, that is a quandary indeed.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
But on the other hand, I spoke with some of the other Villagers, and it seems that Jafar has actually been really nice to them.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Not only is he giving gifts, but he's giving gifts that seem to suggest that he's trying to make a connection with the Villagers.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
How marvelous! Still... I worry that it may be a ruse to ensure his freedom to continue to plot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I agree.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I hope not...

TAG: Merlin_000_f
But we can't assume anything for now. We need to go by his actions, not our suspicions.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Perfect! Thanks, Merlin.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
So, I was thinking â we should show him that we appreciate the effort he's making.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
I quite agree, {PlayerName}. You don't lead someone to goodness through constant reprimand.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Yeah! I'm going to decorate around the palace with Jafar's favorite aesthetics, but I think we need something else with a little wow factor.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Ah... I think I know just the thing!

TAG: Merlin_026_f
There you are, {PlayerName} â that Iago-inspired centerpiece should remind Jafar of his previous companion.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Wow, great idea! Jafar plays his cards close to his chest, but I think that he kinda misses Iago.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Well, I hope a memory of a good friend will continue to inspire him toward goodness.
