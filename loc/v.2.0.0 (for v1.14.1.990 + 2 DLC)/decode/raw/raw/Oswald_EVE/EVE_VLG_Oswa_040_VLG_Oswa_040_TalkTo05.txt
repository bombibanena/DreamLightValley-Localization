Hey, EVE! I was hoping you could help me with a little something.

TAG: EVE_002_f
Oh?

TAG: EVE_003_f
So I imagine that by now you've heard of the escaped flying trolley...

TAG: EVE_004_f
*giggle*

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll take that as a yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hey, that poor trolley needs our help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yeah, this whole thing is a little ridiculous.

TAG: EVE_005_f
I'm trying to build a landing track for the trolley.

TAG: EVE_008_f
As a flying machine, I thought you might have some insights as to how to help the poor trolley land safely.

TAG: EVE_009_f
Uh... Hmm...

TAG: EVE_010_f
Oh! Oh! *digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_011_f
What's this â flares? Perfect!

TAG: EVE_012_f
Directive! *giggle*

TAG: EVE_013_f
Thanks, EVE â talk to you later!

TAG: EVE_006_f
Oh... *digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_007_f
*giggle* *digital beeps*
