*questioning digital beeps*

EVE! I've got a very special directive for you.

TAG: EVE_002_f
Ooooh.

TAG: EVE_003_f
Scan this photo. There are these Ancient Ruins underneath Eternity Isle.

TAG: EVE_004_f
There's some kind of funny ancient computer down there. I need you to hack into it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Pretty please?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Does that seem like something you can do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Should be a piece of cake, right?

TAG: EVE_005_f
Hmmm...

TAG: EVE_013_f
It looks like some kind of map... a map to pieces of something called an "Ancient Processor."

TAG: EVE_014_f
That's got to be what we need! I'll <Lore>use this map to find all those pieces</Lore> and let you know once I've got them!

TAG: EVE_006_f
Ahhh... *beeps*

TAG: EVE_007_f
Oh no, EVE! You look sad. You don't think you'll be able to talk to this computer?

TAG: EVE_008_f
No.

TAG: EVE_009_f
Hmmm. There are so many pieces of old technology around this Isle.

TAG: EVE_010_f
There must be SOME kind of way to make an accessory to help you link up with that computer.

TAG: EVE_011_f
*gasp!*

TAG: EVE_012_f
Whoa, what's this?
