Someone's here?

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Wait... SOMEONE'S HERE! WOOHOO!

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Sorry. I've just been lost in these woods for so long.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What were you doing in the woods?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you here alone?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Do you need help?

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Well, Donald Duck and I were searching the Valley for something to help fight the Night Thorns and stop the Forgetting.

TAG: Kristoff_000_f
But I sort of... lost him. Or maybe he lost me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How do you lose Donald Duck?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is he in danger?

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
It's actually easier than you'd think.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
We were in the <Lore>Forest of Valor</Lore> when the Night Thorns blocked us in...

TAG: Kristoff_019_f
...and that's when we saw a <Lore>Dark Entity</Lore> removing the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem> from the Forest Pillar...

TAG: Kristoff_031_f
Dark Entity? It must have been the Forgotten! Ursula warned me about this.

TAG: Kristoff_032_f
Never heard of 'em... but whoever it was, they didn't seem friendly.

TAG: Kristoff_017_f
Out of the blue, they just opened a... a doorway and stepped through it! That <Lore>Dark Portal</Lore> over there.

TAG: Kristoff_014_f
Then Donald ran right through the portal, chasing after the Dark Entity.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
That was brave!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
That was foolish!

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Classic Donald Duck. Always in trouble.

TAG: Kristoff_020_f
Brave? Maybe. Foolish? Definitely!

TAG: Kristoff_018_f
I tried to follow him, but he yelled at me to stay put and guard his back. I wanted to argue with him, but you really can't win a fight with Donald Duck.

TAG: Kristoff_015_f
And that's the last time I saw him.

TAG: Kristoff_016_f
It's been so long; I hope he's all right.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
Hey... if you were able to remove the Thorns and find me â maybe you're powerful enough to go through the portal and save him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Never fear. I'm on it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
Gulp. Here goes nothing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
Too scared to do it yourself?

TAG: Kristoff_026_f
Whoa, I wish you'd come to the Valley a long time ago.

TAG: Kristoff_027_f
There's something... special about you... I don't know why, but I know you can do this.

TAG: Kristoff_030_f
Just step through the portal. And don't worry. I'll be waiting for you when you get back.

TAG: Kristoff_028_f
Aw, don't worry.

TAG: Kristoff_023_f
Hey! Not scared. Just... Well, I guess I forgot what had happened. I didn't remember until I saw you.

TAG: Kristoff_029_f
But that's not the reason I think you should be the one to go through that portal.

TAG: Kristoff_021_f
Maybe, but we had to do something!

TAG: Kristoff_022_f
I just hope this time he hasn't gotten himself into trouble he can't get out of.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Thanks for saying that. I've been kicking myself ever since we got split up.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
I really hope not... But maybe.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
No. I mean... yeah... or maybe... I was with someone, but I can't find him now.

TAG: Kristoff_013_f
You see, Donald Duck and I were searching the Valley for something to help fight the Night Thorns and stop the Forgetting.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
You could say that.
