{PlayerName}, some people think it's weird that I spend so much time in the woods. Do you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Not at all.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, a bit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's okay to be weird.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Good to know.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
The forest is just what I'm used to. It's simple there.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Just me and Sven. The trees. The birds. A guy can really think, ya know?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That sounds nice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's where you grew up, right?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Just don't stay alone for too long.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
It is. It's always worked for me.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Yeah. The forest and Troll Valley. Guess that's why I feel at home there.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
I promise I won't. Don't want to lose touch with everyone I care about. And besides, there aren't a lot of carrots in the forest for Sven.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Oh. Hmm...

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Thanks... I guess everyone's weird in their own way, right?
