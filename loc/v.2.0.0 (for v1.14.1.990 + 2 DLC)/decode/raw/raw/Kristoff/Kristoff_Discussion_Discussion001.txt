Is talking about feelings as hard for you as it is for me? Why is that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Because they're important.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Because they're scary.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Because they're weird.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
I guess that makes sense. You don't want to mess up something that important.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
And it's easy to get confused about feelings.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
How do YOU talk about feelings, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Be honest.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Be sensitive.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Just ignore your feelings.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
I'm always honest. It's just sometimes the words I use don't end up saying what I really mean.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
Like one time I called Anna crazy for getting engaged to a man she just met.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
That wasn't the right word at all. I should have said "impetuous," or "eager," or "passionate"! Because Anna is all those things, and I love that about her.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
Yeah, being sensitive isn't really something I learned while climbing mountains and harvesting ice.

TAG: Kristoff_013_f
But ever since I met Anna, I've been trying my best.

TAG: Kristoff_014_f
Does that work? I don't know if that's a good idea.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Wait â why would feelings be scary? They can't bite you, like wolves. You can't fall off the side of a feeling and die.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
They just sit inside of you, always there, haunting your every waking moment and changing everything.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
... Yep. You're right. Feelings can be terrifying.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
You're right, feelings ARE weird. Things were so much simpler when it was just me, Sven and the trolls!

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Simpler... but not as amazing. So I guess feelings are worth it.
