Hey, Kristoff, you play the lute, right?

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Sure. Why do you ask?

TAG: Player_000_f
Stitch is starting a band. He was hoping you might join.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You two would really rock together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It would make Stitch happy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're the only person around here with a lute.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
You think so? I don't know if we'd be a great match as performers.

TAG: Kristoff_016_f
You won't have to do it alone. Prince Eric is going to do it too!

TAG: Kristoff_018_f
Well, that might help. But still...

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Music is something I kind of do for me. I haven't performed much in front of crowds.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's good to get outside your comfort zone.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It would mean the world to Stitch.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You don't have to do it if you don't want to.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
You know, maybe you're right. This might be fun.

TAG: Kristoff_019_f
Stitch, Eric, and I... making music for the whole Village.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
This is either gonna be great or a complete disaster.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
Well... better start practicing!

TAG: Kristoff_020_f
Now that we've got the whole band together, I'm going to go <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>.

TAG: Kristoff_021_f
We'll need sound equipment. He might have some he can lend us.

TAG: Kristoff_022_f
I'll <Lore>keep looking for one more member to join the band</Lore>.

TAG: Kristoff_023_f
Sounds good. Hey, isn't there somebody around here who plays a flute...?

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Stitch and I... making music for the whole Village.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
Well, if it would help the little guy feel more at home in the Village, maybe I should.

TAG: Kristoff_013_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. But... You know what? I'll do it.

TAG: Kristoff_017_f
You won't have to do it alone. I'm still looking for somebody else to join the band.

TAG: Kristoff_014_f
Are you sure there isn't somebody else who'd be better?

TAG: Kristoff_015_f
Well, that's true. But I'm not sure if just having a lute qualifies me for this.
