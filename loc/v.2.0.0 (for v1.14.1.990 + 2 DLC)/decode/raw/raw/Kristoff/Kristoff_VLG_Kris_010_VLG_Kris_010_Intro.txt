Always, for my friends!

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Sorry, some other time.

TAG: Kristoff_000_f
Thanks. Glad you think of me as a friend, 'cause this is a little... odd.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
So, um... While Donald was on the other side of that Dark Portal, I was living in the woods for a pretty long time...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Were you okay out there?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How did you survive by yourself?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why didn't you just come back to the Village?

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Oh yeah, sure. I know how to live in the forest.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
I can find everything I need, food- and shelter-wise.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
But... after all that time out there, I could really use some <ActivityItem>Soap</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Donald said I didn't exactly smell very fresh. Actually, he wasn't that polite.

TAG: Kristoff_013_f
Would you be up for helping me make some <ActivityItem>Soap</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
I'm always happy to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
It's a useful skill to learn.

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
Sure. So you can stop stinking up the whole Valley...

TAG: Kristoff_017_f
Great! Thanks!

TAG: Kristoff_023_f
You know, you kind of remind me of someone... but I can't exactly remember who she was. Strange.

TAG: Kristoff_025_f
Well, to make <ActivityItem>Soap</ActivityItem>, {PlayerName}, we need <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>... Now, I don't wanna scare you, but it's kind of complicated to make.

TAG: Kristoff_026_f
You might want to take notes.

TAG: Kristoff_015_f
For <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>, we need <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
I've never found that in the Village.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
I suppose you know where to get them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
I guess we'll have to burn something?

TAG: Kristoff_019_f
Don't worry. I know what to do.

TAG: Kristoff_032_f
Back when I was stuck in the Forest, I made a campfire near the entrance to the Frosted Heights.

TAG: Kristoff_033_f
If you could get some of the <ActivityItem>Burned Logs</ActivityItem> there, you can grind them into <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> at a Crafting Station.

TAG: Player_001_choice_006_f
Then I bring you the Ashes?

TAG: Player_001_choice_007_f
What do I do next?

TAG: Player_001_choice_008_f
It's still definitely NOT <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_034_f
No, there's one more step, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
After that, you boil the <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> like any other meal to make <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_016_f
Once you've got that, come see me and we can talk about what to do next.

TAG: Player_001_choice_009_f
Okay, got it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_010_f
I'll never remember all this.

TAG: Player_001_choice_011_f
That's one pot I better wash extra carefully...

TAG: Kristoff_038_f
Great!

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
I'll figure out what else we need while you make the <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>. Remember: My camp was near the entrance to the Frosted Heights in the Forest.

TAG: Kristoff_039_f
Don't worry. I can always remind you.

TAG: Kristoff_040_f
Yeah, definitely don't eat <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>. It can be really bad for you.

TAG: Kristoff_035_f
After that, you boil the <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> like any other meal to make <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_037_f
Once you've got that, come see me and we can talk about what to do next.

TAG: Kristoff_036_f
No, you need to boil the <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> like any other meal recipe to get the <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_027_f
Yeah, don't worry.

TAG: Kristoff_031_f
Hold up. Before you start setting stuff on fire...

TAG: Kristoff_021_f
Practical. I like that viewpoint!

TAG: Kristoff_022_f
Hey, I didn't think it was THAT bad.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Easy. I know the plants I can eat, and I made myself a shelter.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
I was pretty comfortable. But when he got back, Donald pointed out that there was one thing I was missing...

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
<ActivityItem>Soap</ActivityItem>. Turns out it's been a while since I've had a bath.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
I wanted to be there in case Donald needed me. When he came back he said... well, he said a lot of things, including that I clearly hadn't found any <ActivityItem>Soap</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
I'm used to living in the woods, but I guess it's not for everyone.

TAG: Kristoff_020_f
Okay, great. I'll be around when you have time.
