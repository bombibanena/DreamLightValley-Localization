{PlayerName}, you've seen those odd-looking, sharp plants, right?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
I think they're called Night Thorns.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Believe me, I've seen them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're kinda hard to miss.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I have to deal with them constantly.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
It seems like they're everywhere.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
The trolls believe that everything in nature has a purpose.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Do you think we could make something useful out of them?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That would be dangerous. They're magic.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Like what?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe if we purified them...

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Oh, wow. It is not smart to mess with magic.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
I'll just leave dealing with the Night Thorns to the magic professionals. Mainly you.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Oh, I don't know... tea? Thorny wreaths? Actually...

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
That sounds like magic. Which I try not to mess with.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Sorry. That doesn't sound like fun.
