Nice <ActivityItem>Carrot Soap</ActivityItem>, {PlayerName}! It smells great!

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
And the <ActivityItem>Coconut</ActivityItem> really adds to it.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Okay, I have to ask: Why <ActivityItem>Carrot</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Do you really like the smell?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is there a specific memory attached to it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You know you don't... EAT the soap... right?

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Yeah, doesn't everyone? What could be better than carrots?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Okay, time for me to try out this new soap. Be back soon!

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
You know, that felt really good. Thanks, {PlayerName}! *sniff sniff* I hope I don't smell like cake.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm glad to have helped.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Thanks for teaching me how to make <ActivityItem>Carrot Soap</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Hurrah! The smell is gone!

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Well, you're really good at helping everyone around here, and I know we all appreciate it.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Anytime!

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
Come on! It wasn't THAT bad!

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Kind of. When I was growing up, carrots were always a big treat for me and my friend Sven. If we had enough to make soap, that was extra special.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Why would Iâ *sigh* No, I don't eat the soap. It's just that reindeer love the smell. Why wouldn't I?
