Hey, {PlayerName}, do you have a minute?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not right now.

TAG: Kristoff_000_f
Thanks! I could use some advice. I went foraging earlier, and I have all these extra materials... Some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Sand</ActivityItem>, and good carving <ActivityItem>Stone</ActivityItem>. What do you think I should do with it all?

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
You could almost start a <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem> with all this...

TAG: Player_000_choice_011_f
Wait! You SHOULD start a <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_012_f
Would that be something you'd be interested in?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
But only if you call it THE KRISTORE.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
I guess I do have experience selling things. Ice. I used to sell ice.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
But harvesting and selling ice seems pretty different from taking care of a <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>. I'd need some guidance.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
I could ask Goofy for advice on how to build your own <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He's always happy to help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You could come with me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Stay here. I'll ask him.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Funny you mention Goofy. The other day, we were fishing next to each other. Everything was calm, relaxing...

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Next thing I know he sneezes, manages to hit me in the head with his fishing rod, and pushes me into the pond.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
Definitely not who I'd go to for fishing advice. But he does run a pretty good Stall.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
I'd be happy to ask him for you... Just to avoid any potential new head injuries.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Thanks.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
I might be...

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. But...

TAG: Kristoff_017_f
Okay. Some other time, then. See ya!
