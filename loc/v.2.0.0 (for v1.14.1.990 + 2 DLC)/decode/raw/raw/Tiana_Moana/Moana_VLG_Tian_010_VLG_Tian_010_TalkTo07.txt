Hey, Moana! Got a little surprise for you.

TAG: Moana_002_f
A surprise? For me?

TAG: Moana_003_f
You are cordially invited to the grand opening of Tiana's Meal Stall!

TAG: Moana_004_f
It's a new food spot where you can get something to go! Maybe eat it at a nice outdoor spot?

TAG: Moana_005_f
That's amazing! I always find that food tastes better when you eat it outside.

And after having a taste of that <ActivityItem>Enchanted Shrimp ÃtouffÃ©e</ActivityItem>, I'm excited to try more of Tiana's recipes!

TAG: Moana_007_f
Great!

TAG: Moana_008_f
There's still some prep to do, but I'll make sure to let you know when we're officially ready for the grand opening.

TAG: Moana_009_f
Yes! I can't wait!
