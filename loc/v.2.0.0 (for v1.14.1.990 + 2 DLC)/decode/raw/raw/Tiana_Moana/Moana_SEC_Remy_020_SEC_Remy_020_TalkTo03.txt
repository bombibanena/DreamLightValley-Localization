Hey Moana, I was wondering â do you recall having a picnic in the Glade of Trust with some of the other Villagers?

TAG: Moana_003_f
I'm trying to figure out the recipe of this mystery meal â and who cooked it â by talking to everyone who was there.

TAG: Moana_009_f
Merlin remembered that it had <ActivityItem>Enchanted Chili Peppers</ActivityItem>, and Mickey remembered that the recipe base was <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Okay, just let me think...

TAG: Moana_005_f
I remember! It was delicious and different from anything I'd ever had on Motunui.

TAG: Moana_006_f
It was the <ActivityItem>Onions</ActivityItem>. They were... different.

TAG: Moana_007_f
Not really sweet, but they had this wonderful full flavor from being cooked down.

I'm not a big fan of onions.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That sounds quite tasty!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Who could have made that meal?

TAG: Moana_001_f
I know a lot of people who aren't. But trust me: When they're cooked like that, they're amazing!

TAG: Moana_015_f
Maybe it was how all the flavors were combined.

TAG: Moana_016_f
I bet you're right!

TAG: Moana_008_f
Well, that's everything. I think I'm ready to make this recipe!

TAG: Moana_014_f
Thanks, Moana. You were a big help!

TAG: Moana_013_f
Great, that's one more Ingredient down!

TAG: Moana_017_f
It was incredible! I hope you can track down the Ingredients. I'd love to try it again.

TAG: Moana_018_f
I wish I could remember...

TAG: Moana_010_f
Merlin remembered that it had <ActivityItem>Enchanted Chili Peppers</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_011_f
Mickey remembered that the recipe had a base of <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_012_f
So far, you're the first person I've spoken to.
