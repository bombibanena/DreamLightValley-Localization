Moana, how are you liking the food?

It's amazing! One of my favorite things about exploring is getting to try new things. And this is sooo good!

I'm really happy that Tiana's back in the Valley.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Yeah, seems like she had her own explorations. She was trapped in a cookbook!

TAG: Moana_005_f
I didn't even know that was possible!

TAG: Moana_006_f
Are you going to follow her lead?

TAG: Moana_007_f
I don't think so. Exploring the ocean is just fine for me.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to explore just how tasty Tiana's beignets are!
