Hey Daisy, think you could help us out with something?

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Hades wants to be a celebrity andâ

TAG: Daisy_002_f
Whoa! Whoa. Not "wants" to be a celebrity â I am one! I just need a little help getting other people to recognize that.

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Well, to be a celebrity, you have to be famous.

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Check.

TAG: Daisy_005_f
You need to have fans who absolutely adore you. And you should TRY to do good things with your fame!

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Also check! Not so much with the "doing good things," but ALL IN on the "fans adoring me."

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Who adores you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The dead in the Underworld don't count.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not counting ancient Greek citizens.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Well, you, for instance. And I'm assuming others. C'mon, I'm a likeable guy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You sure about that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'd consider us acquaintances at best.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Of course I adore you â I want a good afterlife!

TAG: Daisy_024_f
What's not to like? I'm funny, charmingâ

TAG: Daisy_020_f
Sure, if you want cheap, badly madeâ

TAG: Daisy_021_f
Great, it's settled!

TAG: Daisy_022_f
*sigh* ... Fine, if you want cheap merchandise, then that's what we'll do.

TAG: Daisy_023_f
Does exactly what I say â now that's what I want from a manager! You're hired!

TAG: Daisy_012_f
Hmm, I think what you really need is a manager.

TAG: Daisy_013_f
A manager? Are you kidding?! I DON'T need to be managed.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Trust me. Being a celebrity is oodles of work. You have to constantly touch base with your fans.

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Toss a crumb to the admirers, got it.

TAG: Daisy_016_f
I say we start by brainstorming some merchandizing opportunities. Folks love to wear clothing with their favorite celebrities on them!

TAG: Daisy_017_f
We could also do water bottles, action figures, sandals...

TAG: Daisy_018_f
NO! That's what the goat's doing for Jerkcules. Let's... do t-shirts.

TAG: Daisy_019_f
I read you can produce 'em cheap and just rake in the dough.

TAG: Daisy_025_f
Yeah, yeah. You think I'd be actual friends with a MORTAL?

TAG: Daisy_026_f
Ugh, transactional fawning? I've had enough of that to last a few millennia.

TAG: Daisy_009_f
What?! Why not?!

TAG: Daisy_010_f
What was it you were saying again about ironic consequences?

TAG: Daisy_011_f
I KNOW! Besides, I've given up on those ingrates. They're totally obsessed with Zeus.
