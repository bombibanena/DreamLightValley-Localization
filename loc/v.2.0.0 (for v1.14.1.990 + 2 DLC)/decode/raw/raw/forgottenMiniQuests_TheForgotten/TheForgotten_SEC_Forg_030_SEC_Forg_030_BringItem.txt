Wow... what is all this stuff?

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
Just what we need to make a special poetry corner for you.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
Really? This is great!

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
... But I'm kinda nervous. I've never spoken in front of so many people before.

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
What do you do when you're nervous?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I take deep breaths.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let myself freak out... but only a little bit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Try to pretend that feeling is really excitement.

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
I'll try it.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
Ahem... <Lore>"And now, at last, I've found my place..."</Lore>

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
"...my old mistakes have been erased."

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
"...and a best friend who shares my face."

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
"...in a Village like a warm embrace."

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
...

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
...

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Wow! That actually helps!

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
Okay, let's put this together...

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
This is looking great! Ready to share your poems with the Village?

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
There's one last favor I gotta ask...

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
I added a new line to the end of the poem. It's... kinda about you, and being back in Dreamlight Valley. I was hoping you could help me finish it.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
I love it. It really does feel like the time I've spent with you... I've been able to fix so much of what went wrong.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
The poem's finally finished. If you can <Lore>set this up</Lore>, we'll be good to go!

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
... Best friend? Oh. Wow. I've never had a best friend before. ... Thank you.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Oh! That's great. I'll bet Olaf will like that one.

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Huh. Okay. I'll try it. Ten second freak-out, starting...

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
...NOW!

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
What if I mess up?! What if I embarrass myself in front of everybody?! What if people laugh?! What if I trip and fall over onto Goofy?! What if Iâ

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
Time's up!

TAG: TheForgotten_022_f
... I actually feel a little better. Wow!

TAG: TheForgotten_023_f
Now that I think about it... I guess being anxious and being excited DO feel kind of similar.

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
Okay. I'm going to change how I think about this.

TAG: TheForgotten_025_f
I am EXCITED to read my poems to the other Villagers.

TAG: TheForgotten_026_f
I am SO TOTALLY NOT AFRAID that I'll make a big fool of myself.

TAG: TheForgotten_027_f
I am THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF TERRIFIED!!!

TAG: TheForgotten_028_f
Let's not go overboard.

TAG: TheForgotten_029_f
Right, right... but I actually do feel a little better.
