Oh! Hey, {PlayerName}.

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
You wanted to talk to me...? Did I do something wrong...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course not!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Just checking in.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
As long as you haven't torn open reality again, I think we're good.

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
I'm just visiting to see how you're doing!

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
Say, I do remember a few things in the Village that I used to think were really beautiful.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
There was this <Lore>one yellow flower in the Forgotten Lands</Lore> that was really cool.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
And there was this <Lore>really neat bird with dark feathers</Lore>!

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Oh, and I think the most awesome thing in the whole Valley is that <Lore>giant skull near Dazzle Beach</Lore>! I bet you could get a pretty good shot of that.

TAG: Player_001_f
So your idea of beauty is... flowers, birds, and giant skulls.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I love it!!! Me too.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Very unconventional choices, but I support them.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
Oh. It's... really nice of you to actually care.

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
I'm doing okay. Everyone in the Village has been so nice.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
But... I don't know... today I'm feeling a little... bored? Or like... everything I look at today, it just feels so... boring and ordinary.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
I remember when we were younger, everything was cool and exciting and beautiful. I wish I could see things that way again.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Well, everything can be beautiful if you look at it in the right way.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
So... it all depends on how you frame it?

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
Frame it...! That's it! Why don't we <Lore>take some pictures</Lore> to show you how beautiful even ordinary things around the Village can be?

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
That could be fun!

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Oh, wow, really? It's nice to have somebody around who understands.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Let's see what we can do. <Lore>Three pictures</Lore>, coming right up!

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Aw, thanks.

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
Don't worry. I definitely won't be making THAT mistake twice...

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
Phewf. That's a relief.

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
But really... I just wanted to see how you're adjusting.
