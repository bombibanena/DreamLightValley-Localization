I'll keep looking for Villagers who can help!

<Lore>I once was the ruler of all I surveyed...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
<Lore>But now I'm cast out and I feel so afraid.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
<Lore>Nothing I do seems to make the world right...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
Something something... that rhymes with "right."

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
<Lore>As I watch the clock tick and the sun rise and set...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
<Lore>I fear what I love, I am doomed to forget.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
<Lore>But I've never been one to do what I'm told...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Then I need a line that rhymes with "told."

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
<Lore>It seems there's no place I will ever belong...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
<Lore>And all of my words seem to come out all wrong.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
<Lore>But I'll wait for an answer, I'll wait for a sign...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Yada, yada, yada... something that rhymes with "sign."

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Thanks â I'd ask myself but... I'm feeling a little shy.
