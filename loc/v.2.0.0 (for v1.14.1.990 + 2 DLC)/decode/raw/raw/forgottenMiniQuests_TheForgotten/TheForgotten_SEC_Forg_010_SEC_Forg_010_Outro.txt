You made such a nice place for me in your House, {PlayerName}.

TAG: TheForgotten_000_f
I... I don't even know what to say.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You don't need to say anything at all!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
"Thank you" would be a good start.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
I just wanted to make you feel more at home.

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
I think this is the most at home I've felt in... forever.

I'm sure glad you came back to Dreamlight Valley. It feels like part of me that's been missing is finally back.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm starting to feel the same way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Hey, no worries. It's just what I do!

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
I'll see you around. I'm suddenly pretty excited to explore the Valley and see what else I find...

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
I guess even an ordinary day can be kind of magical, huh?

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
Oh, speaking of something magical... I've got a surprise to thank you!

Remy's been teaching me how to bake! I wanted to make something for us to share... or you can just eat 'em all yourself.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
I'm not very good at it yet. But I hope you like them. Remy says it's an old recipe of Minnie's!

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
Oh! Right! Uh. Thank you.

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
I appreciate it so much.
