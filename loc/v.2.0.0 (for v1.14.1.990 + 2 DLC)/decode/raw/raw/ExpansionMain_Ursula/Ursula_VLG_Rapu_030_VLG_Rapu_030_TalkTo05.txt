Hey, Ursula. I found some Sundrop Petals. Can you create an <ActivityItem>Eternal Sundrop Charm</ActivityItem> for Mother Gothel?

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Well well, {PlayerName}, I had no idea you were Gothel's little errand minion now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm helping Rapunzel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I help everyone who needs it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This is a one-time thing.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
What does that blonde slip of seagrass have to do with this?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're just suspicious. There's no secret.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's not my secret to tell.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Rapunzel is a marionette brought to life by magic.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
... Well... She wants to help Mother Gothel, so I'm helping her search. That's all.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
I see...

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Just tell me what else we need to make the charm.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Since you have the petals, it should be simple. <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>... <ActivityItem>Evergems</ActivityItem> that capture the light of the past...

TAG: Ursula_007_f
A few <ActivityItem>Skeleton Fish</ActivityItem>... and of course, my payment.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
... What do you want?

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Rapunzel's secret.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
There's something special about that waifish little guppy, and Gothel won't tell me what it is.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Oh, I don't buy that for a second, dearie. You think you can keep the truth from me?

TAG: Ursula_012_f
No, but I had to try...

TAG: Ursula_013_f
If you're NOT going to provide payment, then leave! No payment, no charm!

TAG: Ursula_014_f
You know what? I've got the list of Ingredients now... I bet I can make this myself.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Feeling like a big fish in a small pond, are we? Just remember Gothel will be furious if you make even one little mistake.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Guess I better make sure to get it right. Thanks, Ursula!

TAG: Ursula_017_f
You're not welcome.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
It's up to Rapunzel to decide whether she wants to share or not.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
How sweet. Well...

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Oh come now; don't try pulling MY strings.

TAG: Ursula_021_f
Well, if you're being so generous with your time, you should ask me if I need anything...

TAG: Ursula_022_f
I've helped you out plenty, Ursula... I got you out of your cave, remember?

TAG: Ursula_023_f
That again? Angelfish, your credit for that ran out tides ago.

TAG: Ursula_024_f
I don't work for Mother Gothel.

TAG: Ursula_025_f
And yet you're here, and not the blonde slip of seagrass she calls "daughter." Interesting...

TAG: Ursula_026_f
Can we focus, please?
