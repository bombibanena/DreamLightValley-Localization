Now, what's this, {PlayerName}? Are you looking to trade me for something?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Nope! They're flowers, just for being you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I thought you might be able to use them for your potions.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I've done a favor for you... so someday, you can do a favor for me.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Ha! I knew there was a reason you're my favorite.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
These will make very useful potions. They're practically oozing with potential.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Just don't use them for evil, okay?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Think you could make something useful for me?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Perish the thought.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
And just to show you how generous I am...

TAG: Ursula_009_f
As a little thank-you... a potion that's sure to keep your crops thriving!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I imagine so, though it might take some time.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
But here... Have something to tide you over.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
How thoughtful!

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Ha-ha-ha-ha! You're learning well, angelfish.
