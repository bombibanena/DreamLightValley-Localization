You want something...?

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Oh, yes, I do!

<Forgotten>(Ugh. What's it going to be this time...)</Forgotten>

TAG: Minnie_004_f
I just wanted to tell you...

TAG: Minnie_005_f
...that you're loved.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What? I am?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's pretty cheesy...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Of course! Everyone here cares so much about you.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
You mustn't be afraid to let your friends know how you feel. Even if you might feel a little silly doing it.

(I wish I could disappear.)

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
(I feel like I'm stuck in between...)

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
(Something is wrong...)

TAG: Minnie_010_f
...{PlayerName}?

TAG: Minnie_011_f
It's fine. I'm fine. Thanks for the talk...

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Yes. I think that everyone needs to hear that they're cared about now and then, don't you?

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Well... maybe it is. But it's true. And I think it's all right to be a little cheesy, especially when something is important!
