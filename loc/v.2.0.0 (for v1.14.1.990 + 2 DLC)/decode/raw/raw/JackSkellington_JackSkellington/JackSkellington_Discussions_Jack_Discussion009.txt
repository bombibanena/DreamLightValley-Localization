{PlayerName}, would you like to join me in some screaming practice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, thanks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Screaming practice?!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Marvelous! Now we'll start easy. A basic yelp.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Ahhhh!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Argh!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Yip!

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Very good! Try another yell, but longer this time.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Ahhhhhhhh!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
AhhhhHHHhhHHHhhh!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Now higher! A proper curdling scream!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I think I'm done, thanks.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Eeeeeeeeee!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Eiiiiiiieeee!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Until next time!

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
That sent shivers down my spine â exquisitely done!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Oh, I like the ululation â a terrifying touch!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Close! But that's a yip, not a yelp.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Try another yell, but longer this time.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
All right. Perhaps you'd like to simply observe...

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
YYYEEAAAAARRRGHHHH!

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Yes, even if one has no vocal chords, one must keep one's voice in prime condition for blood curdling screams.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Constant practice is essential. Care to join me?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
No, thanks.
