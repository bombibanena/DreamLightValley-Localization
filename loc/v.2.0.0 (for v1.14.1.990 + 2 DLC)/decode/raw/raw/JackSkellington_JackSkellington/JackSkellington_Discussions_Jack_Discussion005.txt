Friend, I'm sure you've heard that I once tried my hand at running Christmas. Alas, it was quite the disaster.

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
I made so many mistakes, but I'm wondering if there was one fundamental flaw...

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
A central confusion. A core to all the calamity.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe you didn't really understand Christmas.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe you let your excitement run away from you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't know enough to say.

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
I think you're right. But oh how I wanted to! Oh how I tried!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
My longing was so intense that I convinced myself I understood it.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Yes. I believe that was the root of my foolishness.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Does that mean that you've learned your lesson?

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Of course. Hmm... but say I hadn't learned my lesson. Would that SCARE you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm not going to answer that.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Well, then perhaps... I've learned nothing at all! Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
I see... I'll have to take that into consideration when designing future frights for you.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
How clever!

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
I certainly did. Enthusiasm is quite powerful.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
And usually it's good! It animates my frights! Keeps me inspired.

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
But it can sometimes... have a life of its own.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Such modesty will serve you well.

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
It'll keep you from thinking you know more than you do.

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
And from doing more than you ought. I could learn from you!
