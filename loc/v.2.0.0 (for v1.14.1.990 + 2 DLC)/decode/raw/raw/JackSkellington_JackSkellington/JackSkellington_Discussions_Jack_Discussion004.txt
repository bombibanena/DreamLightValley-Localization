{PlayerName}! I need your help thinking up some new ideas for Halloween.

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
You know, fresh insights. Topical terrors. Contemporary creepiness.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Vampires.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Haunted animatronics.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Going to the dentist.

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
You're right! Vampires have been experiencing a sort of renaissance.

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Which is charming, as many of them were around for the Renaissance!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
But I do have colleagues back in Halloween Town who are vampires.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
So I feel that territory is well-covered.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Hmm... Yes, I see the possibilities!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Strangely human in effect, but we make the movements odd and jerky. Oh, and no eyes! That's always affective.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
I could practice moving like that. And perhaps create a costume!

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Yes, I've heard that many humans are terrified of dentists.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
But that fear is not really the fun Halloween fright I'm going for.
