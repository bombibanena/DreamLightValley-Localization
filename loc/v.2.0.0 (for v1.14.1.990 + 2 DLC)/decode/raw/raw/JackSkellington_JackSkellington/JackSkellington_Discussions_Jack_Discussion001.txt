{PlayerName}, I've been considering recruiting new fright-makers for Halloween.

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Do any of our Valley friends strike you as particularly scary?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe Merlin?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Definitely Ursula.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What about Goofy?

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Merlin? Oh, he's not scary at all! Though, I do think he has other Halloween potential.

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Consider the special effects he could make!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Oh, so sort of a behind-the-scenes support staff kind of thing?

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Exactly!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Well, good luck with the search!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
A witch? That's perfect! And she has such a majestic presence.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Oh... but she'll likely want something in exchange for working with us.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
True, I guess you'd want someone who's in it for the joy of scaring people.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Oh, but he's so endearing!

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Though I am occasionally afraid he'll trip and hurt himself...

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
...but that's not really the sort of fear I'm looking for.

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Fair!
