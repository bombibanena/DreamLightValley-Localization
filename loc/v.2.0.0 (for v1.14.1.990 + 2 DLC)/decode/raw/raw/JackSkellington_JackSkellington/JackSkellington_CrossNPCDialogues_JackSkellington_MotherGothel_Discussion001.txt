Tell me, madam... What sort of things do you find most frightening?

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Oh, you silly skeleton! Why would I ever tell you that?

It's my job. My vocation. You might even say it's my calling!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
But that doesn't mean I have to tell you.

Usually, I have a sense for these things... Does it involve... a fear of aging...?

*gasp* ... Oh... um... don't be ridiculous, dear. Why would I fear that when I'm doing it so beautifully?!
