Here you go, Jack â six <ActivityItem>Night Shards</ActivityItem> as promised.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
You're just in time, {PlayerName}! I've had a breakthrough!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Jack, that's wonderful!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Should I be worried?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hold on, let me hide the wrapping paper.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
I haven't been this excited since I discovered Christmas Town.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
So what's this breakthrough?

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
I could tell you... but I'd much rather show you.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Let me just grind down those Shards to powder... add them in... stir... and there!

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Ha-ha! I think I've outdone myself this time.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
A Giant Night Thorn! Isn't it beautiful?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's very impressive, but...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Aggghhh! No!

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
This is a problem for the Village.

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
I told you this was a bad idea!

TAG: JackSkellington_028_f
Oh no, I'm afraid you've lost magical-ingredient privileges for the time being. I'm going to <Lore>talk to Merlin about this</Lore>.

TAG: JackSkellington_029_f
Well, if you must...

TAG: JackSkellington_030_f
OK, I'm off â please try to avoid making any new Night Thorns, OK?

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
What's wrong with my Night Thorn?

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
I worked so hard to keep these from taking over the Valley...

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
Left unchecked, it will multiply and spread the Forgetting everywhere!

TAG: JackSkellington_023_f
Oh... well, that certainly was not my intent.

TAG: JackSkellington_024_f
I know, but now we have to deal with this.

TAG: JackSkellington_025_f
Hmm, perhaps with a few more Night Shards, I could come up withâ

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
I was curious about what you were planning, but this?!

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
This is very bad, Jack!

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Of course not! I'm merely experimenting with magic.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Oh, don't worry. This has nothing to do with Christmas... At least, I don't believe so.
