{PlayerName}, I've been ruminating on our traditional Halloween themes...

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Scary skeletons. Jack-o'-lanterns. Tell me â do you have a favorite?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Witches.

Skeletons.

Creepy clowns.

Marvelous! Witches have such flexibility â they can be creepy cacklers with a cauldron...

Or ominous silhouettes in front of the moon!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Exactly! Witches can fit into any Halloween motif. Why, they're practically indispensable.

How delightful! Or are you flattering me? You don't need to do that, you know.

But I do love a good bone rattle. And no one can grin like a skeleton can!

They are very popular! I surmise it's the exaggerated human characteristics.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
You assume a clown is going to be silly and funny...

But then â oh no! It doesn't have a face!
