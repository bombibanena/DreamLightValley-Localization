It's time! It's finally here!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
{PlayerName}, are you ready for the first annual Dreamlight Day?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes! Let's do it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not yet â I'll be back.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
I'm pleased to report that the Dreamlight Day surprises are finally ready!

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Yeah, about that... What final little modifications did you make to them?

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Well, after some careful experimentation, I was able to extract some magic from the small Night Thorn...

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Hey, I thought I told you not to mess with Dark Magic like that!

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Oh, don't worry, {PlayerName}! Thanks to your efforts with Merlin's potion, my Night Thorn isn't evil anymore! Perhaps a little mischievous, but certainly not evil.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's actually kinda cool.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I've got my eye on you...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I really don't trust that thing.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
I agree!

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Sure, see you later, Jack!

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Now then, there are far more important things to discuss than my potted plant.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Dreamlight Day is upon us! Can I entrust decorations to you while I deliver the surprises?

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
Sure, as long as you don't go all evil-Santa on me.

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
I assure you, it will be quite different from that unfortunate endeavor.

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
I'll leave the specifics of the decorations up to you, but I'd suggest you use the following theme.

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
<ActivityItem>Orange</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Black</ActivityItem> decorations and furnishings with an emphasis on things you might classify as <ActivityItem>Quirky</ActivityItem>. We'll also need lighting.

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Then if you <Lore>take a picture of the Launch Ribbon</Lore>, we'll have a memento of the event!

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
You do? I wasn't aware you could remove your eyeballs.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
I understand. But I give you my word: Everything will be fine.
