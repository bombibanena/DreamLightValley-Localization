Are... are you Jack Skellington?!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
I can't believe that you're here! I know all about you and Halloween Town.

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Why, that's wonderful! I remember my time here fondly.

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Are you the one who called me back here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure am!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I... guess?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think it was Oogie Boogie.

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Well, thank you for the call!

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
I'm extremely happy to be back!

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
Dreamlight Valley is always in need of the kind of fright only I can supply.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm so happy to have you back!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Tell me about your journey!

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
What a lovely welcome!

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
I felt the reverberations of magic when the Valley began to be inhabited again.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
But I got trapped in the holiday travel path when I attempted to return.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
How strange â maybe the holiday magic had some unexpected interactions with Dreamlight Magic?

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Regardless, I'm happy to have you back in the Village!

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Marvelous! Well now, there's work to be done!

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
First off, could you help me get settled?

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Sure! Let's <Lore>find a good place for you to live</Lore>.

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Oh, I'd be happy to.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Oh, don't worry. Holiday magic can be confusing at times.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Yeah, I'm only familiar with Dreamlight Magic for now.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
What?! He's here?!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Nah, I'm just kidding around.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Thank goodness! Nothing good ever comes from having him around. Now then...
