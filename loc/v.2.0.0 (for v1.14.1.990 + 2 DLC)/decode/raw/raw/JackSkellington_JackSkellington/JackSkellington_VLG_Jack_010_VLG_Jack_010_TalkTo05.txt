Jack... I replaced the ingredients for the potions you messed up in Ursula's House.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
You have my word!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}.

I didn't mean to make a mess, but those potions were just so unique. I couldn't resist experimenting.

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Well, I guess we should count ourselves lucky that nothing went catastrophically wrong.

But Ursula can have a bit of a mean streak sometimes â I'd be careful around her.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Thank you for the warning. I'll keep that in mind.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
She did mention that someone here has a house made from a pumpkin? How fascinating!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Yup! That's the Fairy Godmother.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
I can take you for a little visit, just... be on your best behavior, OK?
