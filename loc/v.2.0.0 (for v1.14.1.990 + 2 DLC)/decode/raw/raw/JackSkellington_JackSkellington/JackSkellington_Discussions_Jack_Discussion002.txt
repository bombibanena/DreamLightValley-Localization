{PlayerName}, my search for new Halloween fright-makers continues!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Do you have any new suggestions for me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Stitch!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Scar would be great.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What about Remy?

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Ah, yes! I've had my eye on that creature for quite some time.

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
I'm sure he could craft some marvelous jump scares!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
A chance to pursue mischief without raising his badness level?

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
I'm sure Stitch would love it!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Now that cat has real potential to be terrifying!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
If only he weren't so cruel about it...

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Halloween is about scaring people, not hurting their feelings!

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Indeed, some people are scared of rats.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
But I'm afraid that role might hurt Remy's feelings.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Perhaps he could cater Halloween instead...

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
I'm sure he knows a ton of candy recipes!
