Got your kit ready! Is it science time?

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
{PlayerName}, I knew I could count on you!

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
How was your talk with Merlin?

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Very productive.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
We discussed Dreamlight Magic, planetary alignments and etheric crystallization.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Dreamlight Magic is pretty special.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Any particular planets?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Etheric crystallization? What's that?

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
And quite different from Halloween magic.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Do you know what you're going to investigate?

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Well, the Shards that manifest here are particularly intriguing.

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Merlin specifically mentioned <ActivityItem>Night Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
Do you think you could find some for me?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're interested in Night Shards?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's Dark Magic, Jack â be careful.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Exactly! The magics I'm familiar with are considered dark, having to do with chills and frights. But the Dark Magics here, though similar, are quite mystifying.

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
Well, then you must be the perfect person to do experiments on them!

TAG: JackSkellington_023_f
That's just what I was thinking!

TAG: JackSkellington_025_f
All right, I'll fetch you some <ActivityItem>Night Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: JackSkellington_026_f
Excellent! Six of them should be fine. I'll <Lore>meet you back in the Vitalys Mines</Lore> afterwards.

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
{PlayerName}, I am a scientist! Nay, a visionary!

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
I'm just saying... be careful.

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
Of course â I shall be the epitome of conscientiousness.

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Jack, you must admit that you have a bit of a tendency to leap before you look.

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Oh no, that's all in the past! I assure you.

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
OK, OK, I'll let you do your thing... just don't say I didn't warn you.

TAG: JackSkellington_024_f
I wouldn't dream of it, {PlayerName}.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Well, there are a number of them that don't yet have names, so it's difficult to say.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
It's when magical energies take solid form.
