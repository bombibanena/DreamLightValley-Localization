Hey, just who I was hoping to see! I'm back in the Valley Guardian game, and I know exactly who I wanna help first. You ready for it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Who do you want to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm a little busy now...

TAG: Mushu_002_f
The Beast!

TAG: Mushu_003_f
I have never seen anyone that big try to make themself so SMALL â metaphorically speaking.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How do you want to help him?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
He's just a little shy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He's a big, fluffy mess.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
I thought you'd never ask.

TAG: Mushu_009_f
When I try to talk to him, he won't look me in the eye. Plus, he's always mumbling. I get the feeling he lacks self-confidence, which just breaks my little dragon heart.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
And that's why I want â no â NEED him to be the first participant in M.U.S.H.U.!

TAG: Mushu_008_f
That stands for "Mighty Universal Self Help Unit." A special program I've invented to help Villagers through Analysis, Action, and Immersion.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Analysis?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Action?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Immersion?

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
I'll talk to the Beast.

TAG: Mushu_013_f
The first step in the program. Trying to understand the one you're helping by figuring out what they're going through.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Action is step two. We take what we learned about our subject and find actions they can do to get 'em feeling better right away.

TAG: Mushu_015_f
By the time we reach step three â Immersion â we know what's going on with our friend, and we've helped 'em feel better... At least a little.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Then it's time to really dig in to see what's going on.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Great! I think he knows I'm onto him because he's been avoiding me.

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Ooh, you and me doing Guardian things together? I love it!

TAG: Mushu_004_f
You're right. Some folks are shy, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this is different.

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Well, I wouldn't go that far, but I'm glad we both see it. That guy needs our help.

TAG: Mushu_001_f
I get it. Just come find me later, all right?
