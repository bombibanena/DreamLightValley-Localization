Mushu, you were totally right. Scar is bullying the other small Villagers.

TAG: Mushu_002_f
Well... everyone except Stitch â but only because Stitch explained he's got lasers.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
I knew it! What did the rest of 'em say?

He's just causing tiny terror in general!

TAG: Mushu_004_f
...that Scar keeps "accidentally" knocking him into mud puddles... and laughing.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
Ooh, you're gonna have to hold me back! My blood's starting to boil!

TAG: Mushu_005_f
...Scar wanted to play hide-and-seek, but when he found Woody, he chased him around for a whole afternoon and snapped his teeth whenever he got close!

TAG: Mushu_009_f
Egregious use of teeth! Not on my watch!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Scar's been sending back his last bite of food so he doesn't have to pay in the restaurant.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
When Remy asked Scar about it, he called Remy a "mere rodent" and knocked his plate onto the ground, breaking it.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Come on. I don't even GO to restaurants and I know that's rude!

TAG: Mushu_007_f
We are putting an end to this!

TAG: Mushu_016_f
I'm gonna form a tiny Villagers society. I wanna get everyone together and let 'em know I've got this under control!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're a great leader, Mushu.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Your motto can be "small but mighty"!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
A tiny society? SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!

TAG: Mushu_018_f
Well, thank you! I did teach Mulan everything she knows.

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Now, for a proper meeting, we're gonna need <ActivityItem>Tiny Chairs</ActivityItem>. Everything around here is HUGE. Not exactly built for us small folks.

TAG: Mushu_013_f
Ooh, and some pint-sized snacks, too! A professional meeting's gotta have a spread, even if just a few partake.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
All right, Mushu! I'll build some <ActivityItem>Tiny Chairs</ActivityItem>. You go invite the other Villagers to the meeting.

TAG: Mushu_015_f
We'll worry about snacks after.

TAG: Mushu_017_f
Hey, that's pretty good!

TAG: Mushu_019_f
Cute? No! Organized, united, and yes, tiny! ... Okay, fine, it's KINDA cute.
