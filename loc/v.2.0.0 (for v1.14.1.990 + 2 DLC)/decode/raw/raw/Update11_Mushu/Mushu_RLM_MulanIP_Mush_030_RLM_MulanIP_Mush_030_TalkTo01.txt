Our dragon masterpieces are off to protect China! And my to-do list is finished!

Oh, but you and me â we're not done, {PlayerName}. Mulan told me you're not a REAL recruit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sorry for the deception.

Are you mad?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f

TAG: Mushu_015_f
Got a little lost, went on a little nature walk...

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Musta dropped it. That key's GOTTA be around there somewhere.

TAG: Mushu_013_f
I'll look for the <ActivityItem>Key</ActivityItem>, Mushu. Don't worry!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
No... A little disappointed at myself that I didn't see through it. But not mad.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
