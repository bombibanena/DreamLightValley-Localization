Hey, Mushu. Mulan's having trouble finding hobbies in the Valley.

TAG: Mushu_001_f
Well, I'm glad she went to you for help. But I'm less glad it's not working. Tell me what happened.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We picked flowers and...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...we made a vegetable garden and...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...everything we tried turned into strategy.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
She wanted to turn them into some sort of... camouflage mat?

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Ooh, that's so CREATIVE!

TAG: Mushu_005_f
And not the point of fun! She works so HARD, she needs to relax. Let loose!

TAG: Mushu_002_f
She was talking about preserving them to make rations.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Or making targets with pumpkins?

TAG: Mushu_008_f
I hear you. All focus. That girl sure is DEDICATED, isn't she?

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Hmm... Let me ask you something...

TAG: Mushu_009_f
When Mulan was doing this stuff, what kinda mood was she in?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Happy! Until she realized she was strategizing again.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Kind of upset; she kept chasing challenges.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I have no idea.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Okay... Having fun till you realize you're not having "fun."

TAG: Mushu_013_f
{PlayerName}, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Mulan's fun IS training and strategy!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
... Probably. But YOU say it first.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Bao are delicious?

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Ha, I KNEW we thought alike!

TAG: Mushu_015_f
Mulan has FUN making these plans and strategies and camo-target-ration-majigs.

TAG: Mushu_017_f
She LOVES challenges. It's how she blows off steam!

TAG: Mushu_018_f
That... actually makes sense. How do we make sure she can train and strategize in a place where there's no one to train AGAINST?

TAG: Mushu_019_f
I've got an idea. Let's start by building a couple <ActivityItem>Wooden Training Dummies</ActivityItem>. By the time you're done with that, I'll have it all planned out!

TAG: Mushu_016_f
Okay, I definitely wasn't thinking THAT. But if you need a snack break, go ahead.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
But she kept coming back to making challenges for herself? Huh.

TAG: Mushu_012_f
I bet she was happy 'til she realized she was back in her same old habit.
