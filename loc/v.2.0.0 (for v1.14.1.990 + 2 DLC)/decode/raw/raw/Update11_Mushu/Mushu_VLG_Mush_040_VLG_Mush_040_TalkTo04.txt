Okay, I'm gonna go give Scar a good talking to. A piece of my mind! Explain the sitch! That'll make him back off!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Something tells me that won't work...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Skeptical, but love the confidence.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think Scar thinks you're snack-sized.

TAG: Mushu_002_f
What?! I'm a Guardian. He HAS to listen to me!

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Scar barely takes ME seriously, Mushu. He needs something big â a show of power!

TAG: Mushu_005_f
Mulan told me when you first met her that you put on a BIG show, with fire and shadows...

TAG: Mushu_006_f
No. No way. I wasn't a Guardian then. I don't wanna use tricks anymore.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's the only way Scar will listen.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's not a trick. It's an illusion!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We can do it together!

TAG: Mushu_008_f
Hmm... All right. But we're only doing this because YOU'RE a mortal who needs my help.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Of course, Mushu! What do we need?

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Let me think... Oh, right! We need a nice, strong <ActivityItem>Hand Fan</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mushu_013_f
I thought I saw one lying around <ActivityItem>the training camp back where we met</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Go get it for me, and then we can get started.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Illusions take SKILL, and work, and effort. There's nothing tricky about that!

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Okay. We can do it. As long as YOU know that I don't need tricks to be convincing. It's only because YOU want a show.

TAG: Mushu_009_f
Hmm... Well, we ARE a team...

TAG: Mushu_001_f
Listen: One lecture from me and he'll be set right.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Well, he'll find out I may be small, but I am MIGHTY!
