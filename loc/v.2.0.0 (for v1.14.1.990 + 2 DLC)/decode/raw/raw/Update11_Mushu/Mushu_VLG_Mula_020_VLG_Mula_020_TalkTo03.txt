This is ridiculous! I'm a Guardian! I never run outta fire. How come this crazy theater lamp won't stay lit?!

TAG: Mushu_002_f
Oh! Heh-heh. {PlayerName}, didn't see you there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
... You all right, Mushu?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What seems to be the problem?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You can't light one tiny little lantern?

TAG: Mushu_004_f
I'm fine. It's the lantern that's got problems!

TAG: Mushu_000_f
It goes out WAY too fast.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
So it might go out in the middle of the show?

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Yeah. And that would NOT be good.

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Of course, this isn't the first shadow play we've put on in the Valley. We used to do lots of 'em before the Forgetting.

TAG: Mushu_013_f
And back then, our lantern had a special light source that never went out... Some sorta magic I'm not exactly familiar with.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Magical oddity, huh? Time to go speak to Merlin.

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Well, I can light the lantern for the shadow play...

TAG: Mushu_007_f
The problem is: It won't stay lit!
