Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Who are you?

TAG: Mushu_001_f
Me? I'm {PlayerName}! Nice to meet you!

TAG: Mushu_002_f
Well, {PlayerName}, how'd you find this training camp? It's supposed to be hidden. Secret. Incognito!

TAG: Mushu_003_f
*GASP* I get it! You're a spy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm not a spy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Would a spy walk right into your camp?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're so suspicious. Relax!

TAG: Mushu_007_f
That's exactly what a spy would say!

TAG: Mushu_008_f
I promise I'm not...

TAG: Mushu_009_f
Ah-ah-ah! Quiet, spy!

TAG: Mushu_010_f
I know you're a spy because I have a list of the recruits we're supposed to train and...

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Wait. What's that?

TAG: Mushu_026_f
There's a name at the bottom of the list. It's smudged, but it could be... {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mushu_027_f
Okay. Okay. You're not a spy. But you're late!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Well... What do you have to say for yourself?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yes, sir! I'm sorry, sir!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
There seems to be a little misunderstanding.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You're not the boss of me.

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Whoa. Whoa. No need to be so formal. I'm just making sure we respect the decorum of the setting. I know you defender types just LOVE your protocol.

TAG: Mushu_015_f
By the way, I'm Mushu.

TAG: Mushu_017_f
Nice to meet you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Mushu_018_f
Now I'll go back to calling you recruit â just play along. You'll be great.

TAG: Mushu_019_f
Ahem...

TAG: Mushu_020_f
So, recruit! You missed the Battle of the Rice Cauldron that marked the END of training.

TAG: Mushu_021_f
And since you're EXTREMELY late, you're gonna <Lore>clean up the camp</Lore>.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Message received, Sergeant Mushu.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Sure, I can clean up the camp.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I'll clean, but only because I've decided to.

TAG: Mushu_022_f
Sergeant Mushu. I like that!

TAG: Mushu_025_f
Now start breaking up the <ActivityItem>Rocks</ActivityItem> and digging up the <ActivityItem>Rice Spills</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mushu_030_f
Oh, and don't forget to <Lore>flip over the Cauldron</Lore>.

TAG: Mushu_023_f
Good. Don't take too long, okay?

TAG: Mushu_024_f
Hey, as long as somebody does it, and that somebody ISN'T me!

TAG: Mushu_013_f
No, I understand completely. You were late! And in this camp, you're gonna learn the importance of being on time. You'll see.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Oh, I get it... Insubordination!

TAG: Mushu_028_f
Well, that's not gonna fly here, recruit!

TAG: Mushu_029_f
(Except it kinda will because this isn't the army. I just always wanted to be one of those tough drill sergeant types. You're fine. Love the attitude.)
