Hey! {PlayerName}, we have got a serious problem! And its name is Scar!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What did he do now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm a little busy. Let's talk later.

TAG: Mushu_002_f
I see his reputation precedes him.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Well, that big bully has been on some kinda power trip lately.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
He's walking around like he owns the place! Strutting and snapping his teeth at Villagers less than half his size. I'm telling you: I don't like it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds like Scar.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Scar is just misunderstood.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
C'mon! We're Guardians here! We gotta investigate and put a stop to any nefarious goings-on.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
I'm gonna go keep an eye on Scar â do a little recon. Can you talk to <Lore>Woody, Buzz, Stitch, and Remy</Lore>? See if he's been bothering them?

TAG: Mushu_006_f
I'm on the case!

TAG: Mushu_009_f
Well, that is no excuse to treat other Villagers badly.

TAG: Mushu_001_f
All right. But don't be long! I got a metaphorical bone to pick with that lion.
