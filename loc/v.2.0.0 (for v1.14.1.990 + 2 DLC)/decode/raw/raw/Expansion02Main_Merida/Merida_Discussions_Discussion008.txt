Destiny? Oh, I learned that our fate lies within us.

TAG: Merida_001_f
You control your own future, not the other way around.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I agree completely!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think we are all predestined for things.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think life is a bit of both.

TAG: Merida_002_f
I'm glad!

TAG: Merida_003_f
If I hadn't taken control of my destiny, I don't know where I'd be now.

TAG: Merida_008_f
Where do you see your future taking you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I hope to continue helping the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
More adventures!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I have no idea.

TAG: Merida_009_f
I hope for that, too!

TAG: Merida_010_f
The Valley's a wondrous place thanks to your help.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Me too!

TAG: Merida_012_f
Life would be boring without a grand adventure now and again, eh?

TAG: Merida_013_f
Then you've got all the possibilities in the world! You just have to be brave enough to see them.

TAG: Merida_004_f
You do? I disagree.

TAG: Merida_005_f
My life would be so different if I hadn't taken control of my own destiny. I don't even want to think about it.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Hmm, that's interesting.

TAG: Merida_007_f
I think my mum would agree with you.
