You see these <Lore>Mossy Logs</Lore>? They're all over the place.

Lucky for us, you've got that <Lore>Royal Shovel</Lore>...

TAG: Merida_004_f
...and I've got another potion from the Library of Lore!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll shine up my Shovel!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How many potions did you find in there?!

TAG: Merida_007_f
That'd be grand!

When you're done <Lore>getting rid of those Mossy Logs</Lore>, I can tell you more of what I learned from my dad about tracking.

TAG: Merida_005_f
Now, I've just got to go have a wee chat with the Lorekeeper. Come find me when you're through!

This is the last one. There were a few other bottles lying about, but they were shattered. Wonder who made them all...? Anyway...
