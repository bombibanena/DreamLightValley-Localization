Och! Did you see those things, {PlayerName}?!

TAG: Merida_001_f
They remind me of the <ActivityItem>Will-o'-the-Wisps</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Will-o'-the-what?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What should we do?

TAG: Merida_002_f
Will-o'-the-WISPS!

TAG: Merida_003_f
Some say they lead you to your fate.

TAG: Merida_004_f

TAG: Merida_005_f
So what should we do?

TAG: Merida_006_f
There's something funny about these will-o'-the-wisps. Try <Lore>catching them</Lore> so we can get a closer look!

TAG: Merida_007_f
I wish my Royal Net worked on things other than Snippets. I guess I'll have to <Lore>catch them with my hands</Lore>.
