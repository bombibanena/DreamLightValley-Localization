If I remember, you do magic, right? But you're not a witch?

TAG: Merida_001_f
That's correct, my dear. I'm a fairy godmother. Would you like to see an enchantment?

TAG: Merida_002_f
Ah, no thank you. I've had my fill of magic.

I'd rather avoid spells and potions and all that comes with them, if you don't mind.
