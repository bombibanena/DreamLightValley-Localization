What's this?

TAG: Merida_002_f
I made it to the place all the clues pointed to. This was all I found inside.

It looks like Hades found it first... and left behind this note, just to taunt us.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Oh no! Hades might do something horrid with the treasure!

TAG: Merida_005_f
Don't worry, Merida. I'll <Lore>confront Hades</Lore> and get the treasure back.
