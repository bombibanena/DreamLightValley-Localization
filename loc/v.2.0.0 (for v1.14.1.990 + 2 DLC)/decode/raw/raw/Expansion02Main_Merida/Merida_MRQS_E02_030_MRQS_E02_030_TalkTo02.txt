So, how's your adventure going, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Merida_001_f
Let me guess... You've already sat Maleficent and Hades down for tea and gotten them to hash out their wee quarrel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Uh, yeah, definitely!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm getting there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not even close...

TAG: Merida_002_f
Ha-ha-ha! Och, I'm sorry, but that's too funny! You're brilliant, {PlayerName}, but no one's that skilled.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Now then, is there anything I can do to help?

TAG: Merida_005_f
Actually, you can. I stumbled upon something in Everafter.

TAG: Merida_006_f
It was a gateway to another trial, just like the ones in Mythopia.

TAG: Merida_008_f
But it seems that this one is caused by Maleficent's meddling... not Hades'.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Oh! I found one of those before all that clarty ink flooded the land!

TAG: Merida_010_f
You mean the one deep in that dark, strange forest, right?

TAG: Merida_011_f
Well, you'd best be careful, {PlayerName}. There's something not right in those woods.

TAG: Merida_012_f
I hear it howling sometimes. It's some sort of beast, like the wolves I used to see stalking the moors back home.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm not afraid of some wolf.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We should stick together, just to be safe.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe it's a friendly wolf...?

TAG: Merida_013_f
That's because YOU haven't heard its howls. This isn't a regular old wolf. It's a beast!

TAG: Merida_016_f
Come on. Let's go <Lore>take a look</Lore>. Together we'll have a better chance.

TAG: Merida_017_f
And I'll keep an arrow at the ready just in case you see something hairy with big teeth coming our way.

TAG: Merida_015_f
Aye. I agree!

TAG: Merida_014_f
You haven't heard it howling and snarling. It's a nasty, brutish beast. Trust me.

TAG: Merida_007_f
It looked like a kind of gateway, filled with ink. The Lorekeeper told me that it's a Fairy Tale Trial.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Och, don't worry. If you'd already gotten that mess all sorted, I'd be more than a bit suspicious.
