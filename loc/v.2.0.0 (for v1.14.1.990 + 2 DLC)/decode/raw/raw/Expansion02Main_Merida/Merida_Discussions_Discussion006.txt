Aye, a wee bit.

TAG: Merida_001_f
I can't decide what to do with my day.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe some archery?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You could get a bite to eat at Remy's restaurant.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why don't you take a stroll and just enjoy the fresh air?

TAG: Merida_002_f
Hmm... I suppose I could use a bit more practice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Practice makes perfect!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're already an excellent archer.

TAG: Merida_007_f
You're right!

TAG: Merida_008_f
I wouldn't have won all the archery contests that I have without practicing.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Merida_009_f
Thank you!

TAG: Merida_010_f
There's not much I love more than the feel of my bow in my hands, and the sound of an arrow whistling through the wind.

TAG: Merida_003_f
That's a grand idea!

TAG: Merida_004_f
I am practically starving, now that you mention it.

TAG: Merida_005_f
I do love being outdoors. A stroll it is!

TAG: Merida_011_f
Maybe I'll even find a cavern to explore or a wisp to chase along the way.
