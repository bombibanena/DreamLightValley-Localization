Did you see that?! The last of the Lorekeeper's magic just flew out of her in those <Lore>Snippets</Lore>!

TAG: Player_000_f
You mean the little paper bird thingies that flew out of her...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They were sort of cute!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What were those things?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are those things dangerous...?

TAG: Merida_002_f
Cute?! The skeerie slips are annoying is what they are!

TAG: Merida_005_f
They've been flying all over the Vale ever since the Lorekeeper got sick.

TAG: Merida_006_f
She told me they're snippets of her Story Magic come to life. So I'm calling them <ActivityItem>Snippets</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Unless we can catch them all and stuff them back inside the Lorekeeper, she's done for.

TAG: Merida_012_f
Only trouble is, they're magic! Which means I can't catch them with my bare hands or shoot them out of the air with an arrow. Trust me, I've tried.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Maybe I can catch them. I don't know if you've noticed, but... I'm pretty magical.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Have you tried offering them a snack? I would definitely be tricked if you offered me a snack.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Well, I guess we're doomed then. Time to give up forever and go take a nap.

TAG: Merida_000_f
About that... I don't mean to insult you, since you seem nice enough, but the Lorekeeper told me that the only way to catch them is with the <Lore>Royal Net</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_019_f
Now where did I leave that potion...? Must be in my <Lore>bag, which is... somewhere in here</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_015_f
The Lorekeeper mentioned something about a <Lore>Royal Net</Lore> hidden here in this chamber!

TAG: Merida_009_f
Aye! <Lore>That's exactly what we need</Lore>. She said it was in here?

TAG: Merida_010_f
That's perfect! She told me once that only two people can wield its magic... and YOU'RE one of them.

TAG: Merida_011_f
We've got to find it. Let's <Lore>look around</Lore>...

TAG: Merida_008_f
Oh! Maybe there's something <Lore>underneath all that Petrified Wood</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_016_f
Maybe my Pickaxe can take care of that...

TAG: Merida_017_f
Pickaxe?! I found <Lore>a potion</Lore> while I was exploring a while back.

TAG: Merida_018_f
It's supposed to be for a Pickaxe. And I didn't have a Pickaxe. But YOU do!

TAG: Merida_014_f
I've tried everything and nothing worked! The Lorekeeper says they can only be captured with the <Lore>Royal Net</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_013_f
Give up? No member of Clan DunBroch ever gives up! We can solve this. We only need to find <Lore>the Royal Net</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Wee annoyances are what those were.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Dangerous? I don't think so. But they are annoying, that's for sure.
