It's good you're here, {PlayerName}! Hades is up to one of his schemes. I don't suppose you'd want to help me foil it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'd love nothing more!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not really in a scheme-foiling mood.

TAG: Merida_006_f
So, Hades came to me and asked me to help him find something.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Something I supposedly hid back before the Forgetting.

TAG: Merida_008_f
It's somewhere in the Vale, and it's an artifact that lets whoever holds it "change their fate."

TAG: Merida_009_f
He said it's an artifact connected to Clan DunBroch!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Why would someone want to change their fate?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Ooh. I'd love to change my fate.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We've got to find it before Hades.

TAG: Merida_010_f
I don't know. Maybe because they don't like their fate so far.

TAG: Merida_013_f
But since we're talking about Hades, it's probably just because he wants more power.

TAG: Merida_014_f
I've got some old bags in my House from before the Neverafter that might have a clue to the artifact. Would ya help me <Lore>search my House for a clue</Lore>?

TAG: Merida_011_f
Aye, everyone ought to be in command of their own fate.

TAG: Merida_012_f
I agree. Changing your fate CAN be a noble goal.

TAG: Merida_015_f
All right. I'll keep looking into it on my own. Let me know if you change your mind.
