Tiana, I need the recipe for a very specific Scottish dish: Salt-Baked Sea Wolf. Any chance you've got it?

TAG: Merida_001_f
No. I've never heard of it, but I do love a culinary mystery!

TAG: Merida_002_f
Give me a little time, and I'm sure I can find it in the Library.

Could you send it to {PlayerName} when you do?

TAG: Merida_004_f
Of course! ... It's not actually wolf, is it?

TAG: Merida_005_f
No! No. Just a fish with an odd name.
