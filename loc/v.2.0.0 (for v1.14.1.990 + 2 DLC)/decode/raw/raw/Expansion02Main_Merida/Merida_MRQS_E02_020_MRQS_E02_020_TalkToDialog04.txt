*SIGH* I know just what you're going to ask me.

TAG: Merida_001_f
You want to know if I got those fountains working again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Just wanted to see how you're doing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Should I not ask? I'm getting the feeling I shouldn't ask.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
... Did you get the fountains working again?

TAG: Merida_002_f
Oh. Well, I'm glad you asked that.

TAG: Merida_003_f
At the moment, I'm doing poorly because I still can't figure out what the problem is with these gammy fountains or how to turn them back on!

TAG: Merida_006_f
But I did find something rather interesting. There's a secret room hidden here, underneath the bridge.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Why didn't you open with that?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Can we deal with one thing at a time?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Secret rooms are way cooler than broken fountains.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Well, I'm telling you now!

TAG: Merida_010_f
Come on. Let's go explore it together. Just in case there's anything dangerous, we can watch each other's backs.

TAG: Merida_008_f
I've been trying to deal with the fountains so long I think I need a break from them.

TAG: Merida_009_f
I couldn't agree more!

TAG: Merida_004_f
You're right, you shouldn't have asked. But since you sort of asked anyway...

TAG: Merida_005_f
...NO! I haven't been able to get these gammy fountains workin' again because I can't figure out what's wrong with them in the first place!
