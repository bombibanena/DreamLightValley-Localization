{PlayerName}, what a wonderful party!

TAG: Merida_002_f
I'm so proud to have brought a wee bit of Scotland to the Vale!

TAG: Merida_003_f
I just wish the Lorekeeper had been able to attend...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you two good friends?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do enchanted books like parties?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm sure the Lorekeeper's just fine.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Oh, she's not just a friend, she's almost... another grandmother to me, here in the Vale. Since we all got stuck here, she's helped guide me.

TAG: Merida_008_f
I snuck away to check on her, and she seemed fine... But I feel rotten she couldn't be here.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
That's so thoughtful!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
You worry too much.

TAG: Merida_010_f
She said not to worry, but what if she was covering up her disappointment to make ME feel better?

TAG: Merida_012_f
Why don't I go <Lore>check on the Lorekeeper</Lore>? She'll probably be honest with me.

TAG: Merida_013_f
Would you? {PlayerName}, you're such a good friend!

TAG: Merida_011_f
Maybe so but... I still hope she's all right.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Everyone likes to be included, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merida_007_f
The Lorekeeper's been almost like another grandmother to me since we all got stuck in the Vale.

TAG: Merida_005_f
Maybe so, but...
