Did you see that?

TAG: Merida_006_f
That numpty couldn't even go two minutes without telling me what to do.

There has to be some way for you two to get along.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You two are hopeless!

TAG: Merida_007_f
If there was only a way you both could get out all this aggression towards one another.

Flynn's not going to learn his lesson unless I PROVE to him that I don't need his help.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Say... now there's an idea. When the clans REALLY can't resolve things, they have a sporting competition.

TAG: Merida_010_f
I was planning to hold a friendly archery contest to show some Villagers how to shoot.

TAG: Merida_011_f
But maybe you could convince Flynn to join, and we can make it not so friendly.

TAG: Player_001_f
An archery competition between you and Flynn?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a great idea.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't know about this.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
This sounds EXTREMELY dangerous.

TAG: Merida_012_f
Flynn will finally see who's the best archer here.

TAG: Merida_015_f
I already made some signs to post for the event. Think you could <Lore>put them up around the Vale for me</Lore>?

TAG: Merida_016_f
That braggart Flynn won't be able to resist a chance to show off.

TAG: Merida_000_f
I'll get on that. I guess you <Lore>could probably use some archery targets</Lore> too.

TAG: Merida_001_f
That'd be grand. If you need me, I'll be practicing for the competition.

TAG: Merida_013_f
What's the problem? I'll easily defeat Flynn, and he'll think twice before trying to "help" me again.

TAG: Merida_014_f
I promise. I'LL only be aiming for the targets.
