Flynn cheated, didn't he?

TAG: Merida_004_f
I knew it!

TAG: Merida_005_f
Congratulations. You're the winner by default!

TAG: Merida_006_f
Ugh! That means Flynn really won! Don't you see?

TAG: Merida_007_f
Now he can pretend he would have won if he weren't disqualified.

TAG: Merida_008_f
He did say something about pulling off a "Flynn Rider Trick Shot"...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It was obviously made up though.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It sounded pretty impressive.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Oh, made up, was it? What kind of shot was it?

TAG: Merida_013_f
Well, he said it involved tossing three apples into the air...

TAG: Merida_014_f
...then firing an arrow from behind his back, spearing the fruit on it, and curving the shot so it hits the bullseye.

TAG: Merida_009_f
HA! No way that braggart could pull off a shot like that.

TAG: Merida_010_f
I don't even think I could pull that off.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're Merida. You can pull off any shot.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Only one way to find out.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I imagine not, on account of it seeming physically impossible?

TAG: Merida_015_f
You know what? You're right. I at least have to try.

TAG: Merida_018_f
We'll just have to go get some apples.

TAG: Merida_019_f
Did I actually make it?

TAG: Merida_020_f
I did! Woo-hoo! I did it!

TAG: Merida_021_f
You have to go show Flynn! That ought to show him who does and doesn't need archery advice.

TAG: Merida_016_f
You're right. I at least have to try.

TAG: Merida_017_f
Hmm. It does seem impossible, doesn't it? But that's never stopped me before.

TAG: Merida_012_f
Impressive? Impressive how?
