Huh... the clue says that I left something with my "closest friend and ally in Dreamlight Valley."

TAG: Merida_002_f
Och, that dreich Forgetting! I don't remember who that could be.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Me, of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The Lorekeeper?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm guessing it's probably not Hades or Maleficent.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Well, you are quite nice. And I suppose I can't think of a better friend I've got here.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Did I leave something with you?

TAG: Merida_005_f
No, you didn't.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Then it must be someone else.

The clue also said my friend was <Lore>a fierce warrior who was good with a bo staff</Lore>. Could you ask around and see if anyone fits that description?

TAG: Merida_007_f
The Lorekeeper... I think of her more as a kindly old grandmother than a friend.

TAG: Merida_008_f
Och! There is no way it was either of them. That much I'm sure!

TAG: Merida_009_f
They both make my blood boil whenever they're around.
