{PlayerName}, this ink blocks the way to <Lore>the Wild Woods</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_001_f
It's a strange place, full of enchantment and shadows...

TAG: Merida_002_f
Are you going to unlock it with your <Lore>Story Magic</Lore>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, let's visit the Wild Woods. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyStoryMagic" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, not right now.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Good! I can't wait to explore there!

TAG: Merida_004_f
Oh no... Nothing happened? I suppose you need <Lore>more Story Magic</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_005_f
You're the only one who can reach these unreachable places, you know.

TAG: Merida_006_f
So please come back as soon as you can!

TAG: Merida_007_f
Really?

TAG: Merida_008_f
But we really should <Lore>clean up the Bind</Lore> before we get muddled up with Maleficent and Everafter.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Trust me.
