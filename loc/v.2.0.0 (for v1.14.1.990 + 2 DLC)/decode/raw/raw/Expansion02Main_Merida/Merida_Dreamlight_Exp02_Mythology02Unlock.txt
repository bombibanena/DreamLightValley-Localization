If we get rid of the ink here, we can reach <Lore>the Fiery Plains</Lore>!

TAG: Merida_001_f
I can't even imagine what incredible sights we'll see beyond the barrier!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's explore the Fiery Plains. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyStoryMagic" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll deal with this later.

TAG: Merida_002_f
Dee-dee-dee! The ink is melting away! We can go explore the Fiery Plains now.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Oh, I guess you need more <Lore>Story Magic</Lore> to get rid of this ink.

TAG: Merida_004_f
You know you're the only one who can take down these ink barriers.

TAG: Merida_005_f
So, let's come back here as soon as we can, all right?

TAG: Merida_006_f
Oh. I see.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Oh, but before we do, we really should <Lore>clean up the Bind</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_008_f
I'm not sure we're ready to take on Hades just yet.
