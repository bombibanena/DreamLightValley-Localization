Belle... I have a gift for you.

TAG: Beast_001_f
Oh! My book! I wondered where this went.

TAG: Beast_002_f
I was reading it before the Forgetting, but I couldn't find it anywhere.

TAG: Beast_003_f
It was in pieces, I'm afraid. I did my best to mend it.

TAG: Beast_004_f
Oh, you did a wonderful job!

TAG: Beast_005_f
Everything is in the right spot!

TAG: Beast_012_f
I wanted it to be the perfect gift for a perfect day.

TAG: Beast_006_f
Hmm... There's just one thing...

TAG: Beast_007_f
The part where the prince is revealed â it seems to be in the wrong spot.

TAG: Beast_008_f
UGH! I knew I'd make a foolish mistake. I wanted it to be perfect!

TAG: Beast_009_f
Oh, but it is!

TAG: Beast_010_f
That only makes it more perfect.
