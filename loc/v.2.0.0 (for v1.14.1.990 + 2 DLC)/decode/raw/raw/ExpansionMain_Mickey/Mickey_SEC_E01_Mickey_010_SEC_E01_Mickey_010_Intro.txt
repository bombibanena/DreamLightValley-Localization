Say, pal, I've been explorin' and I was wondering... could you help me do something special for Minnie?

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Sure! How can I help?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Welp, I've seen all kinds of incredible flowers around Eternity Isle, and I wanna give Minnie some that are just as special as she is.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
But a few of 'em are kinda hard to get to without magic. Like those <Lore>shiny blue ones</Lore> in the Dunes...

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Or the <Lore>nice orange ones</Lore> in Ancient's Landing...

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Oh, and I also saw some <Lore>big green ones</Lore> that were movin' around in the Wild Tangle!

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Yeah, those seem kind of... dangerous. Don't worry. I know just the flowers you're talking about.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
I'll see if I can find those for you. In the meantime... be careful if you go exploring the Isle!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Don't worry! I will!

TAG: Mickey_001_f
I just know we'll find her someday, and I want everything to be perfect for her when we do!
