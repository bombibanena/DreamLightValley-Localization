TAG: Mickey_001_f
A bunch of <Lore>little statues</Lore>...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
They're pieces from a board game we all used to play around the Valley!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ooh! How fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I hope the rules aren't too complicated...

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Yeah, it's a blast!

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Let me know if ya wanna try a game. And don't worry; you'll figure out the rules real quick.

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Gosh, I haven't played Scramblecoin in forever. I can't wait to teach it to ya!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
The game is called... <Lore>Scramblecoin</Lore>. And it was one of our favorite things to do with friends.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
So what do I need to play?

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Welp, I've got <Lore>five pieces</Lore> here for ya.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Now we can play.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Okay... So, Scramblecoin is all about movin' pieces around the board to try and collect coins. <Lore>The more games you win, the more pieces you get</Lore>!

TAG: Mickey_009_f
And all the pieces move around the board in different ways.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Hmm... what else? ... Oh! Everybody here loves Scramblecoin, so be sure to play with all your pals.

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Aw, it's real simple! Don't worry.
