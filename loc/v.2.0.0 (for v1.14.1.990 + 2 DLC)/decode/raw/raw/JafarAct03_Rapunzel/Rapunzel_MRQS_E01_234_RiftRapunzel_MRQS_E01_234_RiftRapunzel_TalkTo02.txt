Do you see it? It's so... odd.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Black and white can be wonderful for sketches. But when the whole Isle starts turning black and white...?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
It's like having a big white canvas and only one color of paint to use on it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think the rifts are kinda cool.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You really do think like a painter, don't you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Don't worry. We'll fix it. Together.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Oh, don't get me wrong â they're fascinating. I just don't want any more to open. What if people or animals start getting sucked into them?

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
That's what I'm hoping to stop. With the help of your imagination.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
I'm not sure I understand.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
You and I need to MAKE something together. Something using our creativity. And then toss it into the rift.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
The Spark's magic runs on imagination. So, if we can just do that... we can turn the power of the Spark back around and close the rift.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Oh... Okay! Got it!

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Only... now that you've asked me to think of something creative... all of a sudden, I can't think of anything!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Just grit your teeth and focus really hard...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Try thinking nonsense until something creative comes out!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What if I try to scare you?! Oh, wait. That's for the hiccups...

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Right. Okay... I'm focusing!

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Grr! Creativity! Imagination!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'M... IMAGINING... SO... HARD RIGHT NOW!!!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I don't think this is working.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Ugh! Nothing's happening.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Whoa. Wait. The second I stopped thinking about it so hard... I thought of something!

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
When Mother had me locked in my tower, once a year I would look out and see these lights in the distance.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
I'd love to build a <ActivityItem>Floating Lantern</ActivityItem> with you!

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
That sounds great! Why don't you start drawing up some designs while I find all the stuff we'll need?

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
That sounds perfect! I think we'll need some <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood, Bamboo, and Rope</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Nonsense... hmmm... nonsense like...

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Blep dangalang glibbidity flipporop floo?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Plop dingy razzmatazz!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
That's perfect! Now you're getting it!

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
Oh! That worked! I have an idea!

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
It's worth a try! Go ahead: Scare me.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
BOO!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Checking your work email while on vacation!!!

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
Oh, nice job on that "boo," {PlayerName}. But I was expecting it, so it didn't really scare me.

TAG: Rapunzel_023_f
Huh... that's funny. While I was waiting for you to scare me, my thoughts started flowing and I got an idea!

TAG: Rapunzel_024_f
What's an email?

TAG: Rapunzel_025_f
It's kind of like mail except... You know what, forget it. Maybe that's more scary for me than for you.

TAG: Rapunzel_026_f
I guess I do. That is a pretty painter-y way to think about it, isn't it?

TAG: Rapunzel_027_f
And that's exactly what we need to close this rift. Your creativity. Your imagination!

TAG: Rapunzel_028_f
I know we will. But... how?

TAG: Rapunzel_029_f
With your imagination, of course!
