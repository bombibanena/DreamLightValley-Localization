{PlayerName}! I'm so glad you're here! There's something I need to show you.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
I was exploring the Isle when this huge, jagged <Lore>rift</Lore> opened up right in front of me!

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
That's funny. I was just about to come ask you about that.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Those are Time Rifts, and I need YOUR help to close them!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
You need MY help? Well, I'd love to help in any way I can.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
But... wait... How exactly CAN I help you with this specific problem?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Use your imagination.

Trust me: You're perfect for this!

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Oh! Okay... I'm using it...

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Hmm... Maybe I could hit the rift with my frying pan? Or try and sew it up with my hair?

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Whoops. Not what I meant. I mean your imagination is the key to closing the rifts!

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Really? But how?

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
I think this will go faster if I SHOW you. Why don't you <Lore>lead me to that rift you saw opening</Lore>?

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Of course! Follow me!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Really? Perfect how?

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Your imagination! It's the key to closing the rifts!
