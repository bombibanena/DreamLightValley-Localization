Blue fur... BLUE FUR?

TAG: Daisy_001_f
This definitely narrows our suspect list!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It HAS to be Stitch.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm sure Vanellope is involved.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm totally lost. Help me out here.

TAG: Daisy_002_f
I think you're right! But I'm certain he wasn't working alone.

TAG: Daisy_017_f
According to Donald, Stitch is a master prankster. I think he's recruited Vanellope as his partner.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Just recently someone switched every one of Goofy's fishing lures for gummy worms.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Someone ALSO filled Remy's salt shakers with sugar.

TAG: Daisy_018_f
And I found blue fiber at every scene. I didn't realize it was fur. I was thinking "fluffy sweater."

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Sugar and blue fur! It's them.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
So Scrooge was innocent?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
What's the motive?

TAG: Daisy_000_f
I guess I'm just the latest victim in their prank spree.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
What do we do now?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
You must be furious.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I say we retaliate!

TAG: Daisy_009_f
They need to be stopped before they anger someone who would, let's say... turn them into algae.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
{PlayerName}, this calls for a sting! YOU convince them you want in on their next prank and arrange a meeting.

TAG: Daisy_023_f
I'll surprise them and give them a piece of my mind!

TAG: Player_000_f
Devious plan...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Don't you think it's a little mean?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not a good enough actor to do this...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I love it. Muwahaha!

TAG: Daisy_013_f
Believe me, it'd be meaner to wait for them to get in REAL trouble.

TAG: Daisy_016_f
I'll <Lore>talk to Stitch</Lore>. Convince him to meet me in the Cursed Cave with Vanellope.

TAG: Daisy_024_f
Perfect!

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Of course you are! Besides, it can't come from me â that would be WAY too suspicious.

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Hooray!

TAG: Daisy_021_f
Annoyed yes, but not furious. We solved a mystery â that's one of my favorite things to do! However...

TAG: Daisy_022_f
I think a lesson should certainly be learned.

TAG: Daisy_020_f
You're right. With your evidence, it's clearly Stitch and Vanellope.

TAG: Daisy_005_f
What if it's Vanellope AND Stitch?

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Blue fur is definitely a certain fluffy blue alien. But I didn't see Stitch at the gala, so I think he had help from a guest â Vanellope!
