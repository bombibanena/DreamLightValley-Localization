How's the happy couple? Was Anna swept off her feet?

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Not exactly. Anna's a little worried by the sudden appearance of all these flowers, and Kristoff thinks you went too far.

TAG: Daisy_002_f
And what do you think, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I agree with you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think both of you have a point.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I agree with Kristoff.

TAG: Daisy_003_f
This is why we get along so well. {PlayerName}, you and I have the same GRAND vision! We like to think big!

TAG: Daisy_006_f
I'm sure one day this will be a funny story we all laugh about.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Thanks for your help, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Daisy_004_f
That's one of the many things I like about you, {PlayerName}. You always try to see both sides of things.

TAG: Daisy_005_f
Oh, well! You can't please everyone, right? You just do your best with what you have.
