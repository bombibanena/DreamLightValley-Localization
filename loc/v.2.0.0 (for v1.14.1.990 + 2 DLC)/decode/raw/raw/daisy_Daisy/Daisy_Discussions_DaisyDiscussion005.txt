Minnie loves small, sweet gestures like when Mickey brings her a bouquet of wildflowers.

But I love grand gestures! I once had Donald's name written in fireworks for his birthday.

What do you think the most important part of a relationship is?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Having interests in common.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Trust.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Being willing to share french fries.

TAG: Daisy_004_f
You're right! That's a marvelous answer.

TAG: Daisy_005_f
If you and your sweetheart like the same things, you can do them together.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Not everything has to be similar, though. I want to learn new things, too. Donald taught me how to fish, and now we spend lovely afternoons fishing together.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
That's so important.

You can't have a good relationship without a solid foundation of trust.

TAG: Daisy_009_f
True. That's absolutely essential to any strong relationship!
