Let's see what we have...

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Hmmm, this is not a question for "Ask Daisy."

TAG: Daisy_005_f
What is it?

TAG: Daisy_006_f
A letter from Mother Gothel... challenging my competence to give advice to anyone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
CLASSIC Mother Gothel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you want to do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She might have a point...

TAG: Daisy_007_f
*sigh*

TAG: Daisy_008_f
Mother Gothel has always been difficult. The best thing to do is ignore her. She just wants a reaction.

TAG: Daisy_011_f
So you plan to do... nothing?

TAG: Daisy_012_f
I didn't say that. In my opinion, her constant pettiness comes from one thing...

TAG: Daisy_013_f
She needs to take the time to relax and appreciate life in the Valley. I imagine that could be difficult living in the Glade.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
I bet if we made the Glade a more enjoyable place, she'd be more at peace. Then, she wouldn't feel the need to nitpick so much.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm listening...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Let's give it a try!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I think she's a lost cause.

TAG: Daisy_016_f
Let's make her a nice place to get fresh air. We can add some <ActivityItem>Outdoor Seating</ActivityItem>, an <ActivityItem>Outdoor Table</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Decor</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Daisy_017_f
She might not want our help, but she's getting it anyway!

TAG: Daisy_018_f
Nobody's all lost. Sometimes they just need extra help from their neighbors.

TAG: Daisy_000_f
I know Kristoff wasn't exactly thrilled, but Vanellope got what she needed, in a roundabout way...

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Okay, maybe I got a little overzealous, but it was only because I was so excited to help them. There's nothing wrong with that.

TAG: Daisy_009_f
I suppose things have changed around here. Before the Forgetting, my column was so popular. No one ever complained...

TAG: Daisy_010_f
...aside from Mother Gothel, of course. But she was always difficult. The best thing to do is ignore her. She just wants a reaction.
