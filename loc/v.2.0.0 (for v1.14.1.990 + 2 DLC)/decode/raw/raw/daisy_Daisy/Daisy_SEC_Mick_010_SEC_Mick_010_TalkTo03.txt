This is amazing, {PlayerName}! I absolutely adore it. Did you have fun designing it?

Yes, a lot!

Why don't you take a look at the first theme I suggested and see what ideas spring to mind... Then <Lore>decorate the Challenge Area in the Boutique</Lore>!

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Then let's see if we can make that a definite yes!

Maybe you'll have more fun with something else we used to do in the Boutique.
