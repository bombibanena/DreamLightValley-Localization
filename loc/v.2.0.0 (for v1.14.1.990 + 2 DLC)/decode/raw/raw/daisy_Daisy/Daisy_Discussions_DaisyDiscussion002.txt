I was CRAZY busy today, and she made lunch for me as a surprise!

How long have you been friends?

Is she a good friend?

What did she make you?

Why, for as long as I can remember!

I'm so lucky we found each other.

I have a best friend like that.

Oh, but {PlayerName}, you do! Everyone in the Valley just adores you!

The best. She always listens whenever I need to talk, she's the first to celebrate my successes...

TAG: Daisy_007_f
...and she supports me in everything I do. Just like I do for her.
