What happened?! I heard a loud bang and the next thing â glitter! EVERYWHERE!

From the look of it, I'd say your gala has been glitter bombed.

Who would do such a thing? Who would dare?!

I've always wanted to be a detective!

I love a good whodunit.

Well, consider yourself on the case!

TAG: Daisy_011_f
Let's start by talking with our guests. I'll talk to Minnie and Donald. You go see Kristoff and Vanellope â then we'll share our intel.

I'll go do just that. And while I'm at it, I'll try and <Lore>wash away the glitter</Lore> somehow...

TAG: Daisy_007_f
You're right, {PlayerName}. And you're just that person!

TAG: Daisy_008_f
Well, I'm glad YOU can see a silver lining to this disaster. There's glitter in all the food, on the decorations, everywhere... It'll be impossible to clean!

We'll find the prankster responsible for this, Daisy.
