Oh, {PlayerName}, what am I going to do with Donald?

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Whenever he makes a mistake he gets SO mad at himself. I can't ever seem to talk sense into him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He does get upset really easily...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Help him learn?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He needs positive self talk.

TAG: Daisy_002_f
And that's where the problem always starts.

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Something goes wrong. Then he loses his temper and EVERYTHING goes wrong.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
At least he's a swell guy when he's not angry.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do you think he can change?

TAG: Daisy_004_f
He is. He's kind, charming, loving... He just needs to be those things to himself. You know what? I'm gonna go tell him that. Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Daisy_005_f
Oh, I don't want him to change. I just want him to calm down and be kinder to himself. Hmm... maybe we should try meditating together.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
I'm trying. And to give him credit, he's trying too.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
That's what you do when you care about someone, right? You help them help themselves!

TAG: Daisy_008_f
You're right!

TAG: Daisy_009_f
Maybe I should come up with some daily affirmations for him!
