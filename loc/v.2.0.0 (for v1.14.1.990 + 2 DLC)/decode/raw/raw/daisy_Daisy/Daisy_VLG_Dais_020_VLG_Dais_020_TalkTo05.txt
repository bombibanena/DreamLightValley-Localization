Super...

TAG: Daisy_010_f
Stunning!

TAG: Daisy_011_f
Spectacular!

{PlayerName}, this lookbook will absolutely convince Uncle Scrooge to add our clothes to his shop. It HAS to!

TAG: Daisy_002_f
Let's REALLY seal the deal by creating some demand in the Valley. It's time for you to sashay from model to influencer!

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Minnie and I are going to finish up the lookbook. Can you take these <ActivityItem>Business Cards</ActivityItem> and give them to a couple of Villagers?

TAG: Daisy_004_f
I'm thinking Ursula, Anna, and Remy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm on it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's a random group...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're really into this, huh?

TAG: Daisy_008_f
I'll talk to the Villagers and spread the word about Dots & Daisies.

TAG: Daisy_013_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. And make sure to wear our clothes to show them how stylish our line is!

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Well, they might not be the ones you'd expect to talk about fashion, BUT they are a five-star chef, the Queen of Arendelle, and probably the Valley's truest diva.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
If they start to ask about Dots & Daisies, Uncle Scrooge will know that he HAS to add us to his shop. Villagers will notice.

TAG: Daisy_012_f
That... actually kind of makes sense?

TAG: Daisy_009_f
I have a vision, and I know we can make it come true if we keep working together.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Well, I guess I'll follow your lead.
