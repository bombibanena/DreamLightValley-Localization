Let me guess... Vanellope's thrilled and feels like she could take on the world in her new dress!

TAG: Daisy_002_f
Not exactly...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It wasn't what she had in mind.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think she wants to spend time with you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She hates fancy dresses.

TAG: Daisy_000_f
She likes how she looks... I think she wanted to learn other things from you. Maybe more about reporting? And tying unbreakable knots?

TAG: Daisy_005_f
Huh... Well, why didn't she just say so?

TAG: Daisy_004_f
That's just kinda how Vanellope talks.

TAG: Daisy_009_f
Hmm... You know, maybe I'll ask Vanellope to be a Junior Reporter for the Dreamlight Gazette.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
And I'll see if I can find another use for that dress. Do you think it would fit on any of the critters in the Valley? I could even start a critter costume business!

TAG: Daisy_007_f
What a shame...

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Oh well... Ask Daisy, you get Daisy's answers. Villagers can't expect me to not be me.

TAG: Daisy_008_f
I think she wanted advice from you... Just more the reporting, confident, sporty parts of you. Less the fashionista side.
