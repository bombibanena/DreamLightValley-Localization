{PlayerName}, what did you find out from our party-guests-turned-suspects?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
About Vanellope...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
About Kristoff...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What did YOU find out?

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Vanellope was VERY bored for the whole party... And she tried to pin the glitter bomb on literally everyone else.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
VERY suspicious.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Glitter isn't her thing.

TAG: Daisy_016_f
Hmm... Vanellope COULD be our troublemaker, but I don't want to assume anything just yet.

TAG: Daisy_015_f
You're right. And I don't want to assume anything just yet.

TAG: Daisy_012_f
Kristoff just said a bunch of nice stuff about me?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
He's not the culprit.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Too MANY nice things... SUSPICIOUS.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
I agree. This isn't his style.

TAG: Daisy_017_f
I don't know about that, {PlayerName}. Kristoff isn't the glitter bomb type.

TAG: Daisy_018_f
Well, I know it wasn't Donald. He really wanted the party to go well for me.

TAG: Daisy_013_f
But as I was talking to Minnie, I had a thought. What if the guilty party was someone who DIDN'T attend the party?

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Like who?

TAG: Daisy_021_f
My first thought was Mother Gothel â because of her "Ask Daisy" letter. But the evidence points elsewhere...

TAG: Daisy_005_f
Scrooge McDuck.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
What's your evidence?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Seems kinda random.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Sabotaging another entrepreneur? The gall!

TAG: Daisy_007_f
The glitter bomb was in a box among the furniture I rented from him for the gala!

TAG: Daisy_022_f
He probably thought it would be a funny prank. Or, knowing him, he might've thought it would be an impressive addition to the party.

TAG: Player_000_f
Let me talk to him...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll make him confess.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll determine if he's innocent or not.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I still think Vanellope was more suspicious.

TAG: Daisy_008_f
Good luck, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Daisy_009_f
Oh, it's him, {PlayerName}. You'll see.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
We don't have ANY physical proof Vanellope was involved. We need to follow this Uncle Scrooge lead.

TAG: Daisy_020_f
My thoughts exactly!
