No matter what I do, this ice won't budge.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
Here, let me show you.

TAG: Elsa_025_f
...

TAG: Elsa_002_f
See?

TAG: Elsa_008_f
Nothing.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
I think it might be Dreamlight Magic. Do you know how to clear it away?

TAG: Player_003_f
Well, I do have a magic Pickaxe handy...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'm sure it'll work.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
It's the best tool for this.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Here goes nothing.

TAG: Elsa_027_f
Hmm. It didn't work...

TAG: Elsa_028_f
Do you think it would make a difference if your Pickaxe was stronger?

TAG: Player_001_f
Good idea. Guess I'm going to have to work some magic.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm so excited!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm so nervous.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Unless we can find some dynamite...

TAG: Elsa_004_f
I'm glad that you're happy to help me.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
Now this ice is very thick. If we were trying to melt it, it would take something as hot as the sun to do so.

TAG: Player_002_f
I've spent a lot of time around Merlin. I'm starting to understand how things work around here. You have to embrace the "dream" in "Dreamlight Magic."

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Hm. How would this work in a dream?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm thinking... I'm thinking...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
A flaming Pickaxe would be amazing...

TAG: Elsa_013_f
The sun's yellow. So let's start with some <ActivityItem>Sunflowers</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Lemons</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
We can get the warmth of the sun from Dazzle Beach with a <ActivityItem>Vial of Ocean Water</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Some <ActivityItem>Sugarcane</ActivityItem> to stick it all together.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
And maybe some <ActivityItem>Garlic</ActivityItem> for a little extra spice.

TAG: Elsa_016_f
You really have been spending a lot of time with Merlin.

TAG: Elsa_029_f
Although I don't know if even he would have thought of using <ActivityItem>Sugarcane</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Elsa_012_f
I'll be here when you've found everything. Then we can put the potion on your Pickaxe together.

TAG: Elsa_017_f

TAG: Elsa_020_f
I hope it works.

TAG: Elsa_030_f
Though I don't quite understand the <ActivityItem>Sugarcane</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Garlic</ActivityItem>, but at least we're not making something to eat.

TAG: Elsa_021_f
But I guess I'll have to go with symbolic flames. Like some <ActivityItem>Sunflowers</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Lemons</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_024_f
It sounds like you know what you're doing...

TAG: Elsa_031_f
Even if it does seem a little strange.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
It's good to be a little cautious when it comes to things like this.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
That's an explosive, right? It might collapse the Ice Cavern by accident. Your magic Pickaxe seems like a safer choice.
