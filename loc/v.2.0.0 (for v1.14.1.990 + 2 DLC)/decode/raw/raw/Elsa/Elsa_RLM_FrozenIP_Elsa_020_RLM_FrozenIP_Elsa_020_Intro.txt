And since you showed me the picture of that strange icy cave... I haven't been able to get it out of my head.

TAG: Elsa_025_f
I know I've been there before.

You should come visit...

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
...to see your sister.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
...to solve this mystery.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
...because we could sure use you.

That would be wonderful. It sounds like Anna loves your Village, so I know I will too.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Lead the way, {PlayerName}. Let's go see your Valley!

Well, after all the help you've given us, I'd be happy to do anything I can.
