Now to mix them together...

Now, in addition to the <ActivityItem>Dandelion Syrup</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Butter</ActivityItem>, we'll need a fish...

I remember we used to use a special fish â a <ActivityItem>Glittering Herring</ActivityItem> that only appeared <Lore>in the Glade of Trust on rainy days</Lore>. Do you think you could find one of those?

Oh, and here's the <ActivityItem>Dandelion Syrup</ActivityItem> we made together. I'll leave it with you for safekeeping.
