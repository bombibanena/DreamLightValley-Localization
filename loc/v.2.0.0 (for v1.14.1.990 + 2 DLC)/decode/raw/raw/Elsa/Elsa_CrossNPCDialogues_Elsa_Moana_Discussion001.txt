Hello, Moana. I've been hoping to talk to you. Is it true that you'll be the leader of your people one day?

TAG: Elsa_001_f
It is. I'm the daughter of the chief, which means someday I'll become chief.

How do you feel about that?

TAG: Elsa_003_f
It's a lot of responsibility. But I'm learning how to handle it.

I have to support my people, but I also have to be true to myself.

I know a little about what that's like. We should definitely talk more.
