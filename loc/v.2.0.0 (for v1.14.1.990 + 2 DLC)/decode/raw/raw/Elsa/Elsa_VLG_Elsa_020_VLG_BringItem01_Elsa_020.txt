Oh, I remember now...

You wanted to create a treasure hunt. We each hid something special from our past around the Village.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
And I suppose this is what I chose to hide.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Goodness, this <ActivityItem>Arendellian Pickled Herring</ActivityItem> must be very strong by now.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
Here. You should have a jar. After all, you helped me find the chest again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Thanks, I can't wait to taste mine.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I wonder if it's not too strong now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh, hello, food poisoning...

TAG: Elsa_006_f
I hope you enjoy it.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Oh, and before you go, I've been thinking about the new <ActivityItem>Purple Crest</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
It looks almost identical to the one we found before.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
I'm certain it will fit into another one of those holes in the wall of the Ice Cavern...

TAG: Elsa_007_f
It's possible. Perhaps just take a small bite to start.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
Oh, I don't think that will happen. The seal wasn't broken, and pickling is a preservation method.
