Oh, these are lovely. Now, for a little ice...

TAG: Elsa_005_f
There.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
What else do you think we'll need?

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Since we want to make it all about winter, let's add even more ice to the mix with <ActivityItem>Ice Chunks</ActivityItem> from the Ice Cavern...

TAG: Elsa_004_f
A <ActivityItem>Vial of Freezing Water</ActivityItem> from the Frosted Heights and some <ActivityItem>Snow</ActivityItem> to make it even chillier.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
I'll get everything and craft the <ActivityItem>Cold of Winter Potion</ActivityItem> myself.
