It's those bigger ice blocks...

TAG: Elsa_005_f
They feel... different, somehow. And the sound seems to be coming from one of them now.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
No matter what I do, I still hear it.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
Almost as if IT is the magic in this cave, and it's trying to protect something. It's keeping out anything it doesn't recognize...

TAG: Player_000_f
Maybe we need to try something different. We tried the warmth of summer. Now we'll try the cold of winter.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This is going to be awesome.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Any idea where to start?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No ice blocks will stand in our way.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
You do like a challenge, don't you? What do you have in mind?

TAG: Elsa_011_f
I'm thinking another potion.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
To start with, I'll find some flowers and you can use your powers to freeze them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Then my Pickaxe'll have the best of both worlds.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It'll be so pretty.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It'll put a little extra magic in my Pickaxe.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
That sounds like a very good idea, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Elsa_016_f
Well, hopefully it will be useful as well as pretty.

TAG: Elsa_017_f
I'd be glad to do that.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Perhaps with another potion?

TAG: Elsa_012_f
Good idea.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
Thank you for being so determined. What should we do?
