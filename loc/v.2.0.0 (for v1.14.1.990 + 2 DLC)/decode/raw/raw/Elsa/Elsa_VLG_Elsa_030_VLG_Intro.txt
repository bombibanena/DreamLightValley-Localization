{PlayerName}, something's happened in the Ice Cavern, and I need your help. Can you spare some time?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure, what's wrong?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not just now.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Well, I was exploring... trying to find out more about the sound...

TAG: Elsa_002_f
The one I hear coming from the <ActivityItem>Crests</ActivityItem> we found together...

But then, I touched the statue of Anna and ice started to grow from the ground. Ice I couldn't control.

TAG: Elsa_000_f
So I left before I got stuck inside. I think it's some sort of protection spell. To keep whatever's hidden in the cave safe.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Time to use my Pickaxe again.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You just touched the statue?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Well, it is an Ice Cavern...

TAG: Elsa_007_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. If you'll follow me, I'll show you.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
That's all. You'll see once we get there. Follow me.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
But this is different.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
If you'll come with me, you'll see.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
All right. Please let me know when you have the time.
