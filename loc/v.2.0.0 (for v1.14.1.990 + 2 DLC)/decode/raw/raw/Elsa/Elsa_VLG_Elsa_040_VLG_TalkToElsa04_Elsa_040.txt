Oh... I feel a bit light headed...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Must be your memories coming back!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I thought you were okay with the cold.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Yes... It's...

TAG: Elsa_006_f
We were so worried everything would be lost. Before I went back to the Enchanted Forest, I wanted to make sure that... something... was safe. I just can't remember what.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
But I remember that Anna insisted on helping us hide the <ActivityItem>Crests</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Elsa_010_f
It's just like her to want to help. I'm so lucky that she's my sister.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes, you are.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What were you trying to protect?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That doesn't help us find the last <ActivityItem>Crest</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
And now we're both lucky. I'm sure Anna can help us find the last <ActivityItem>Crest</ActivityItem>. Could you talk to her while I try to remember more?

TAG: Elsa_012_f
I don't know. Maybe Anna will remember. I'm sure she'll help us find the last <ActivityItem>Crest</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
Could you talk to her while I try to remember more?

TAG: Elsa_013_f
Well, I'm sure Anna will help us figure it out. Could you talk to her while I try to remember more?

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Yes, it's just that every time a memory comes back, I get a bit dizzy. But now I remember.

It's not the cold, {PlayerName}. It's my memories coming back to me...
