Hello, {PlayerName}. My sister tells me you helped her get through the forest safely and calm the other Spirits of Nature.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Don't mention it. Helping people's what I do!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Don't thank me yet. This isn't over.

TAG: Elsa_020_f
That's very kind of you. Do you think you could help me with one last thing?

TAG: Elsa_002_f
I've been trying to calm Gale, the Wind Spirit.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
It's usually very playful, but when the Water Spirit got upset, Gale was scared. I know Gale trusts me, but it's so agitated I'm not sure it can hear me clearly.

TAG: Player_003_f
I have an idea. We should put Wind Chimes in the trees, so this Spirit of Nature can...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
...create music.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
...have fun.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
...experiment with the sounds.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
I don't know if Gale understands what music is, but it's definitely worth a try.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
I'll keep trying to calm Gale while you make the chimes.

TAG: Elsa_017_f
I'll need <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> for the structure and tubes, some <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem> for the striker, and I'll need something to hold it together...

TAG: Elsa_022_f
Here. Take this <ActivityItem>Twine</ActivityItem> I found. Gale was tossing it around earlier. Maybe you can use that to assemble everything.

TAG: Elsa_023_f
Thanks. I'll be back with the <ActivityItem>Wind Chimes</ActivityItem> soon!

TAG: Elsa_014_f
Gale loves having fun. And playing pranks. You know, Wind Chimes just might do the trick.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
Gale does love new things. It came to see Olaf almost as soon as he entered the Enchanted Forest.

TAG: Elsa_021_f
You're right.
