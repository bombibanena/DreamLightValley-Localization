{PlayerName}, would you have a moment to talk about that Ice Cavern in the Forest of Valor?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm too busy right now.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
This is going to sound a little strange, but I've been hearing this sound... it's calling to me from the depths of the cave.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
It's not the first time that something like this has happened to me, and I've learned not to ignore such things.

TAG: Elsa_000_f
I'd investigate it myself, but there's some strange ice blocking the way that doesn't respond to my magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Let's go take a closer look.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
But isn't your power all about ice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Hey, do you think that cavern could be the mouth of a giant?

TAG: Elsa_001_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. Come with me; I'll show you.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
That's what makes it so strange.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
I'm sure you'll see what I mean once I show you. Please, follow me.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
No. Trust me, if there were giants around, you'd know.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
I understand. I know what it's like to be responsible for a kingdom. Please let me know when you have some time.
