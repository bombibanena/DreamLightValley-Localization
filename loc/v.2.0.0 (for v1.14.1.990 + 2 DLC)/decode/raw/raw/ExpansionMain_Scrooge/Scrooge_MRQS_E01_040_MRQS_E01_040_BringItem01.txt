Aye? What's this? Are ya bringin' me rubbish now, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_001_f
You're not gonna believe this. I found ANOTHER one of your shops on Eternity Isle. It had this sign on it...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It could be a great opportunity.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's in need of some repair.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
But I'm not sure even you could save this business...

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Glad to hear you're thinking in terms of new ventures, {PlayerName}. But this one isn't exactly new...

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
I'm afraid even the best-laid business plans aren't always a roaring success.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
That shop was one of my few failures.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
How so?

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Well, there's a lot to consider when opening a business. Timing bein' one of the most important!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
I decided to open this shop too early... AND too late. Not long after Eternity Isle was discovered, when Villagers first started to settle there...

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
...folks were more interested in gawking at the scenery than shopping. Then the Forgetting started to happen.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
So, I decided to cut my losses. But now maybe...

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Och! Let's go see the shop on Eternity Isle. I'll decide what to do there.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Oh no! Not that money pit again!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Aye, I certainly couldn't do it then...
