{PlayerName}! These gems are magnificent!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
What brings you to see me with such a wonderful gift?

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I have an opportunity for you!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
An opportunity? Aye, you know me well. I'm always interested in a new opportunity.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
So I've been hanging out with Gaston...

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Gaston?! Ugh. I thought we were rid of that blowhard. Does he still have more muscles than brains?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's... a way to describe him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's grown... somewhat during his time in the desert.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yes.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Aye, I thought so.

TAG: Scrooge_020_f
A cut of the profits! 50% seems fair.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Done!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How about 25%?

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
What does Gaston want?

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
We're trying to fix up his lodge.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
I managed to restore some of it, but the interior is pretty bare. Think you could help out?

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
Well, since you've brought me such a valuable gift, I suppose I could help supply ya.

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
I think I have some furnishings in storage somewhere that would be appropriate for Gaston's... unique tastes.

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
Great!

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
Now, those gems will get ya quite a bit, but the rest won't come free. After all, I've a business to run!

TAG: Scrooge_019_f
What would you want for them?

TAG: Scrooge_021_f
Pleasure doing business with you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Scrooge_024_f
Great!

TAG: Scrooge_025_f
But if you're trying to restore the same lodge that I remember...

TAG: Scrooge_026_f
You might need more than furniture to return it to its former condition.

TAG: Scrooge_027_f
It's true. The exterior is still falling apart.

TAG: Scrooge_028_f
Never fear! You should be able to gather the resources you'll need for the renovations.

TAG: Scrooge_029_f
The Island should have the <ActivityItem>Oasis Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem> to get the lodge fixed up.

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
And here you are: <ActivityItem>Gaston's Antler Chair</ActivityItem> and a <ActivityItem>Crate of Furniture<ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_022_f
You drive a hard bargain...

TAG: Scrooge_023_f
But I can accept those terms!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Well, isn't that a surprise!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Aye, well, at least he came to no harm out there.
