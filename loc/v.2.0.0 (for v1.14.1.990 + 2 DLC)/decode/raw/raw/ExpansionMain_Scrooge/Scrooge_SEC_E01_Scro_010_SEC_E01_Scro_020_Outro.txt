{PlayerName}, you've done it! You rebuilt an <ActivityItem>Ancient Machine</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Eternity Isle will be runnin' itself before long!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
And I'll make all the profit!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm just glad this will help everyone on the Isle.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Oh, but surely you'll toss a wee percentage my way as a finder's fee?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Of course.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No chance.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe...

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Ah, {PlayerName}, I knew ya wouldn't forget your genius business adviser.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
And I haven't forgotten you either. Here's somethin' for your troubles.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
While I was adventuring around the Isle, I found something that ya might find useful for makin' more of those Machines!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
It's been a pleasure consultin' with ya. Eternity Isle is already just about takin' care of herself!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Fine. But my advice won't always be free, ya know.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Still... here: I'll toss a little somethin' your way for your trouble.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Ah, {PlayerName}, you're always thinkin' of everyone else. It warms my heart.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
But you deserve some consideration, too. Here. A little somethin' for yourself.
