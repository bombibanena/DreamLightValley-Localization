{PlayerName}! I made another discovery! You got time for another tip about automatin' the Island?

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
Let's hear it.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
You must remember how I was tellin' ya this Isle used to be home to all sorts of <Lore>Ancient Machines</Lore> that helped care for it!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
I managed to learn more about one!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
It's some sort of <Lore>Machine that gardens for ya</Lore>!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
WHAT?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
NO WAY.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Way ahead of you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
What's the catch?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Aye, it's quite remarkable!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Reminds me of the sorts of things my dear friend Gyro builds.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
There's just one wee problem.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I don't know where you're goin' to find all the <ActivityItem>ancient parts</ActivityItem> to build it!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Ancient parts... that's the sort of thing I'm always finding with my <Lore>Hourglass</Lore>!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Well then, why don't ya take these <ActivityItem>Ancient Blueprints</ActivityItem> and see what you can do with 'em!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
It looks like I should have no problem <Lore>finding all of this stuff and building an Ancient Gardener</Lore>! I'll get to work!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Aye, and if it's not gardenin' you're interested in, ya can always make another kind of <ActivityItem>Ancient Machine</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
The potential here is grand! I cannae wait to see what ya do.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
I might need to <Lore>make my Hourglass more powerful at a Timebending Table</Lore> before I can find all of this...

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
It seems like there are lots of cool things I can <Lore>build using stuff I find with my Hourglass</Lore>!

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
Aye, there is one...
