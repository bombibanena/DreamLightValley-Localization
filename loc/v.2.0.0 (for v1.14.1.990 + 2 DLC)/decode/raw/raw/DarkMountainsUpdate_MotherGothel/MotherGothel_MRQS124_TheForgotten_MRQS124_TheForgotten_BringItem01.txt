The Orb! Darling, you've done it! And not to worry; I'll dispose of it, safely. Mustn't let it fall into the wrong hands.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Now see? Doesn't everything feel better without that pesky Pillar getting in the way?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I guess you're right.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Everything feels the same.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Something feels... wrong.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Of course I am, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
I can't wait to show you how much grander life can be when you aren't forced to live under Merlin's rules.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
But first... you'll have to do me one itsy-bitsy favor.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What is it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Oh great. ANOTHER favor.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Oh, I do love how obliging you are, {PlayerName}. You really should show this side of yourself more often.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Now to the task at hand... I'm devastated that I've lost one of my most prized possessions. A <ActivityItem>Jewel-Encrusted Mirror</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
I was admiring myself when I simply... dropped it in the water somewhere around here. How clumsy of me!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'll get it. Don't worry.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Something here isn't adding up...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Why don't you get a new mirror?

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
And that's why I love you, dear! You do things without asking bothersome questions!

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Finding my <ActivityItem>Jewel-Encrusted Mirror</ActivityItem> will be no trouble for you. Simply <Lore>use that Fishing Rod of yours in the waters of this area</Lore>.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
I'll be waiting for you near the Giant Willow, not doing anything suspicious. Ha! I'm just teasing, darling! See you soon!

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Don't you trust me, {PlayerName}? After all I've done for you?

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Of course I do, it's justâ

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
Perfect! Then you'll have no more questions or objections!

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Oh, I have other mirrors, dear. But this one has sentimental value. I'd be devastated to lose it.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Manners, {PlayerName}. Just because you're growing up doesn't mean you can leave THOSE behind.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Don't be ridiculous. The air is just brimming with possibility!

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Wrong? Oh, don't be a fool. You've gotten far too used to the way things were. You'll understand soon enough.
