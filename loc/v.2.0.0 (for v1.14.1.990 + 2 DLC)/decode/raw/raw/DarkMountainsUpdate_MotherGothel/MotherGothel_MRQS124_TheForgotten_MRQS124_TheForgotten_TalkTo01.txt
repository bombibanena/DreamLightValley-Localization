Just who I was hoping to see! Darling, tell me you've noticed all those ugly Night Thorns sprouting around the Valley. And how some of the Villagers are starting to lose their memories...?

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Merlin hasn't the faintest clue what might be causing it.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
But don't worry. I won't tell him it's ALL your fault.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
MY fault?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I didn't do this!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I knew it...

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Well, of course it is.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
This Village clearly reflects you. Your dreams. Your desires. Your fears.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
And we've all noticed that you haven't been yourself lately.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
What? No. I'm... I'm fine.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I don't know what's happening to me...

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Ugh. I thought I was hiding it so well.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
Tsk, tsk, tsk... You mustn't lie to Mother Gothel. You know how I hate that.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
But don't worry. There's nothing wrong with you. You're simply growing up!

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
You're finally seeing the world for the cruel and dangerous place it is.

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
Maybe you're right.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
But the world's NOT cruel and dangerous.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
I always am.

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
Now, trust me. After all, we must look out for ourselves.

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
In fact... <Lore>Follow me</Lore>. You have much to learn.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
Ugh. You're starting to sound like a certain long-haired blond person...

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Isn't it obvious?

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
Oh, you aren't nearly as clever as you think you are. It really is annoying.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Oh, please. Of course you did!

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Finally! I don't know why it's taken you so long to admit it to yourself.
