{PlayerName}, those rifts are starting to cause more problems. I'm doing everything I can, but I need your help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
On it. What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No time. But I'll talk to you soon.

TAG: Nala_006_f
There are a lot more of those odd fish appearing in all the waters of the Valley.

TAG: Nala_008_f
It's getting so we can't catch anything else.

TAG: Nala_009_f
But if anyone tries to cook them, they just disappear. We can't let the pride go hungry.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Don't worry. I'll catch some fish for them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I just hope I can catch something else too.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
*sigh* Guess I've gotta save the day once again.

TAG: Nala_012_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. I don't want anyone to panic.

TAG: Nala_010_f
If we <Lore>get fish for Moana, Remy, and Donald</Lore>, that will help everyone.

TAG: Nala_000_f
Moana's been trying to catch a <ActivityItem>Swordfish</ActivityItem>. But she hasn't had any luck unless she goes far out into the water.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Remy wants <ActivityItem>Crab</ActivityItem> for a meal he's making.

TAG: Nala_002_f
And Donald really wants some <ActivityItem>Tuna</ActivityItem>. I think he's gone past frustrated into full-on temper tantrum.

TAG: Nala_013_f
So do I. Let's hope that Fishing Rod thing of yours does the trick.

TAG: Nala_014_f
That is kind of your job. You should be used to it by now.

TAG: Nala_007_f
All right. I'll do what I can, but please hurry.
