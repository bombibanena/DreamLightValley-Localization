{PlayerName}, I'm hoping you can help me. Simba's still a bit uncertain in his role as king. How can I encourage him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Compliment him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Listen to him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sabotage his enemies.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Okay... I already know what a good and responsible king he is.

TAG: Nala_004_f
I just wish he could see himself like I do. Until he does, I guess I'll just have to keep telling him.

TAG: Nala_002_f
I guess that makes sense. When I got upset as a cub, my mom would listen to me...

TAG: Nala_005_f
And even if she couldn't do anything, just being heard made me feel better.

Unless you're talking about Scar, he doesn't really have enemies.
