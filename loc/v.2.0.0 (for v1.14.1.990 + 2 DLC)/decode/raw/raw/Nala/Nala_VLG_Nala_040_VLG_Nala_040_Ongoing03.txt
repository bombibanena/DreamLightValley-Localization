Didn't Ursula say to place each <ActivityItem>Lioness Statue</ActivityItem> in front of the right rift?

TAG: Nala_001_f
That means the <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> each need to have the same gemstone that I found near each rift.

TAG: Nala_006_f
I'll place the <ActivityItem>Aquamarine Lioness Statue</ActivityItem> near the rift on Dazzle Beach...

TAG: Nala_007_f
And the <ActivityItem>Amethyst Lioness Statue</ActivityItem> in the Frosted Heights.

TAG: Nala_008_f
And the <ActivityItem>Citrine Lioness Statue</ActivityItem> goes near the rift in the Glade of Trust!

Where did I find <ActivityItem>Aquamarine, Citrine, and Amethyst</ActivityItem>...?
