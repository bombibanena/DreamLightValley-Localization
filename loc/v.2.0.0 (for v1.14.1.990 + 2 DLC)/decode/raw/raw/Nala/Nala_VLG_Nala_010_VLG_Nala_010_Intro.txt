{PlayerName}, I've been scouting the Valley, and it seems to have many of the things we have at home.

TAG: Nala_012_f
Lots of water holes, gathering spots, and caves...

TAG: Nala_013_f
...and a few things I don't understand very well.

TAG: Nala_007_f
But there's one thing missing that would make it better for lions. Do you think you could help me change that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes! Let's make Dreamlight Valley more lion friendly.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I can't. I'm busy right now.

TAG: Nala_008_f
Thank you! So, in the Pride Lands, I'm in charge of finding food and keeping the pride safe and fed.

TAG: Nala_009_f
I'd like to do that for this place too.

TAG: Nala_011_f
But there isn't a good hunting ground.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll make one so you feel more at home.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
A hunting ground? What do we need for that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
But there's nothing around here to hunt...

TAG: Nala_010_f
That would be great! This is going to help everyone.

TAG: Nala_000_f
We'll need to find a stretch of flat land, somewhere without much to get in the way.

TAG: Nala_001_f
I guess Dazzle Beach would be the closest thing we have.

TAG: Nala_002_f
All right. We'll want to create some cover for us to crouch behind and carve some trails to help bring prey out of hiding.

TAG: Nala_003_f
Oh, and there's one more thing that makes a territory good for lions.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
A giant scratching post?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
A lion-sized kibble dispenser?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Industrial strength catnip?

TAG: Nala_004_f
You mean like a tree? Not exactly.

TAG: Nala_005_f
We need a spot where we can rest at the end of a long day.

TAG: Nala_014_f
A large, flat rock would be best.

TAG: Nala_017_f
Maybe I've got something like that... but if not, Scrooge's Store should. I'll check.

TAG: Nala_018_f
While you do that, I'll keep scouting for danger.

TAG: Nala_039_f
I'll come talk to you once I've made Dazzle Beach lion friendly!

TAG: Nala_020_f
Kibble...? What's that?

TAG: Nala_021_f
Forget it. It was just a joke. What do we need?

TAG: Nala_022_f
I have no idea what that is.

TAG: Nala_015_f
Just a few things. With everything you've done around here already, it shouldn't be too tough.

TAG: Nala_019_f
There must be something. Antelope, zebra, gazelle... they try to blend into the landscape.

TAG: Nala_016_f
But if we make a hunting ground, the grasses should lure them out.

TAG: Nala_031_f
I understand. I'll keep looking around the Valley and try to find a way to make myself useful.
