{PlayerName}... just who I was looking for!

TAG: Nala_009_f
When Simba and I were cubs, we used to wrestle all the time. It's great exercise and training, and pretty fun too.

TAG: Nala_011_f
But since I always beat him, Simba refuses to practice with me anymore. Would you help me practice?

TAG: Player_000_f
I don't think that's a good idea, Nala.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I don't have claws.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm much smaller than you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm terrible at fighting.

TAG: Nala_001_f
I'd never use my claws in wrestling.

TAG: Nala_004_f
It's just practice. I don't want to actually hurt anyone.

TAG: Nala_006_f
*sigh* I guess you're right. It's probably a bad idea.

TAG: Nala_010_f
If you think of any way I can practice, please let me know.

TAG: Nala_002_f
That's true. It wouldn't be very fair.

TAG: Nala_005_f
Wait â you're fully grown, right? You're not going to get any bigger?

TAG: Nala_007_f
Not as big as a lion. Sorry.

TAG: Nala_003_f
Oh. I suppose that's not surprising.

TAG: Nala_008_f
Your species does seem a little... squishy.
