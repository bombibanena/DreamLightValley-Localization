I looked over the Beach. You've done a wonderful job, {PlayerName}. Now there are plenty of trails and pouncing spots for us.

TAG: Nala_000_f
And your coverings should work well.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Perfect as always...

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
It should be good enough for our expedition.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
These "whiskers" make me feel ridiculous.

TAG: Nala_001_f
I don't know enough about how you change your appearance to say. But you look ready for our expedition.

TAG: Nala_007_f
We just need to lie in wait. Let me teach you how to pounce.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm already an expert pouncer.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I could use all the pouncing tips I can get.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'd rather just get my food from the grocery store.

TAG: Nala_008_f
Really? Well, then we'll just have to wait for an antelope or a zebra to come along.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Then we can see who's the better pouncer.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Just follow my lead and stay quiet.

TAG: Nala_015_f
I wonder why this isn't working. You do have prey here, don't you?

TAG: Nala_016_f
Antelope? Zebras? Gazelles?

TAG: Nala_017_f
Maybe a wildebeest?

TAG: Nala_018_f
We just don't have many animals like that in the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Most animals around here are my friends.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We've got lots of fruits and vegetables.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I could bake you a cake instead?

TAG: Nala_019_f
Oh... Well, I guess we make friends with prey sometimes, too. Like Simba did with Timon and Pumbaa.

TAG: Nala_023_f
That does leave us with a problem, though. What will I eat?

TAG: Nala_022_f
Oh! I know! You could eat fish! We've got lots of fish.

TAG: Nala_024_f
I'm not too good at fishing. I don't do very well with water.

TAG: Nala_025_f
Don't worry, Nala. Just watch, and I'll show you how I fish.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm great at it, so you'll learn.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm okay at it, so we'll practice together.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Fair warning. I'm TERRIBLE at it.

TAG: Nala_026_f
Lead the way. Hope you're as good as you say you are.

TAG: Nala_029_f
I'll try to <Lore>catch some fish</Lore> to show you how.

TAG: Nala_004_f
And maybe I'll even <Lore>catch a few Rare or Unique Fish</Lore> so you can see it's not so tough.

TAG: Nala_027_f
That sounds good. I helped you learn to pounce. Now you can help me learn to fish.

TAG: Nala_028_f
I'm sure you're not that bad. But let's find out.

TAG: Nala_020_f
Is that all? Lions need much more than that.

TAG: Nala_021_f
That doesn't exactly sound like food for a lion.

TAG: Nala_009_f
It's fairly simple. You lie down flat then leap forward when something comes along.

TAG: Nala_012_f
Is that some kind of water hole?

TAG: Nala_013_f
Kind of. But I guess we don't have one of those in the Valley. Just Goofy's Stall.

TAG: Nala_014_f
You can't always rely on that for food. Someone around here needs to hunt.

TAG: Nala_002_f
It looks right. Okay, we're ready to start.

TAG: Nala_003_f
They look fine to me. Or at least good enough for us to get started.
