More <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem>? Did you find these in the Frosted Heights and the Glade?

TAG: Nala_004_f
That's right. They were all buried in the ground, just like the first one. But that's not all.

TAG: Nala_005_f
More of these weird rifts have opened up in other parts of the Village.

TAG: Nala_006_f
Oh no. Do you think whatever's happening...

TAG: Nala_007_f
...is my fault? I was the one who damaged that first statue.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course not. You didn't know this would happen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's okay. We'll solve this together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you kidding?! If anything, it's my fault.

TAG: Nala_008_f
I suppose you're right.

TAG: Nala_014_f
Let's start with these rifts. Did anything dangerous come out of the one on Dazzle Beach while you were watching?

TAG: Nala_015_f
I didn't see anything come out of it. But something did happen.

TAG: Nala_016_f
Goofy came by to fish. He cast out his rod near the rift and snagged something...

TAG: Nala_017_f
Then he shouted and ran off.

TAG: Nala_018_f
Oh boy. Sounds like I better <Lore>go talk to Goofy</Lore> to find out what he saw.

TAG: Nala_009_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I know we can get to the bottom of this.

TAG: Nala_010_f
You might have found the statue, but I'm the one who dug it up.

TAG: Nala_011_f
That's when the rift opened.

TAG: Nala_012_f
I'm sure it's no one's fault. We didn't know what would happen.

TAG: Nala_013_f
But if we caused this problem together, then that's how we'll solve it. Together.
