Oh, hello, {PlayerName}. Can I help you with something?

TAG: Nala_006_f
I just wanted to let you know that Simba felt really bad about what happened. We went and scouted for some food around the Village.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Thank you for letting me know. I was worried when he just forgot like that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He's trying his best.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I won't pick a side.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He just got a little too much into worrying about people worrying.

TAG: Nala_002_f
I know he is. And I know it's not easy being a leader.

TAG: Nala_007_f
There's so much for Simba to think about.

TAG: Nala_008_f
I'm glad you could help him. And I'm hoping we can figure out the role he used to play in the Valley.

TAG: Nala_009_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}... for everything.

TAG: Nala_003_f
You don't need to. We all just want what's best for the Valley.

TAG: Nala_004_f
I guess so. And I know it's not easy being a leader.
