I can't believe that worked.

TAG: Nala_002_f
The thorns are too dense for the hyenas to get through. We did it!

TAG: Nala_000_f
Whoa. You just held off a whole pack of hyenas all on your own!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Can I start a Nala fan club?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Now it's time to find Simba.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
They must be pretty pathetic hyenas.

TAG: Nala_021_f
Thanks. But I couldn't have done it without you.

TAG: Nala_024_f
Now, it's my turn to help you.

TAG: Nala_008_f
You should stick close to me for a bit.

TAG: Nala_007_f
Even without the hyenas, the jungle has its dangers.

TAG: Nala_009_f
I don't know where you fall on the food chain, but your teeth and claws aren't very sharp, and you look kind of... squishy.

TAG: Nala_010_f
You've hardly got any fur. Is that normal for your species?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yep. I'm a human.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Uh... let's not worry about that for now.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm a really big, hairless meerkat.

TAG: Nala_011_f
A "human"... huh? I've never seen any of you around the water hole. Well... welcome. And like I said, stick close to me.

TAG: Nala_012_f
A lot of things in this jungle might want to turn you into a meal.

TAG: Nala_018_f
Good to know. I'll watch out.

TAG: Nala_019_f
Looks like we're not going anywhere fast. There's a huge dried stump blocking our way into the jungle.

TAG: Nala_020_f
Don't worry. Maybe <Lore>another one of my Royal Tools can remove that</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_013_f
Okay.

TAG: Nala_014_f
But there are lots of creatures in this jungle that might want to turn you into a meal.

TAG: Nala_015_f
So stick close.

TAG: Nala_016_f
Really? Like Timon? Wow. I didn't know meerkats could grow so big. Well, just stick close to me.

TAG: Nala_017_f
A lot of things in this jungle would probably love to turn a giant hairless meerkat into a meal.

TAG: Nala_022_f
Right. We'll have to head deeper into the jungle.

TAG: Nala_023_f
Just one of them isn't so tough. But when they come at you in big numbers... you have to watch out.

TAG: Nala_025_f
And speaking of watching out for things...
