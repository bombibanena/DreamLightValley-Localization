I remember now! A long time ago, the Here and There started to leak into the Valley.

TAG: Nala_008_f
We worked with Merlin to do something involving those statues.

TAG: Nala_009_f
But I still can't remember why they look like me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're the protector of the Village. It just makes sense.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not sure either. I guess we could ask Merlin.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Well, they had to look like something.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Me? The protector? You really think of me like that...? Wow.

TAG: Nala_020_f
Maybe we could <Lore>borrow something from Minnie</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_021_f
Great idea. I'll check with her.

TAG: Nala_002_f
I feel like there was something else we had to do... some kind of fourth ingredient...

TAG: Nala_004_f
I wish I could remember.

TAG: Nala_005_f
Don't worry, Nala. I'll gather everything we need. Maybe it'll come back to us.

TAG: Nala_000_f
I appreciate it... I do. But the important thing is that we fix this problem.

TAG: Nala_013_f
In the Memory, I think I saw how it all worked. It was an enchantment.

TAG: Nala_014_f
Each <ActivityItem>Lioness Statue</ActivityItem> has an <ActivityItem>Enchanted Heart</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Nala_015_f
We needed something magical from here... something from there... and something that's spent time in both places.

TAG: Nala_017_f
For something magical from here, I think we used <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> before.

TAG: Nala_016_f
And the fish are from the other side. We could <Lore>catch those fish near the rifts</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_018_f
If we </Lore>catch three fish</Lore>, that should do it. But what could we get to complete the spell? Something that's been in both places...?

TAG: Nala_019_f
Didn't you say Minnie had been to the Here and There?

TAG: Nala_011_f
I don't think it really matters. What matters right now is that we fix this problem.

TAG: Nala_012_f
I guess you're right. If it had been Donald who'd noticed the rifts, maybe they'd all look like Donald.

TAG: Nala_001_f
But I guess it doesn't matter. We just need to figure out how to fix this.
