{PlayerName}, I've seen lots of Villagers like you who are covered in skin. Is that common? Most animals where I come from are covered in fur or hair.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We have clothes instead.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We do have some hair.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't need it. I'm not cold.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Clothes? Those must be the coverings you drape yourselves in. Are they for protection?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Kind of.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Yes. Also, clothing is pretty.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Yes. Also, clothing has pockets.

TAG: Nala_002_f
Well, they certainly are colorful. Like a bunch of different birds.

TAG: Nala_004_f
Well, it is very colorful. Not very good camouflage, though.

TAG: Nala_003_f
Are those the little places you put things? And carry them without your mouth?

TAG: Nala_005_f
That does sound useful.

TAG: Nala_006_f
I've noticed that. But it's not a lot. It can get very cold and wet in the rainy season.

TAG: Nala_007_f
I hope you're okay with so little.

TAG: Nala_008_f
Not now, maybe, but what about in the rainy season? It can get very cold and wet.
