It's done! I've got the perfect territory set up for you on Dazzle Beach.

TAG: Nala_031_f
Thank you! I really appreciate it. And now I can teach you to pounce, just like Simba and I learned to do as cubs.

TAG: Nala_009_f
But before we start... you're not really dressed for pouncing lessons.

TAG: Nala_019_f
You need to be protected from the heat of the sun and ready to hide in the underbrush.

TAG: Nala_020_f
Since you don't have fur like I do, maybe you could find some of those coverings you wear on your body.

TAG: Nala_021_f
Great. I'll <Lore>put on some more Rustic clothes.</Lore>

TAG: Nala_022_f
Oh, and whiskers! You'll need some sort of whiskers.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Humans don't really have those...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll see what I can do.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
We humans call our whiskers "mustaches."

TAG: Nala_023_f
But you must have something like them. How else do you navigate and detect what's around you?

TAG: Nala_024_f
Okay. I'll make sure I'm <Lore>wearing whiskers</Lore> for this.

TAG: Nala_025_f
Let's meet on Dazzle Beach when you're ready for your first pouncing lesson.

TAG: Nala_026_f
I use mine to help me navigate and detect what's around me. So you'll have to find something like that.

TAG: Nala_027_f
And you use these "mustaches" to navigate and detect what's around you?

TAG: Nala_028_f
Sort of...

TAG: Nala_029_f
Good.
