What's this?

TAG: Nala_006_f
It's a <ActivityItem>Sound System</ActivityItem>. I'll get the speakers set up.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Just think of it as a really big noisemaker.

TAG: Nala_007_f
If you and Simba roar into the microphone as loud as you can, the noise will fill the whole jungle.

TAG: Nala_008_f
The hyenas will think we've got an army of lions on our side. That should scare them away.

TAG: Nala_009_f
I guess it's worth a try.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Say, can humans roar?

TAG: Nala_011_f
If you roared with us, it would make it even louder.

TAG: Nala_012_f
I guess I could try.

TAG: Nala_013_f
Go on. Let me hear your roar.

TAG: Nala_042_f
And not like that pitiful one you did when we first met. Really go for it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
ROAR!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
GRRR! RARRR!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Uh... grr? Roar...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Meow.

TAG: Nala_014_f
Not too bad, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Nala_024_f
And you've definitely made me curious about this place you come from.

TAG: Nala_025_f
Why don't you come find out? It's called Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The Villagers there are like my pride.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
There's lots there for you to explore.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Everything the light touches there is mine.

TAG: Nala_015_f
Maybe you've got a little lion in you after all.

TAG: Nala_020_f
I'll get the <ActivityItem>Sound System</ActivityItem> set up. It's now or never!

TAG: Nala_022_f
I can't believe that actually worked!

TAG: Nala_021_f
The hyenas cleared out as soon as they heard the sound of the roaring.

TAG: Nala_023_f
I'm impressed, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Nala_026_f
Well, after how much you've helped us, I'd love to meet your pride.

TAG: Nala_037_f
Why don't you come visit and find out?

TAG: Nala_038_f
Is there a place there for lions to sleep?

TAG: Nala_039_f
Good point. I'll <Lore>get one set up for you</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_002_f
Then Simba and I will come visit as soon as it's ready.

TAG: Nala_029_f
Though I do have one question...

TAG: Nala_030_f
Do you have any food besides grubs?

TAG: Nala_031_f
We've got lots of food.

TAG: Nala_032_f
Zebra?

TAG: Nala_033_f
'Fraid not.

TAG: Nala_034_f
Antelope?

TAG: Nala_035_f
Sorry, none of that either.

TAG: Nala_036_f
Hippo? What DO you have?

TAG: Nala_027_f
I'd love to see some new places.

TAG: Nala_028_f
So it's sort of like your Pride Lands? I'd love to see it.

TAG: Nala_016_f
Is that the best you've got?

TAG: Nala_017_f
Come on. Really dig down deep and *ROAR*!

TAG: Nala_018_f
Grr! Roar!

TAG: Nala_019_f
I suppose that's good enough.

TAG: Nala_043_f
That was... cute... but it won't scare off even one hyena.

TAG: Nala_003_f
Say... can your species roar?

TAG: Nala_005_f
You mean humans? Because, I'm a human.

TAG: Nala_040_f
Well, can HUMANS roar?

TAG: Nala_004_f
Say, can giant hairless meerkats roar?

TAG: Nala_041_f
Giant hairless...? Oh, ha. That was just a joke. I'm actually a human.
