Hmm. I don't see Simba.

TAG: Nala_001_f
But the good news is, I don't see anything around here that would want to eat you either.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's a relief.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe I can help you look for Simba.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm a little insulted. I'm a buffet-and-a-half.

TAG: Nala_002_f
I can imagine. And it means we can cover more ground looking for Simba.

TAG: Nala_006_f
I'll look around here. Why don't you <Lore>look for Simba on the other side of the river over there?</Lore>

TAG: Nala_011_f
I'll need to find some way to get across. Maybe if I could knock over those logs...

TAG: Nala_007_f
Hey... Simba won't think I'm a hyena out to get him like you did, right? I don't want another... misunderstanding.

TAG: Nala_008_f
If you aren't a threat, he's very friendly.

TAG: Nala_009_f
If he bares his teeth, just <Lore>say, "hakuna matata."</Lore> He'll know you're a friend.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Okay. Here goes nothing.

TAG: Nala_003_f
That would be great. It is a pretty big jungle.

TAG: Nala_004_f
All the animals in the jungle should be coming out for a bite of me. Is it my scent? What's the problem here?

TAG: Nala_005_f
I'm going to assume you're joking. But let's not push our luck. We should keep looking for Simba.
