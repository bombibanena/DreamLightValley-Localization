{PlayerName}, last night the <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem> started to glow.

TAG: Nala_004_f
It's time to close those rifts once and for all. Are you ready?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll be back later.

TAG: Nala_000_f
Based on that Memory we uncovered in Pride Rock, we need to put these <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem> inside the <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Nala_001_f
But I don't remember how... Ugh! Why doesn't any of this make sense to me?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll understand it enough for both of us.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We don't have to understand it. We just need to fix it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
At least we can be confused together.

TAG: Nala_015_f
You're right. I shouldn't get upset. We can work on this together.

TAG: Nala_002_f
But if I'm going to understand it, I need someone to explain it to me first... Looks like I have to <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_006_f
That's right. We left those old <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> with her. Maybe she's had time to figure out how they work.

TAG: Nala_020_f
I'll keep watch over the rifts and try to catch fish for the others while you talk to her.

TAG: Nala_016_f
You're right. And now, we might finally be able to.

TAG: Nala_018_f
First, I'll have to <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_017_f
That's true. All this "magic" stuff still bewilders me.

TAG: Nala_005_f
All the more reason to find somebody else who understands it! Let's <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_009_f
Please hurry. I don't know how long we can wait.
