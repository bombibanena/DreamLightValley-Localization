When we were cubs, Simba and I raced each other and practiced our pouncing.

Did you have a favorite game when you were a cub?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Tag.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hide-and-seek.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Something else.

TAG: Nala_002_f
That's when you chase and try to catch each other, right?

TAG: Nala_004_f
We did that too!

TAG: Nala_003_f
We did that too! I usually won.

TAG: Nala_005_f
And if I didn't, it's because Simba would cheat.

TAG: Nala_006_f
He'd convince the flamingos to hide him under their wings.

TAG: Nala_007_f
Oh. What was it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Tic-tac-toe.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Leapfrog.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I played video games, mostly.

TAG: Nala_008_f
I've never heard of that. Does it have something to do with toes?

TAG: Nala_009_f
Not exactly. Don't worry about it. It's not a great game for a lion.

TAG: Nala_010_f
I think we played that. We watched frogs and pretended to hop like them.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Or we chased them. That was fun too.

TAG: Nala_012_f
What are those?

TAG: Nala_013_f
I could try to teach you to play them.

TAG: Nala_014_f
But it might be a little tough to use a joystick with paws...
