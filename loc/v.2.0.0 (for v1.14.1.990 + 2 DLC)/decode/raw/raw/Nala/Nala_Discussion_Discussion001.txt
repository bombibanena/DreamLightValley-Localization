Hello, {PlayerName}. I'm really having fun in your Village.

TAG: Nala_002_f
But I was wondering... how do you keep your pride content with such a large territory?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Magic. I use magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's a lot of work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It requires unique talent.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Magic? I'm not sure what you mean.

TAG: Nala_003_f
You know. Enchantments, spells, potions...

TAG: Nala_004_f
Sorry. I'm not familiar with those. But my friend Rafiki might be. He can sense things most of us can't.

TAG: Nala_010_f
At home, I hunt to feed our pride. That's a lot of work too.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Let me know if you need help, {PlayerName}. I'd be happy to assist.

TAG: Nala_012_f
What sort of talent?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Organization.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Knowing when to say no.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Juggling.

TAG: Nala_013_f
I understand. That's the secret to a successful hunt, too.

TAG: Nala_014_f
It's smart to take care of yourself. If you're exhausted, you can't really help anyone.

TAG: Nala_015_f
Oh, Timon does that with small fruit. You must be very good at it, if you juggle for everyone in the Village.
