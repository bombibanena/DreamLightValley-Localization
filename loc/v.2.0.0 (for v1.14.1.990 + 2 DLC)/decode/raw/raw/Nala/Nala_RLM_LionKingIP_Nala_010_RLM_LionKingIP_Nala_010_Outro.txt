Wow, you weren't kidding about this place. It's beautiful.

TAG: Nala_006_f
It already feels like I have friends here.

TAG: Nala_010_f
I hope Simba comes to join us soon.

TAG: Nala_011_f
I'll go talk to him. For now, you just enjoy the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You could explore the Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You could find something to eat.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You could start meeting the other Villagers.

TAG: Nala_007_f
Say, where's Simba?

TAG: Nala_008_f
He said he'd come meet us soon. He wanted some time alone.

TAG: Nala_009_f
The fight with the hyenas... I think it brought back some old memories about his father.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Speaking of old memories...

TAG: Nala_002_f
I think I've been here before.

TAG: Nala_003_f
You used to live here, Nala. Back before the Forgetting.

TAG: Nala_004_f
It might take a while for all your memories to come back. Just try to take it slow.

TAG: Nala_005_f
This is amazing! I can't believe I ever forgot this place.

TAG: Nala_014_f
There's so much to see. I'll do some scouting and see what I find.

TAG: Nala_020_f
There's just one thing I have to warn you about.

TAG: Nala_021_f
Watch out for Scar.

TAG: Nala_022_f
Scar is here? That'sâ How is that possible?

TAG: Nala_023_f
I watched him fall from Pride Rock and... he can't have survived.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He's pretty cunning.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Anything is possible in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Scar's not so bad. I've got him well-trained.

TAG: Nala_026_f
Who knows how he survived. But I wouldn't put anything past him.

TAG: Nala_024_f
I guess you're right.

TAG: Nala_025_f
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on Scar. He better not try anything, or I'll put a stop to it.

TAG: Nala_027_f
The rules here... they're pretty different from anywhere else. Maybe this isn't quite the Scar you remember.

TAG: Nala_028_f
Oh... I guess there's a lot I don't understand about this place yet.

TAG: Nala_029_f
I've practically turned him into a housecat. You don't need to worry.

TAG: Nala_030_f
I hope you're right. But I'm going to keep an eye on him... just in case.

TAG: Nala_012_f
That's a great idea. I bet some of these rivers and ponds have fish I could eat.

TAG: Nala_015_f
That would certainly beat grubs.

TAG: Nala_017_f
I'd really like that.

TAG: Nala_018_f
One can never have too many friends.
