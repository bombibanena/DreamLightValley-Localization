You put the <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> down by the rifts?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I just hope this works.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Have you noticed any change?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Another problem solved by {PlayerName}!

TAG: Nala_008_f
Me too.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Wait...

TAG: Nala_012_f
My whiskers are twitching again. Just like they did when the rifts first opened.

TAG: Nala_013_f
Do you feel that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I feel... something.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Feel what?! What's happening?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Uh, I think this might be a lion thing.

TAG: Nala_014_f
It's so strong. I can feel it tingling in my paws...

TAG: Nala_023_f
And they smell kind of delicious.

TAG: Player_002_f
You want to eat them...?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Me too. They look tasty.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll admit, I am a little curious.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Ew. Nala! No eating interdimensional nastiness.

TAG: Nala_007_f
I... I think the rifts are closing!

TAG: Nala_017_f
Did you see those flashes of light in the distance?

TAG: Nala_018_f
And that awful smell is gone.

TAG: Nala_019_f
I think it's really over, {PlayerName}. We sealed the rifts, for good this time.

TAG: Nala_020_f
Oh, hold on... There's a new smell...

TAG: Nala_021_f
Those fish that swam through the rifts are still here.

TAG: Nala_022_f
But they're different somehow. They smell like... regular fish... real fish.

TAG: Nala_026_f
Maybe we're just hungry. But I agree.

TAG: Nala_029_f
I guess we won't know until we try it.

TAG: Nala_025_f
I'll <Lore>catch some of the fish and bring them to Remy</Lore> to see if they can be made into anything edible.

TAG: Nala_000_f
Though, I bet those fish don't like warm water very much. I'll probably need to wait until it's a little cooler to catch them.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Maybe if I try fishing in the morning or in the evening, when the sun's not as high in the sky...

TAG: Nala_024_f
They didn't look very tasty. But lots of delicious stuff doesn't.

TAG: Nala_030_f
Like those grubs Simba had me eat.

TAG: Nala_027_f
That stuff could make you sick. Or worse.

TAG: Nala_031_f
Maybe you'd get indigestion. Or maybe you'd start popping in and out of the Here and There.

TAG: Nala_032_f
They don't smell dangerous anymore. Like I said, they smell just like other fish.

TAG: Nala_015_f
It's not just my whiskers. I can feel this... tingling... in my paws.

TAG: Nala_016_f
It can't be. It's so strong. Can't you feel that tingling in your feet?

TAG: Nala_009_f
Not yet.

TAG: Nala_010_f
I don't know if it's solved just yet. We should wait and see if the rifts close...
