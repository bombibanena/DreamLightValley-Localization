Hey, Beast...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Your fur is SO shiny today!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're looking very... serious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you brooding AGAIN?

TAG: Beast_003_f
I didn't do anything different.

TAG: Beast_009_f
... But... thank you. That was very nice of you to say.

TAG: Beast_010_f
Can I talk to you about something?

TAG: Player_001_f
You know Mushu, right?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He wants to help build up your confidence.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He thinks you look sad.

TAG: Beast_012_f
He... wants to help me? How? Why?

TAG: Beast_013_f
I thought opening my Greenhouse helped the Village accept me.

TAG: Beast_015_f
I think... Mushu wants to help you accept YOURSELF. He's got some kind of program that he thinks will help.

TAG: Beast_016_f
I don't know. That makes me...

TAG: Beast_017_f
Nervous.

TAG: Player_003_f
Would it help if I do Mushu's program with you?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
We can go through it together.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
It will prove Mushu is trustworthy.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I should be there in case it's a disaster.

TAG: Beast_018_f
That would make me more comfortable. Hmm...

TAG: Beast_021_f
Tell Mushu I will accept his help... please.

TAG: Beast_019_f
I trust him. It's myself I don't trust. Hmm...

TAG: Beast_020_f
Hmm. Perhaps with you, it won't be... bad.

TAG: Beast_014_f
I... I've been trying to understand how to make the Villagers... accept me.

TAG: Beast_011_f
I am not... sad. I'm... something else.

TAG: Beast_002_f
I suppose I am serious.

TAG: Beast_007_f
I'm sorry if that bothers you.

TAG: Beast_008_f
I'm just making conversation.

TAG: Beast_004_f
No. I'm... *sigh* Fine, I may be brooding...

TAG: Beast_005_f
...a little.
