Hey, Beast. I need something to help Pumbaa brush his teeth. You don't have a spare brush around?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It would be REALLY helpful.

... Do you brush your teeth?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Preferably one that's good for tusks...

TAG: Beast_002_f
Of course. I'd be honored to help Pumbaa. He is very kind.

TAG: Beast_004_f
There is a spare <Lore>toothbrush in my home</Lore>. You are welcome to find it for Pumbaa.

TAG: Beast_001_f
Of course I do. My, uh... condition in no way affects my personal hygiene habits.

TAG: Beast_003_f
Yes.
