Remember how you were asking me to teach you about fine dining, Olaf?

Well, look at these meals that {PlayerName} made.

Whoa! These aren't meals, Anna.

They're works of art.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Right?! {PlayerName} did such a good job.

Maybe I'll open a food museum where all you can do is look and smell. No eating allowed. That'd be fun, right?
