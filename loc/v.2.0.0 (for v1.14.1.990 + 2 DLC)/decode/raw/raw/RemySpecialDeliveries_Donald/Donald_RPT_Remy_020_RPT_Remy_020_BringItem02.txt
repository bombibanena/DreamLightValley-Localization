Oh boy! Those desserts look delicious, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Donald_001_f
I wish I could eat them myself...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why can't you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are they a gift for someone?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you using them as fishing bait?

TAG: Donald_002_f
Because I need them for something...

TAG: Donald_005_f
These are... um... they're apology desserts.

TAG: Donald_006_f
You might not have noticed, but sometimes I lose my temper.

TAG: Donald_007_f
And even though it's always for a very good reason, I OCCASIONALLY say something I shouldn't.

TAG: Donald_008_f
But now, when that happens, I'll have these desserts to give out as apologies.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What if these go bad before you need to apologize?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What if you run out of desserts from having to apologize so much?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
What if you eat them before you can give them out?

TAG: Donald_009_f
Uh... heh-heh... I wish I thought that was going to happen.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Oh, I almost forgot. Here's a tip for bringing these to me.

TAG: Donald_010_f
I guess I'll have to order more from Remy. Oh boy, this could get expensive.

TAG: Donald_011_f
Who do I look like? Goofy? Don't worry. I have excellent self-control!

TAG: Donald_003_f
It's something like that...

TAG: Donald_004_f
Fishing bait?! Why would I waste good desserts like that?! You've got it all wrong.
