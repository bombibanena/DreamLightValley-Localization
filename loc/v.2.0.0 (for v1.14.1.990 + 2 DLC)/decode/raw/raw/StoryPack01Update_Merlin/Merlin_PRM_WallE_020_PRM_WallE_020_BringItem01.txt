I've got a little something for you, Merlin!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Wha...? Oh... {PlayerName}, what's this? A magical object you'd like me to examine?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sort of...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Afraid not.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess that's up to you!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Well, go on. What is it?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
It's an invitation... to a magical moment with someone secret!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
An invitation to a... whatnow? Oh no. No time. Mustn't have any distractions. I've research to do!

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Besides, I find social occasions rather a nuisance. Too much talking and too few books!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Was Madam Mim the last person you went out with?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Time to put on your most charming wizard hat!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Just relax and try to have a good time!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
What?! That is utter poppycock! I'll have you know I have always endeavored to spend as little time with Mim as possible!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
My apologies!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Please, Merlin. Just swing by <ActivityItem>Dazzle Beach</ActivityItem> at the time listed on the invitation. I promise you'll have fun.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
You'll experience a whole new type of magic!

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Well, if you insist...

TAG: Merlin_020_f
I do! And WALLÂ·E agrees!

TAG: Merlin_021_f
*sigh* Very well, then. I suppose I'll look at it as an experiment.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
This IS my most charming wizard hat.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Isn't that your only wizard hat?

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Why, yes... but... but that's beside the point!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
It also happens to be very charming.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
I... guess that makes sense.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Trust me: I'd have a far better time in the library...

TAG: Merlin_015_f
...relaxing with a good book instead of indulging this nonsense.
