Hey, quick question. If you had to choose, which name do you like better...

TAG: Flynn_001_f
...Flynn Rider or Eugene Fitzherbert?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Flynn.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Eugene.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I like them both!

TAG: Flynn_002_f
I know, right? It's more interesting, daring, exciting...

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Eugene's boring. Who'd want to be named that? Not me, that's for sure.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Really? You think "Eugene" is better than "Flynn Rider"? Isn't it kind of... bland?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's unique!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's interesting.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
So you think "Eugene Fitzherbert" is a more interesting name than "Flynn Rider"?

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Well, you're the second one to think that.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
You really think so?

TAG: Flynn_008_f
I... well, guess I've got something to think about then.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Really? How can you not have an opinion on this? They're completely different names.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Or maybe... you're saying that it's not the name that's important, but the person behind the name?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Exactly.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm just indecisive.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Huh... I'll have to think about that.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Hey, totally fair. I, for one, never make decisive choices if I can help it.
