Hey, {PlayerName}! Got a sec? I could use your help with some lingering Wolf of the Wilds stuff.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure, what's up?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry, I'm busy right now!

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Weeellll... if I'm being perfectly honest â which I promise I am â I'm having a little trouble shaking some unfortunate wolfy habits.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
"Wolfy habits"?

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Yeah. For example, I just want to chase stuff. Constantly!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What can I do?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That doesn't sound good...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm scared to ask but... what do you mean?

TAG: Flynn_009_f
It's those frog things made out of paper. They're everywhere and they're so irresistible!

TAG: Flynn_001_f
I literally HAVE to chase them whenever I see them.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
You must mean the Frog Snippets! That does sound pretty frustrating.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
What if I go <Lore>catch some of the Frog Snippets</Lore> to help you out?

TAG: Flynn_015_f
That would be amazing!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Once I've cleared a few, I'll <Lore>ask the Lorekeeper</Lore> if there's a way to keep them away from you.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Oh, you don't know how much I appreciate this, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
It most certainly is not...

TAG: Flynn_012_f
I'm telling you: Those frog things are irresistible!

TAG: Flynn_011_f
It's not so much scary as ridiculous.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
You know those frog things hopping all over the place? They're completely irresistible to me.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Understood. We'll talk about it later!
