Oh, hey, {PlayerName}! Just who I was hoping to see.

TAG: Flynn_001_f
I was wondering if maybe you could help me smooth something over with someone.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
I was trying to be helpful. You know, share some of the skills I've learned along the way. But Merida... Well, let's just say, that's not how she saw it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Merida's a world-class archer. She doesn't need your advice.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It came from a good place, but it was a bit thoughtless.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You shouldn't have assumed, and she could have handled it better.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
I know that now! But I didn't when I tried to help her. Still, it was wrong of me to assume.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
But Merida didn't just yell at me.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
She found my collection of wanted posters and tacked them up all around my House.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
She knows how much it bothers me that none of them get my nose right. Now I have to see them all, every time I leave my House!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Serves you right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Merida would never!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That wasn't cool of her.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Go ahead. Laugh it up. I promise I've learned my lesson. So...

TAG: Flynn_013_f
If you see any of those posters around my House, could you <Lore>help me take them down</Lore>?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
And hey, if you see Merida again... tell her I'm sorry. I never meant to offend her. And next time, I'll keep my advice to myself.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Oh, she would. Go take a look for yourself.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
THANK you! Though I have to give her credit; it was a pretty good prank.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
I get that now.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
You don't know the half of it.
