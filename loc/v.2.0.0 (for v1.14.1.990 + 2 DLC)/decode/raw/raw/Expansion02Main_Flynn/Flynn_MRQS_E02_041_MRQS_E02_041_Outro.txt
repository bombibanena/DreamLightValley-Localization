Well, {PlayerName}, I have one thing to say... Do not hire whoever planned that party to take care of my next birthday.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
That was seriously odd.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I liked it. But I'm kind of odd myself.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Got it. Cake, candles, and some pointy hats are more your style.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Noted! I'll remember that next time we throw a celebration in your honor.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
And for what it's worth... you're MY kind of odd.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
In any case, I did some scouting and it looks like that beanstalk to Maleficent's castle just grew a little more!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Which means it's long enough now for us to <Lore>climb it</Lore> to get into Maleficent's castle.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
You already cleared all the ink blocking the way.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Guess all that's left to do is head inside and... well... <Lore>confront Maleficent</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Whatever happens... I'm with you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
But first, you'll have to clear all that ink blocking the way.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Once you do that, there won't be anything stopping you from <Lore>confronting Maleficent</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
It looks like we still have to <Lore>find one more Fairy Tale Trial</Lore> before we can climb all the way up.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Maybe we should <Lore>check out the Fallen Fortress</Lore> to the west?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
You'll have to <Lore>clear away all the ink</Lore> around the place first, though.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
You already cleared away the ink blocking <Lore>the Fallen Fortress</Lore>. Let's go look around there for the Fairy Tale Trial.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Huh. I've never had a party like that... It doesn't sound half bad, though.
