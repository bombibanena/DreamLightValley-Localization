Whoa. Sorry, friend, I don't do backstory.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Please?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Does it involve an orphanage?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But we're friends!

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Don't give me those big puppy eyes. I have a reputation to maintain.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
And sometimes a fake reputation is all a man has.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Maybe I'll tell you once we've gotten to know each other better. Sound good?

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Shh, not so loud! I have a reputation to maintain.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Yes. We're friends. But even friends don't have to tell each other everything.
