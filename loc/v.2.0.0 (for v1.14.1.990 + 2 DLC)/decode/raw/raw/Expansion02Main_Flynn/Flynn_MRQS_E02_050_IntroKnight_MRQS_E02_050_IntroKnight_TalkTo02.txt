You're wearing the knight armor! Nicely done. And may I say, it fits you perfectly.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
But... the drawbridge still isn't lowering. That means there are more things you need to do before you're really a knight.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
I'm thinking you need a <Lore>squire</Lore>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's a squire?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why don't you be my squire?

TAG: Flynn_004_f
It's like a knight in training. A knight's apprentice. A junior assistant to the knight...

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Look, you get it, right?

TAG: Flynn_007_f
So why don't you be my squire?

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Whoaaa! No, no, no. The squire is always an annoying little sidekick who can't stop getting into trouble.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
C'mon, Flynn. It's just to get us inside.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You owe me one, Flynn!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Soooo, the role fits you perfectly?

TAG: Flynn_008_f
*sigh* All right...

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Fine! I'll be your squire.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
Your dashing, debonair, devastatingly charming squire.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Now, the next thing you need to be a knight is to <Lore>defeat a mythical beast</Lore>.

TAG: Player_002_f
Hmmm. Defeat a mythical beast. What about...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...Maleficent? She can change into a dragon, right?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...you? I defeated the Wolf of the Wilds, didn't I?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...one of those cute little dragons around Everafter?

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Uh, for your first mythical beast, I suggest starting a little smaller.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
Some kind of starter mythical beast. You know, just to get your feet wet.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
How about those <Lore>funny little dragons</Lore> all over Everafter?

TAG: Flynn_021_f
Try <Lore>taming one of the small dragons</Lore>. That just might make you a real knight!

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Huh. I actually appreciate you calling me a mythical beast, but I don't think I count.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
I think your best bet would be those <Lore>funny little dragons</Lore> all over Everafter.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Hmm. They are cute, aren't they? But I'm sure they'd count.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
I guess you did save me from that curse.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Hey!

TAG: Flynn_011_f
*sigh* Though I guess you did save me from that curse.
