It's impossible.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Nobody can do that! Not even me!

Face it, Flynn. Merida is an amazing archer.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I barely believed my own eyes.

Maybe we should call it the Merida Trick Shot from now on?

TAG: Flynn_006_f
You know, you're right. And there's no shame in admitting she's a far better archer than me.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
The truth is, after that curse and playing Maleficent's lackey for a while... I think I just needed a win.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
But... that trick was wrong. I owe Merida an apology.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Me neither. But there's no denying it. Merida's the better archer. MUCH better.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
It would make sense, since she's the one who actually managed to pull it off.
