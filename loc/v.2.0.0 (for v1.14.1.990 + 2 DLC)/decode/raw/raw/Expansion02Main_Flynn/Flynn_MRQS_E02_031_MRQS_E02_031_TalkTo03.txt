Whoa. That was so strange.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Did I just wake up from some kind of nightmare?

TAG: Flynn_004_f
A very long, freakishly weird nightmare where I was compelled to howl at the moon and chase rabbits?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You were under some sort of spell.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're not STILL trying to trick me, are you?

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Oh... right! It's all coming back to me now!

TAG: Flynn_016_f
<Lore>Flynn Rider</Lore>, at your service. How's your day going?

TAG: Flynn_025_f
How did you wind up down here?

TAG: Flynn_005_f
The last thing I remember clearly is Maleficent <Lore>cursing me</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
She wanted me to guard something for her in her castle.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
I told her, guarding, ehhh, that's not really my thing.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Occasional larceny; that IS on my resume.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
But once Maleficent gets an idea in her head...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How did you end up here if you were guarding it in her castle?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Well, you're free now. Think you could help me?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
I'm... I'm not really sure. The whole Vale got shaken up, and then all that ink started spilling out of the ground...

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Next thing I knew... I was here. It's like <Lore>parts of Maleficent's castle</Lore> have been scattered all over the Vale.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Like pages of a storybook, scattered to the wind...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Sure, if you want to be poetic about it.

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Ya know, you're starting to remind me of this amazing girl I know... *sigh*

TAG: Flynn_000_f
Hello! Flynn!

TAG: Flynn_020_f
Your "den" here is causing a whole lot of trouble.

TAG: Flynn_021_f
It seems to be the source of the corruption spreading throughout the Vale... the Neverafter.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
Got any idea how we can fix it?

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Well, the power of the curse â it seemed to come from <Lore>that thing over there</Lore> behind me.

TAG: Flynn_023_f
Maybe try poking it? I don't know. Magic is also not my thing.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
Heh. Yeah, me too.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
It's no trick. Honest!
