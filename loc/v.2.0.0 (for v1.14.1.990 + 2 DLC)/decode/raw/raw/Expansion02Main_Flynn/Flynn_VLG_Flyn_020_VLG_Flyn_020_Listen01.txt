Lorekeeper, I've been having a nightmare about this princess. She just keeps running away from me...

She looks scared. And it all feels so familiar, like it's more of a memory than a dream.

This is concerning...

TAG: Flynn_003_f
What is it? Do you see something about me in your pages?

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Quite the opposite, in fact. There doesn't seem to be any story about you at all.

I'm afraid you'll have to remember this one on your own, Flynn Rider.
