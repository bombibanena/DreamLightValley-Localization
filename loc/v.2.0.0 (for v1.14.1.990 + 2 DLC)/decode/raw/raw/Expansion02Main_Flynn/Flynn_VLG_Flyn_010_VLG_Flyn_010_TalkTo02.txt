Hi Flynn! Everyone's items have been returned and no one is upset with you.

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Oh, I cannot tell you what a relief that is!

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Um... no offense, but this place is a bit of a mess.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is everything all right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How did this happen?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did you become the Wolf again?

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Huh? Oh, yeah. Of course. I'm fine.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
You don't seem fine.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
What? Can't a guy live in a little squalor without being interrogated about it?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm just worried about you.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I've never seen you like this.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Defensive much?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
It really seems like you're sad about something.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Sad? ME? Don't be ridiculous.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
I mean, sure, things are kind of a mess in here, and I DID just spend a bunch of time under Maleficent's curse...

TAG: Flynn_027_f
...but I definitely do NOT miss <Lore>Rapunzel</Lore> in an almost incapacitating way.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
And I'm most definitely not sad about it.

TAG: Flynn_028_f
Ah, so THAT'S what's going on! You miss Rapunzel!

TAG: Flynn_030_f
Hey, just because every time I think about talking to her I get nervous and my hands get strangely sweaty, that doesn't mean I MISS her.

TAG: Flynn_033_f
Flynn... You're hung up on a girl! That's OKAY. I can help you with this.

TAG: Flynn_038_f
Look. Handsome rogues like me don't get hung up on people. Even someone as wonderful as Rapunzel.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's GOOD to have feelings, Flynn.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds like denial to me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Stop being stubborn. Let me help you.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
Sure, uh-huh. For you, maybe.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Okay... I'm not getting through to you. Maybe you need to talk to someone who's been through something like you have.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Okay, I'll bite. Who do you suggest?

TAG: Flynn_036_f
I was thinking Kristoff! Kristoff and Anna's relationship might have a lot of lessons for you.

TAG: Flynn_034_f
He and Anna struggled a lot when he had to give up his memories. That was like a curse.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
He's the only person I know in the Valley who might be able to relate to you.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
... Okay, fine. If it will make YOU feel better, I'll talk to Kristoff.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
I'll fill him in on the details, so you don't have to worry about that.

TAG: Flynn_035_f
He's dealing with a curse of his own. He can't remember Anna. And they're supposed to be engaged!

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Denial? Me? Never.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
I appreciate the concern, but you don't have to worry.

TAG: Flynn_031_f
Wait. You know about Rapunzel?

TAG: Flynn_026_f
But I definitely do NOT miss <Lore>a certain blond girl</Lore> in an almost incapacitating way.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Not sure.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Come on, Flynn; what's going on?

TAG: Flynn_005_f
I don't think so...

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Then what's going on in here?
