{PlayerName}! I am so glad you're here. I've been having the strangest nightmares, and you're just the person to help me work out what they mean.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd love to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry, I'm busy right now!

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Tell me about these nightmares.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
It's so odd... all of them feature a woman with blonde hair.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
A princess, by the looks of it.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Rapunzel? Is this that same "special someone" that you're so hung up on?

TAG: Flynn_006_f
That's the funny thing. It's definitely not her.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Whoever she is, she's... familiar, and yet I can't quite place her.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
And in the nightmare...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Does she speak to you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Does she do anything interesting?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Can you see her face at all?

TAG: Flynn_009_f
No, she never says a word.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
She's too busy running away.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
I think... I think she's running away from ME. I couldn't stand it if somehow I frightened her.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Is this something to do with the Wolf of the Wilds?

TAG: Flynn_018_f
I... I don't know... it's all a mess in my mind.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
Okay, I have an idea. We need to <Lore>talk to the Lorekeeper</Lore>. I have a feeling this is linked to your past, and she might know the whole story.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Mostly, she just runs.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
Runs?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Yeah, like she's scared of something.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Not really, but I can tell she's scared.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Like she's running away...

TAG: Flynn_003_f
No problem. Let's talk about it later.
