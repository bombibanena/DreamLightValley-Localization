Flynn! When I used my magic on the source of the curse inside the Fairy Tale Trial...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I need to get to Maleficent to save the Storybook Vale.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Come on. You're not scared, are you?

TAG: Flynn_008_f
I heard this rumbling. It looks like a <Lore>beanstalk</Lore> started to grow towards Maleficent's castle.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
If we <Lore>find more Fairy Tale Trials</Lore>, maybe the beanstalk will grow big enough for us to climb up to the castle!

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Huh. Giant beanstalk. Well, that would be an EXCELLENT method of entry when trying to rob a castle.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Trust me; in my thieving days, I learned you can climb all sorts of things.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Trellises, ropes, hair...

TAG: Flynn_012_f
... Wait a second. Did you say Maleficent's castle?

TAG: Flynn_013_f
You want me to climb back INTO Maleficent's castle?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
One small question. ... WHY?!

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Well, that's very noble of you. Just a little warning...

TAG: Flynn_018_f
The last time I got near Maleficent, I wound up with a curse on me.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
If you're not careful, you're gonna be howling at the moon too.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Speaking of that curse, I'm almost feeling back to my charming, roguish self.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Anything else I can do to help you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Almost? What more do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No lasting wolfish side effects?

TAG: Flynn_003_f
It would be nice to have a place to relax while I'm here.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
That makes sense. I'll put down some foundations and talk to Mr. McDuck about getting a place set up for you!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
I wouldn't say that. I keep getting this urge to lift up my back leg to scratch myself behind the ear.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
But mostly, I just really want my own den.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
Deliberately challenging Maleficent isn't brave.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
It's foolish with an extra helping of ridiculous on top!
