Hey, {PlayerName}. Need my help with something?

TAG: Flynn_008_f
I'm a man of many talents, you know.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
I could lower from the ceiling and grab something?

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Or maybe charm someone into giving up a key?

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Ooh, or scale a huge tower?

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Those are all Flynn Rider specialties.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Can you really do all those things?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
How about lowering a drawbridge to a fortress?

TAG: Flynn_013_f
Of course I can!

TAG: Flynn_014_f
And I've got the frying pan lumps to prove it. Don't ask. Long story.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Well, I do need somebody who can help me lower a drawbridge.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
Right. The castle with the crumbling walls in Everafter...

TAG: Flynn_017_f
I tried to get in there once, but there's some sort of magic protection spell on it.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
It'll only open for a knight.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
You know, the place sort of reminds me of a fortress from a story that I read as a kid.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Maybe it IS the place from that story!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Did you learn anything from those stories that might help us?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Apologies, but you don't strike me as somebody who reads.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
The Lorekeeper told me this place is MADE of stories â the stories we all loved as kids. It makes sense, doesn't it?

TAG: Flynn_021_f
Could be. And if that's it, then maybe what I learned about being a knight from those stories could help us get inside!

TAG: Flynn_002_f
I used to read tons of stories about dashing heroes and brave knights back in the orphaâ

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Uh, I mean, back when I was younger.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
For a while I even wanted to be a knight... before I settled on being an extremely charming and attractive swashbuckling rogue.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'd much rather be a dashing and heroic knight.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Being a swashbuckling rogue seems way more fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why not both?

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Well, if you ask me, I think you could totally pull off the armor.

TAG: Flynn_025_f
And if we want to trick this drawbridge into thinking you're a knight, then that's the first thing we're gonna need.

TAG: Flynn_026_f
Every knight needs <Lore>a suit of shining armor</Lore>!

TAG: Flynn_027_f
You know, I've got this old drawing I made once when I was a kid. Maybe you could make THAT for yourself?

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Trust me, it is. Only one problem. You don't get a great suit of armor.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
A swashbuckling knight? That would be interesting. You get to have fun AND wear a great suit of armor.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
You know, I think I did.

TAG: Flynn_023_f
Well, I don't have much time for it these days. Too busy LIVING adventures to read them.

TAG: Flynn_024_f
But as a kid? You bet I did. For a kid with nothing, reading about possibility was everything.
