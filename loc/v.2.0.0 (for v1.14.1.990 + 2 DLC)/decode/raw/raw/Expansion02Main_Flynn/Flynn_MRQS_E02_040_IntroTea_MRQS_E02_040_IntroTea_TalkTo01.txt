I've got something to show you, Flynn.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Whoa! How did you draw that? It looks so real!

TAG: Flynn_003_f
It's a picture. I used my camera. Uh, you know what, just think of it as like a... magic portrait machine.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Sure. Whatever you say... Hold on â this magic portrait machine... Think it could get a picture of me that gets my nose right? Sketch artists always mess it up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It could, yeah.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe later. More important things now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm afraid your nose is just too perfect for photography to capture.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Great! We'll have to schedule that in between all my other roguish adventures.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Great idea! Let's <Lore>talk to the Lorekeeper</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Er, but, seriously, are you showing me this magic portrait for a reason...?

TAG: Flynn_010_f
I was trying to explore the Teapot Falls in Everafter and I came across these things blocking the way.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Have you ever seen them before?

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Huh. Now that you mention it... I have seen them.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
There were a couple of them inside the Fairy Tale Trial that I was cursed to protect.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
I wish I knew more about how to get rid of them.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Hey, maybe there's a book you could read in the Library of Lore?

TAG: Flynn_016_f
Or a book you could talk to! The Lorekeeper probably knows something.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
More important than accurately portraying my nose? Not likely.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Wow. I'm telling you: It's a curse to be this handsome.
