Well, the Snippet problem should be taken care of now.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
I placed some repellent near your House. Those Frog Snippets shouldn't be bothering you anymore.

TAG: Flynn_000_f
You are a LIFESAVER, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was nothing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I had a little help from the Lorekeeper.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I am pretty amazing, aren't I?

TAG: Flynn_003_f
To you, maybe. But to me?

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Anything that makes me feel a little more like myself is just...

TAG: Flynn_009_f
...indescribable. I can't tell you how creepy it is not to recognize who you see in the mirror.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
I'm so glad I could help. Anything else you need?

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Well, since you're here... while I was at my peak wolfishness, I developed another bad habit.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Meaning...?

TAG: Flynn_013_f
Apparently, I started burying things. Other people's things.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That actually makes sense.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Oof, that's not great.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You didn't bury MY things, did you?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
You thought you were a wolf; burying things is almost to be expected.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
That's really understanding of you.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
You couldn't control yourself; remember that.

TAG: Flynn_025_f
True. But that's no excuse.

TAG: Flynn_027_f
Anyway... I'm pretty sure I buried some of the things outside my House. Think you could find <Lore>those for me and help figure out who they belong to</Lore>?

TAG: Flynn_028_f
I can handle that. You should stay here in case anyone comes around looking for their stuff. You can reassure them that I'm on it!

TAG: Flynn_015_f
You basically stole from people and then hid their stuff.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
I know, I know! I feel terrible.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
All we have to do is find and return everything, and no one will be upset.

TAG: Flynn_021_f
You weren't yourself under that curse.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
No, I didn't touch any of your stuff.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
Whew!

TAG: Flynn_023_f
But I took things from other friends. GOOD folks who didn't deserve it.

TAG: Flynn_024_f
You didn't know what you were doing, Flynn.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
That's great, but don't sell yourself short.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Thanks to you, I feel a little more like myself, and that's just...

TAG: Flynn_005_f
You are! You really saved me today.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
And now I'm starting to feel more like ME, and that's just...
