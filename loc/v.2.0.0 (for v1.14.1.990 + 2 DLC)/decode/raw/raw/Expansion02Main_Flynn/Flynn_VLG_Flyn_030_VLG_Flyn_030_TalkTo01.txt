So what did you find in the corridors?

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Nothing good. One is blocked by a giant wall that will only come down with fire, another is covered in really thick smoke, and the last has a door that can only be opened if we hit an unreachable target.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Hmm. Yeah, that doesn't sound great.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Any chance you have unknown powers that can take on all of that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Odds are pretty small.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Well, in a world where anything is possible...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is that a serious question?

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Aw, come on! We need to think positively!

TAG: Flynn_007_f
No amount of positivity is going to help me reach the unreachable, Flynn.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Point taken. Well, I guess it's time to recruit a crew! First, we need to <Lore>find someone who can breathe in smoke and can see in the dark</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
We'll also need <Lore>some way to blow up that wall</Lore>. I can rig it with fireworks if you find someone who can light them.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
And for the third one, we need someone who can reach that target. Maybe <Lore>someone good with a bow and arrow</Lore>?

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Okay, I'll go ask around and see if any Villagers want to help out.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
You should keep an eye out for Maleficent and make sure she doesn't catch on to our plan.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Still no.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Wow, way to get my hopes up and then dash them to pieces.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
You were asking if I can reach the unreachable, Flynn.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
... Yes?

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Then to answer seriously: No, I am not suddenly able to reach the unreachable.
