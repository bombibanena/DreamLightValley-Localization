Can I talk to you, Flynn?

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Sure. What do you need?

TAG: Flynn_002_f
I spoke to Kristoff...

TAG: Flynn_025_f
Sounds to me like I was right. You're missing Rapunzel.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
... Okay. Fine. I admit it. I MISS Rapunzel.

TAG: Flynn_027_f
Why don't I set you two up for a little reunion?

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. But honestly? Right now, I'm not ready to see her again.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
I've got unfinished business with Maleficent to take care of first.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Does that make sense?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Totally!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think I see where you're coming from.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Not to me.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Even though the Wolf wasn't really you, there's still some cleanup to be done.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Exactly!

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Once I've dealt with Maleficent... well, then I'll be ready.

TAG: Flynn_024_f
I understand.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
I guess handsome rogues like me DO have feelings after all, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Proud of you, Flynn.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're going to be okay.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I knew it all along!

TAG: Flynn_029_f
I'll be around if ever you need help with anything else.

TAG: Flynn_030_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. You're a true friend. When I figure out more about what happened with Maleficent, I'll let you know.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Nothing that happened under Maleficent's curse was your fault. Everyone understands that.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
It might not have been my fault. But I still need to fix it.

TAG: Flynn_026_f
Sounds to me like I was right. You're hung up on a girl.

TAG: Flynn_028_f
... Okay. Fine. I admit it. I am missing a certain someone. But...
