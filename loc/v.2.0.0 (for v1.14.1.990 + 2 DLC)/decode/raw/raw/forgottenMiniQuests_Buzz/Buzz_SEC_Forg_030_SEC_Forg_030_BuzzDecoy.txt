Hey Buzz... you told me you got knocked out the window once, right?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
It was an unpleasant incident I'd rather forget, but... yes, I did.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Would you say that felt a bit like being unfairly exiled?

TAG: Buzz_003_f
"Exiled" is a strong word, Space Ranger.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
I prefer to think of it as a misguided mistake.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
I'm trying to find someone who was unfairly exiled to help the Forgotten with a poem. Sounds like you're not the right Villager.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Do you want to give it a try anyway?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
See you around!

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Poetry is not exactly my forte. But I'll do whatever I can to assist. Let's hear it.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Here's what the Forgotten's written so far...

TAG: Buzz_008_f
<Lore>It seems there's no place I will ever belong...</Lore>

TAG: Buzz_009_f
<Lore>And all of my words seem to come out all wrong.</Lore>

TAG: Buzz_010_f
<Lore>But I'll wait for an answer, I'll wait for a sign...</Lore>

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Hmm... That is a fine problem. Those lines really shine, but I just can't think of a word that rhymes with "sign."

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Wish I could be of assistance... Guess I'm better at playing Space Ranger than poet.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
For now, I'll just have to keep looking for <Lore>someone who was unfairly exiled</Lore>.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
Of course. But if the Forgotten ever needs help organizing playtime, that I can do.
