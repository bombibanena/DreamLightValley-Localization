Focus on your memories of me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Pretend you're in a canoe, sailing through the fog...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Don't worry. The memories will come back.

TAG: Moana_001_f
Just think of all the memories we've made together since you've come back to the Village.

TAG: Moana_010_f
Well, you were an amazing kid. If that's the part of you that became the Forgotten... I hope there's still some way to save them.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Whoa... That is so strange! The moment you said that, it's like the fog lifted.

TAG: Moana_003_f
I do remember these. You and I used to play with them when you were just a little kid.

TAG: Moana_004_f
It reminded me of when I was small and played in the sand with my Gramma Tala.

TAG: Moana_005_f
How did they wind up in that cave?

TAG: Moana_006_f
Well... one day, I asked you if you wanted to play, and it was like you couldn't hear me. As if you were very far away.

TAG: Moana_007_f
... That wasn't you anymore, was it? It was the Forgotten...

TAG: Moana_008_f
They threw these toys away in the cave and ran off. I was... confused, and pretty sad. It wasn't like you to do something like that.

TAG: Moana_009_f
Maybe not. But the Forgotten is a part of me. That kid who played on the Beach with you... that part of me is in there somewhere.

TAG: Moana_011_f
Imagine you're wayfinding through that fog... and there's a light on the other side.

TAG: Moana_012_f
It's your memory of all the adventures we've gone on since you've been back in the Village.

TAG: Moana_013_f
Just think about everything we've gone through together and all the memories you've recovered so far.

TAG: Moana_014_f
My memories are starting to return... but there's still some fog over them.
