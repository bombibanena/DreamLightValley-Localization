Way to go, {PlayerName}!

That was some smart thinking: tricking Jafar so he imagined himself as a genie with a lamp!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Spark is safe!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I learned how to use my imagination from the best, Mickey.

Let's just hope he's trapped in there...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
It sure is!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
But, uh... we've still got one problem: I'm stuck like this!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Maybe the Spark can help!

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Gosh, I hope so. Go ahead and <Lore>pick up the lamp</Lore>...

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Then let's <Lore>grab the Spark</Lore> and get outta here!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Aw, thanks, pal. We make a pretty great team.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Well, from what I know of genie lamps, he's not gettin' out until somebody lets him out.
