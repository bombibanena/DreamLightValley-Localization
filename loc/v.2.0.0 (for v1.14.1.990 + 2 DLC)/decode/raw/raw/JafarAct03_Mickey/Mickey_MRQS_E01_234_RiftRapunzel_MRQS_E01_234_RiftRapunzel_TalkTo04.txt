Gosh, I'm glad to see ya, pal. Don't suppose you've figured out how to fix whatever's goin' on with me, have ya?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
I'm working on it right now! I just need one thing from you.

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Of course. Just name it!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
What's your heart's deepest wish?

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Wow... heh... You sure do ask some interesting questions, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
But if it'll help, I'll tell ya.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
I guess my deepest wish is just... for me and all my friends to be happy and together.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Life's most fun when it's like one big picnic with your pals, don't ya think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Agreed!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not big on picnics. I'd wish for a bazillion Star Coins.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Gee, I hope that helped.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Then ya better wish for a never-ending Scrooge's General Store to use it all in, huh?
