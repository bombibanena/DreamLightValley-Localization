Why don't we make a whole <ActivityItem>Hot Dog Cart</ActivityItem>? I'll start drawin' up some plans. Could ya go find the materials we'll need?

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Sounds good to me! But what should we make it out of?

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Oh, I'm sure there's some stuff right here on the Isle.

TAG: Mickey_012_f
You're right. Maybe I'll start with some <ActivityItem>Brass and Bronze Ingots</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
How are we supposed to close it?

Merlin said we need to use the power of our imaginations.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
It sounds like you and I will have to make something creative and toss it inside.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
But what should we make?

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Gosh, that's a good question... *tummy rumble*

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Heh. Guess I forgot to eat breakfast. I could really go for a hot dog about now...

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Say, cooking is pretty creative, right? Why don't we make some hot dogs and toss those in?

TAG: Mickey_008_f
No, wait! If it's all about imagination, then we need to think bigger!
