Welp, here we are.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
What do we do now?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
We have to toss the <ActivityItem>Hot Dog Cart</ActivityItem> into the rift!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Gosh, really? After all we did to make it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sacrifices must be made.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I know. I'm sorry, Mickey...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We can make another Hot Dog Cart later. Toss it in!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Well, pal, if it'll help save Eternity Isle... I'll do it.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Whoa. Did ya see that?

TAG: Mickey_006_f
As soon as I tossed the Hot Dog Cart in, the rift disappeared!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Hot dog! It worked!
