Mickey...? Is that you...?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
{PlayerName}? Yep, it's me.

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Gosh, am I glad to see you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm glad to see you, too!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How did you end up here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't mean to alarm you but... you're completely black and white now!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
I wasn't expecting to see a friend after I stepped through that portal. What happened?

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Remember how I kept flickerin' all black and white? And the world around me was flickerin' too?

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Welp, not too long ago, I blinked and when I opened my eyes... I was here. And now I can't get home!

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Wait â hold on a minute... You're all black and white too!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's something about this island.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's a new look I'm trying out.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's so weird!!!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Yeah, it's almost like this place is stuck in the past.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Mickey, we need to get out of here. Jafar is trying to take over all of Eternity Isle.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
There has to be some way to <Lore>pass through this place and reach Jafar's throne room</Lore> so we can stop him.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
You're right, {PlayerName}. Hey, maybe there's something around here we can use to help us?

TAG: Mickey_011_f
I did see something that looked like <Lore>an old-timey projector</Lore> lying over there...

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Well, you DO look pretty spiffy.

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Though, just speaking for myself, I don't wanna look like this forever. This place... it's almost like it's stuck in the past.

TAG: Mickey_014_f
That's for sure.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Speaking for myself, I don't wanna look like this forever. This place... it's almost like it's stuck in the past.

TAG: Mickey_016_f
Heh. It's a pretty strange story.

TAG: Mickey_017_f
I know. Ever since I got here, I've been stuck like this.
