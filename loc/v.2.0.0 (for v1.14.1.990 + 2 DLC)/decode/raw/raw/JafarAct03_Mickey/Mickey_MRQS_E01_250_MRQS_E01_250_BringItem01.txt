Hey, it IS an old <ActivityItem>Film Projector</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Mickey_001_f
You're right!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Huh... I think it's the projector I helped EVE and WALLÂ·E make! How'd that get here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
There's gotta be some way it can help us.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What good is this thing? It seems pretty useless...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess if we can't stop Jafar, we can at least watch some movies.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Hmm... Let's think...

TAG: Mickey_010_f
But how do we get up to it?

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Welp, I noticed a lot of other junk lyin' around the island that we might be able to use.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great idea! We can build something!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We need more than junk to reach that hole in the sky.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Say... have ya tried turnin' it on?

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Guess I'll just press this button here...

TAG: Mickey_006_f
WHOA! Did ya see that, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Mickey_007_f
The projector punched a hole in the sky!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
And look what's on the other side!

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Jafar's throne room!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
I like your thinkin'!

TAG: Mickey_013_f
All we gotta do is set our minds to it and we can do anything, if we work together!

TAG: Mickey_014_f
I'll <Lore>search the island</Lore>. Let me know if you spot anything.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Hey, ya never know. This old projector looked like junk, right? And look what it did!

TAG: Mickey_016_f
Aw, we can't give up. There's gotta be some way it can help us.

TAG: Mickey_017_f
Gee, I'd love to have a movie night with ya, pal, but how 'bout we do that AFTER we get outta here?
