This is so weird... all of these things... they're <Lore>the things I made with you, Gaston, and Rapunzel</Lore>!

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Huh. That is weird.

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Wait... What did Merlin say about the Spark's magic bein' all about imagination?

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Maybe that's the key to gettin' out of here!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
That's the key to it all. That's how we'll beat Jafar.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
It's not about being stronger or smarter or more cunning or any of those things. It's about...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...unleashing our creativity!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...using our imaginations to help each other.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...sharing the things we create.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
It seems like the only thing Jafar can use his imagination for is thinking of ways to get power for himself...

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Maybe THAT'S why he can't use the magic of the Spark!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Well, then let's put our heads together and get creative! What do ya think we could use all this to build?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A very, very tall ladder?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Some sorta flying machine?

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Gosh, even if we had enough stuff to build a ladder that tall, I don't think it would be very safe to climb.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
All right then... How about a flying machine?

TAG: Mickey_011_f
<Lore>A flying machine</Lore>? That's a great idea!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
We could sit inside <Lore>Gaston's ship</Lore>...

TAG: Mickey_013_f
...attach <Lore>Rapunzel's lanterns</Lore> to the top and use 'em like a hot air balloon...

TAG: Mickey_014_f
...and use my <Lore>Hot Dog Cart</Lore> for the heat to power the balloon!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sounds plain crazy. Let's hope this works.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm not flying in something like that!!!

TAG: Mickey_017_f
Aw shucks, thanks! Just goes to show what ya can do with a little imagination.

TAG: Mickey_018_f
Welp, looks like we got our work cut out for us riggin' it up. Let's get to it!

TAG: Mickey_019_f
I'm sure it'll hold together, as long as we use our imaginations. Heh!

TAG: Mickey_020_f
Gosh, {PlayerName}, I don't know what else we can do.

TAG: Mickey_021_f
*sigh* You're right. We'll just have to hold on tight and hope for the best.
