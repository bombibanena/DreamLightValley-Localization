Oh, uh... Hiya, pal.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
I'm afraid I'm not feeling too good...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Mickey! You're turning black and white!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Now all you're missing is a steamboat.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm going to do everything I can to help you.

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Yep. And gosh was that a surprise when I looked in the mirror.

TAG: Mickey_011_f
But that must mean... that other world you're seeing...

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Could it be the past... or somewhere between the now and the then?

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Good question. Do ya think you can get this all figured out...

TAG: Mickey_014_f
...before I wind up stuck in that black and white world forever?

TAG: Mickey_003_f
There has to be some way to fix this. How did it all start?

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Ya know, it was the strangest thing. I just woke up like this.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
But that's not all... When I flicker, it's not just me flickering. It's the whole Island!

TAG: Mickey_006_f
It's like I'm seein' <Lore>some other world</Lore>.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
And... and I think I'm startin' to get sucked into it!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Merlin thinks that you're caught between the past and the present.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Huh... I guess that makes sense.

TAG: Mickey_016_f
Heh. You're right. I haven't thought about that in a long time.

TAG: Mickey_017_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I'd sure appreciate it.
