I'm so surprised that my gift didn't make Mother Gothel happy.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
I thought you were going to give her the flowers and Scar the salmon. I think things got a little mixed up.

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Yeah. Making everybody in the Village happy is gonna be harder than I thought.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We have to keep trying.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe we should give up.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
You're right!

TAG: Olaf_004_f
And we'll start by delivering this bouquet to Scar!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sure he'll love it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't know if Scar will like that much.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Uhhh...

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Me too!

TAG: Olaf_006_f
These flowers definitely say "king of the jungle" to me. Or at least "jealous uncle of the king of the jungle."

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Why don't I bring Scar the flowers? He can be a little... grumpy.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Okay. But be sure to tell him they're from someone who wants to make him smile!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Er... sure. I'll meet you near the bridge on the Sunlit Plateau after.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Really?

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Don't worry. I'm sure Scar will love it.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Give up? Don't be silly. We just have to keep trying!
