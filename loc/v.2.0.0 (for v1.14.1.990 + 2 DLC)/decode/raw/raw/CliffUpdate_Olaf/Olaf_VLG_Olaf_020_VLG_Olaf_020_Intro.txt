{PlayerName}, just who I was hoping to see! How would you like to help me tell a tale that's sure to dazzle all the Villagers?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course! What can I do to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not now. Kinda busy.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Well, I've been searching everywhere for a great story to tell.

TAG: Olaf_002_f
First I talked to a very friendly squirrel... then I talked to WALLÂ·E... then I talked to Merlin...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What did the squirrel tell you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What did WALLÂ·E tell you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What did Merlin tell you?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Oh, it made a loud screeching noise and ran away.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Though I'm not sure how that story will play with our audience...

TAG: Olaf_005_f
He said, "Whoa!"

TAG: Olaf_006_f
He's a machine of few words...

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Well, Merlin always knows the best stories! Probably because he's magical and also the most aged person I know.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
He told me all about how you're fighting the Forgetting, and I decided... that's our story!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
The Legend of {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_002_f
You want to put on a play all about me?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Good idea. I'm pretty great.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That should work, I guess.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
But I'm... boring.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Phew! I thought for a second there you wouldn't want the sudden fame that's sure to come with being the subject of our epic tale.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Okay, I'm listening, {PlayerName}. Please regale me with your feats of heroism. Spare no details.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Well, okay. It all started when I fell asleep under a tree andâ

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Wait, wait! We can't have story time without a snack.

TAG: Olaf_014_f
A snack? What are you hungry for?

TAG: Olaf_015_f
Oh, being a snowman, I don't need to eat. I'm just thinking of you.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
Maybe you could ask Remy. He knows all about yummy food. I bet he'd know the perfect snack for story time.

TAG: Olaf_017_f
Whoa... You're not just heroic, you're also humble. Now that's the kind of protagonist a great story needs.

TAG: Olaf_018_f
I understand. Creativity happens on its own schedule.
