I've been thinking, {PlayerName}. WALLÂ·E and I have a lot in common. Do you agree?

TAG: Player_000_f
I guess you do. After all...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...you're both curious about new things.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...you're both kind of tiny.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...you both make a lot of interesting noises.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
That's true and very insightful. Oh, and don't forget...

TAG: Olaf_002_f
...we were both brought to life by magic.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
WALLÂ·E's not magic. He's a robot.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I guess that's kind of true...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Does being so similar make you friends?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
But isn't technology really a kind of magic, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Olaf_004_f
I'm glad you agree.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Well, it does help to have things in common.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
But I think what makes us friends is that we're friends!

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Yes, but I'm slightly taller.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
My stick hair gives me a bit of a height advantage. Oh, don't forget...

TAG: Olaf_009_f
That's true. Though I do know more words. Oh, and don't forget...
