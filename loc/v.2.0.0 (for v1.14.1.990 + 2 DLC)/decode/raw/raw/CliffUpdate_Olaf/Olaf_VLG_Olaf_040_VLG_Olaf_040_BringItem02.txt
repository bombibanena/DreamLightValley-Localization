Umm... {PlayerName}, why are you bringing the <ActivityItem>Donald Duck Mask</ActivityItem> to me? Anna's the one who'll wear it.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
It doesn't fit Anna. She can't see out of it. We'll need to find someone else to play the role...

TAG: Olaf_002_f
*gasp* Oh no! The show will be ruined!

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Villagers are already buying their tickets and starting to gather.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
*sniff* Deep breath in... and out... Okay, who else could play Donald Duck?

TAG: Olaf_005_f
We need someone who's brave and plucky and leaps into danger without a thought for themselves and... and...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Um... {PlayerName}... would you try on this <ActivityItem>Donald Duck Mask</ActivityItem>...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I was waiting for you to ask. I'd be the perfect star.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh no. No way. Please no. I can't.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
*sigh* If you need me to, I'll do it.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
See? You've already got Donald's spirit.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
I see one big problem. I don't know the lines.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Oh, that's okay. You can just make it up. The most important thing is embodying the character.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Here, put the <ActivityItem>Donald Duck Mask</ActivityItem> on and let's rehearse.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Please, {PlayerName}! You're the only one who can step in and save the show.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Hooray!
