Mmm, {PlayerName}. That smells delicious!

Now, everything's ready for you to tell your story. Regale me...

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Okay. So it all started when I fell asleep under a tree in the woods...

TAG: Olaf_003_f
...and that's it. That's everything that's happened to me since I arrived in Dreamlight Valley.

That's one of the top three best stories I've ever heard, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Aw shucks. It was nothing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f

My favorite part was when you jumped into the portal to go find Donald Duck.

The Valley has so many heroes!

And if I'm going to write their story, I need to know every tiny, little detail.

What happened on Kristoff and Donald's epic adventure? How did Kristoff survive in the woods the whole time Donald was missing?

TAG: Olaf_010_f
I must... know... everything!

TAG: Olaf_011_f
I guess we could go talk to Kristoff and Donald and ask them.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Great idea! Why don't you do that while I start to figure out the first act of the script?

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Ahem. "Act One, Scene One. It was a night of vicious storms..." Wait. No. You said it was sunny...
