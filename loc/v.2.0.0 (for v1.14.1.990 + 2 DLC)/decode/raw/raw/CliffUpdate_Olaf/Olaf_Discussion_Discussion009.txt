Hello, {PlayerName}. I thought today I would sunbathe on Dazzle Beach.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That sounds fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you sure that's a good idea?

Can snow get a tan?

TAG: Olaf_001_f
I've always wanted to try it.

Anna says sunbathing isn't something people do a lot of in Arendelle.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Question, though: How does one sunbathe?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You just sit in the sun.

It's important to have sunscreen.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You need a hat.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Really? Well, I can do that!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
I wonder if that's like my friend Oaken's sun balm. I'll have to find some!

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Really? I love hats! And I love doing things that need hats!

Of course! Elsa's magic permafrost keeps me safe and cool.

I don't know! But I can't wait to find out!
