{PlayerName}! I am in need of your wisdom.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
What's up?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
I want to make a new friend.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
And you have the most friends of anyone I know, so you must be an expert.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
I was thinking maybe one of the rabbits in the Peaceful Meadow...

TAG: Player_000_f
If you want to make friends with a rabbit in the Meadow, just make sure to...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...run around with them. They like to play.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...feed them carrots. They love carrots.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...check back every day to see if the rabbit is around.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
They like to play? *gasp* I like to play! We'll be a perfect match.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Thank you for sharing your wisdom, friend.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Great! I'll borrow a carrot from Kristoff!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
... And I'll be sure to keep my nose away from them.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
It might take a few visits before they really start to trust you.

Oh, the rabbits are shy. I understand.
