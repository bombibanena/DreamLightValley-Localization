Wow. Did you see that?!

TAG: Olaf_001_f
I must have interrupted the Forgotten while they were casting some sort of magical enchantment.

TAG: Olaf_002_f
And the Orb made the magic go wild in here.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
That must have been the flash I saw!

TAG: Player_000_f
So this chamber... it must be the Forgotten's. And it was the Forgotten who locked you inside here!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm so sorry that happened, Olaf.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I hope you learned a lesson about barging into secret chambers.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
That's okay. I know you wouldn't have wanted it to happen.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
They're all about magic, casting spells, making things float, <Lore>how to open portals</Lore>...

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Did you just say "how to open portals"?

TAG: Olaf_014_f
*gasp* How to open portals? Yes! And we need to open a portal!

TAG: Olaf_015_f
I guess I'll need to <Lore>find that book</Lore>.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
After that, the Forgotten grabbed the Orb off the floor and threw it into that portal over there.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
With my arms still attached.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Oh, but bright side! Now we know where the Orb is. Someone with arms can just reach inside the portal and grab it.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
I'd volunteer to do it myself but... ahem, no arms.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
That portal keeps flickering. Something's wrong with it. I don't think it's safe to reach inside.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Hmm... Oh! Maybe there's a way to fix it in one of these books.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Since my arms are missing, I couldn't turn the pages to read them. But the titles are very interesting.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
Oh, I've learned many lessons, including that it's a great way to find new hiding spots.
