Merlin is so smart! And he told me that he's a wizard.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Do you think that one day I could be a wizard?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I don't know if snowmen can be wizards.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're already magical.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You could ask Merlin to teach you?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
True. Maybe I should ask Merlin. But...

Yesterday, when I asked him my two-hundredth question, he said I should try doing my own research. And then he mumbled something about too many questions and turning into an encyclopedia.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Do you think I could turn into an actual encyclopedia if I ask too many questions?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Absolutely.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think you misunderstood Merlin...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
*gasp* You're turning into a book right now!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Then I'll have to be careful. I really like books, especially encyclopedias...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
...but I prefer being a snowman.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
You might be right. I'll go ask him a question about it!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
AM I? Where? Oh no! I just asked two more questions!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
I'd better be quiet and hope I get less paper-y.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
True. But that's not the same as being a wizard.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Maybe I should ask Merlin. But...

TAG: Olaf_012_f
I could, but...
