Wow, {PlayerName}. You found my missing pieces, AND stopped the blizzard. You're very talented.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
There are still a lot of questions left, though. Like what was the deal with that secret chamber?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
What was the Forgotten doing in there...?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Don't worry, {PlayerName}. I know you'll figure it out. You're practically the Official Village Figurer Outer.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
And I'll be here if you need any warm hugs or words of sage wisdom from a snowman wise beyond his years.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
But for now, I'm going to go see what's changed in the Village while I was winning at hide-and-seek.

TAG: Player_000_f
I think you're going to love it, Olaf.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
There are so many new fun facts to learn.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
There are lots of new Villagers to befriend.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There are lots of critters to play games with.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Ooo, I haven't learned a new fact in soooo long.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Thank you for finding me, {PlayerName}. You're the best seeker a hider could have.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Oh, and one more thing...

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Tag! You're "it"!

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Really?! Well, I can't wait to meet them all.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
That's wonderful! Though, I hope they like games that aren't "Keep-Away with Olaf's Nose." I just got my nose back, and I'd really like to keep it for a while.
