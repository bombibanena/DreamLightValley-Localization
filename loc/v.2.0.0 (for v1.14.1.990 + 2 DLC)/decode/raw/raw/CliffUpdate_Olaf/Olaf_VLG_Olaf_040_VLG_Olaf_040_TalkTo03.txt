Donald Duck...? Is that you...?!

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Hee-hee-hee, I'm just kidding, {PlayerName}! I know it's you under there. But you look wonderful!

TAG: Olaf_002_f
From a few feet away, someone could really mistake you for the actual Donald Duck.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I agree.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uh... I doubt it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I look nothing like Donald!!! I can hardly see in this thing!!!

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Okay, let's rehearse...

TAG: Olaf_004_f
<Lore>"Aha! It is I, the courageous woodsman and ice deliverer, Kristoff."</Lore>

TAG: Player_001_f
Uh... <Lore>"And I'm... I'm..."</Lore>

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
"...the valiant hero, Donald Duck!"

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
"...the dashing, debonair Donald Duck!"

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
"...Ronald Ruck?"

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Psst. Great job so far, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
<Lore>"Together, my feathered friend and I are on a quest to stop the Forgetting and restore the Valley!"</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_007_f
<Lore>"*gasp* Who's that over there?"</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_008_f
<Lore>"It's some sort of Dark Entity stealing the Orb of Courage!"</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Psst. It's time for your big line, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
"Aw phooey!"

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
"To infinity and beyond!"

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
"WALLÂ·E!"

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Perfect! It's like you're guided by the spirit of Donald Duck himself!

TAG: Olaf_011_f
<Lore>"Quick! The Dark Entity is escaping through that mysterious portal!"</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Psst. Okay, {PlayerName}, it's time for your big stunt! Leap into the air like you're jumping through a portal into a dark, mysterious world!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Don't worry. I'll nail this part.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
*gulp* ... Here goes nothing...

TAG: Olaf_013_f
<Lore>"I'll stop you, you vile villain!"</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Perfect! That stunt was very convincing.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
As for your performance overall...

TAG: Olaf_016_f
It was amazing! This is the role you were born to play.

TAG: Olaf_017_f
Now all we need to do is set up the stage in the Frosted Heights, so we can put on the play.

TAG: Olaf_018_f
You've made some very bold choices that are sure to be divisive with the audience. But I liked them!

TAG: Olaf_019_f
<Lore>"I'll stop you, you... youâ"</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_020_f
Agh! Whoops!

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Okay, that was... well, I guess stunts aren't your strong suit as a performer.

TAG: Olaf_022_f
Um... I think that's more of a Buzz Lightyear thing to say, but I like that you're experimenting.

TAG: Olaf_023_f
Um... I think that's more of a WALLÂ·E thing to say, but I like that you're experimenting.

TAG: Olaf_024_f
Psst. You're making some interesting choices, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Olaf_025_f
Ooh, try to work that frustration into your performance.
