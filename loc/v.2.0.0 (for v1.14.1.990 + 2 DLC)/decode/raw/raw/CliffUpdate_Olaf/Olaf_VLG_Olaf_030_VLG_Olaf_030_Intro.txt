Hi, {PlayerName}! So, good news... we're almost ready to put on the play. But I'll need your help first.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure! I'd love to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't right now.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
That's wonderful! Because Donald and I have finished the script.

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Great! Can I read it?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Oh no. Not yet.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
... Why?

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Well, we have it all written in our minds...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
...but we haven't written any of it down.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Don't worry. That part's not too hard.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What?! Writing it down is the most important part!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Uh oh. We better get to work.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
I didn't want to interrupt our creative flow by going to find ink...

TAG: Olaf_008_f
...and I don't have anything to write it down on either.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
No problem. I'll get some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> so we can whip up some paper.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
And I'll find some <ActivityItem>Purple Marsh Milk Weed</ActivityItem> and an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem> to make you some ink.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Fabulous! As soon as you have all that, bring it to Donald. He's going to write the story down.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're not going to write it yourself?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Okay, sounds great!

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Not this time. I have to focus on the ENTIRE production.

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Oh, and one last thing! Could you ask Donald if he'll star as himself in the play? Thanks!

TAG: Olaf_014_f
I understand. Creativity really does need to happen on its own time.
