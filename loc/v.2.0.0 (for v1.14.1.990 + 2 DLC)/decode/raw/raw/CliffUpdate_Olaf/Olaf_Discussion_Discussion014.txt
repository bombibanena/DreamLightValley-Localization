Hi, {PlayerName}. I spent the whole morning collecting all the sticks lying around the Peaceful Meadow.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
So I am now the owner of an abundance of sticks!

TAG: Olaf_002_f
How many sticks do you have, Olaf...?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
One hundred and thirty-eight.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
What do you think I should do with them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Make some chairs.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Give yourself a hundred and thirty-eight arms.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You collected all those sticks for no reason?

TAG: Olaf_005_f
What a wonderful idea! I'll get Kristoff to help me make them into chairs.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Then everyone in the Village will be able to sit down whenever they want!

TAG: Olaf_007_f
But where would they...

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Oh! Hee-hee-hee! You are so funny, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
No...

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Collecting them was fun, and fun is one of my favorite reasons!
