{PlayerName}! I see you've managed to mend the rift in time around the palace.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Hmm... I suppose that means Jafar's free...

TAG: Player_000_f
Not quite.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think he's locked in the palace.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It was all part of a bigger scheme.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's kind of a jerk!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Locked in the...? What do you mean?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
But where do we start?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe something like that should stay lost...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Just think of what I could do if I got ahold of that...

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Jafar tried to take the Hourglass from me. But Rapunzel, Gaston, and EVE didn't like that. EVE almost gave Jafar a taste of her laser cannon.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Jafar vanished. I can only guess he's hiding in the palace â it's kind of his fortress. But before that...

TAG: Merlin_017_f
...he said he's <Lore>after something called the Spark of Imagination</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
The Spark of Imagination? Why, I've never heard of it.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Jafar said that it was somewhere <Lore>beneath this island</Lore>, and that only someone with the Hourglass can find it...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Oh! And he also said that it would give him the power to control all of space and time!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
... Control all of space and time?! Then we've no choice but to stop him!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Whatever this "Spark of Imagination" is, we must find it before Jafar does!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Where so many good adventures start. With a trip to the Library!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
I must do some research. This may take quite a while. In the meantime...

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Keep uncovering the secrets of Eternity Isle, and do whatever you can to make it feel like home.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Now then, I wonder if <Lore>the Spark of Imagination might be connected to the magic of the Realms</Lore>...

TAG: Merlin_022_f
You ought to try <Lore>venturing to one of the Realms and using your Hourglass to search there</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Why, there's no telling what you might find... or what you could create from it!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
No secret can stay buried forever. If we don't find it, I fear Jafar will.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
You shouldn't be too eager to wield power like that. You'll find it can be a great burden to use it wisely.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Well, that's no surprise. Tell me... what sort of scheme?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
My friend, he is much more than a "jerk." But what drew you to that conclusion?
