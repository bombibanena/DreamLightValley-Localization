Now then, beyond this gate, you'll discover places that will change everything you know about Dreamlight Valley.

Oh, where did I put that key...? Hmm...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe it's in your Library?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you check your pockets?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's always in the last place you look.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I hope not. There are more than 72 ways to catalogue a key. It could take weeks to find it!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Ah-ha! I've got it! It was sewn into a tiny pocket near my elbow!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I hope it's the right one...

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Eureka! It worked!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Well, what are you waiting for? <Lore>Step through the gate and find out what's on the other side</Lore>. I wouldn't dare spoil the surprise.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Right. Right. This could take some time. I have many pockets... and countless things in each of them...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Well, of course it is. Why would you keep searching once you'd found it?
