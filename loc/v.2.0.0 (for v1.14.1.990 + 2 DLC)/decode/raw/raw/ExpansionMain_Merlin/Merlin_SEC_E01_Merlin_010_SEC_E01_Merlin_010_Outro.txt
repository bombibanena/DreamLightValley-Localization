Ah-ha! You've done it!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
You're constructing with your Hourglass and the Timebending Tables. Well done, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
I'd say, it's almost as if you're rediscovering the past with each thing you build. Exciting, eh?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Like I'm doing archaeology with magic!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Like discovering potato chips under the couch cushions... but for lost treasures!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Precisely!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Oh, and there's something else that I've uncovered... The Mist in your Hourglass isn't just useful for <Lore>fixing the Time Rifts</Lore> around the Isle.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
You can <Lore>also use the Mist to make your Hourglass more powerful</Lore>!

TAG: Merlin_018_f
I'm sure if you do, you'll uncover additional things to create.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
But to understand it all... well, more research is required. I'll let you know if I discover anything else.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Er, that's not quite how I would have phrased it, but I suppose the metaphor is apt.
