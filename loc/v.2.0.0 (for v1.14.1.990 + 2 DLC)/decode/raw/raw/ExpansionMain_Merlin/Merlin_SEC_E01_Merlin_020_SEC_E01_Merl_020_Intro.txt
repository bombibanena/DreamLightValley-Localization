{PlayerName}, I presume you've noticed the strange debris littered all over Eternity Isle...

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Some sort of <Lore>ancient rubble</Lore> strewn about Ancient's Landing.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
...<Lore>stalagmites made of glass</Lore> in the Glittering Dunes...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
...and <Lore>malicious plants</Lore> sprouting all over the Wild Tangle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're blocking me from decorating!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're stopping me from reaching places I want to explore!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They sure are ugly.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Yes, yes... You know, it's curious. Your Royal Tools should remove the debris...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
...but it appears that the magic of Eternity Isle has seeped into them. They're <Lore>frozen in time</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
To destroy them, <Lore>you'll need the magic of the Hourglass and the Timebending Table</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Examine the echoes from the past on your Timebending Table. There must be some way for you to <Lore>make potions to infuse your Royal Tools with the magic you need</Lore>.
