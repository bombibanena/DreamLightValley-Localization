{PlayerName}, you've a curious spring in your step and a twinkle in your eye... What's going on?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm helping Merida throw a party!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I have some business for you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hey... You're Scottish, right?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
A party, you say? What kind of party?

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Merida's throwing a proper Scottish Festival. I was hoping you'd have supplies and could have some <ActivityItem>Clan DunBroch Banners</ActivityItem> made that we can decorate with?

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
A proper Scottish Festival? Hee-hee! Now that's the best news I've heard in quite a while! Tell ya what, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
...I'll donate the supplies IF you put up some <ActivityItem>Clan McDuck Banners</ActivityItem> as well.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The more the merrier!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not sure that's Merida's vision...

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
That's the spirit! Take these and fair winds to ya!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Not her VISION?

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
The vision of any proper Scottish Festival is: Paint the town plaid!

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Just take these <Lore>supplies</Lore>... I'll talk to Merida.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
You always know how to get my attention. And what business would that be?

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
{PlaceHolder}Player wants some chairs to throw a real Scottish Banquet. Scrooge is ecstatic. He kept them at the ready for so long, waiting for such an event.<lw>On the theme of decoration, they disagree: Player wants Clan DunBroch banners to decorate.<lw>Scrooge agrees, though not after trying to pass some Clan McDuck banners as well.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Sparkle me spats!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Of COURSE I'm Scottish! I'm as Scottish as the Highlands! The waters of Loch Ness! ... Wait â why do ya ask?
