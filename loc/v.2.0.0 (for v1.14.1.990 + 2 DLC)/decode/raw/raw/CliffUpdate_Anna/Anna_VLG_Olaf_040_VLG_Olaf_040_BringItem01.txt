Ooh, looks like you've got everything we need to make the <ActivityItem>Donald Duck Mask</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Anna_008_f
Could you break the bad news to him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No worries, Anna. I'll let him know.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh great. Make me the one to break the little snowman's heart.

TAG: Anna_001_f
I'll put it all together...

TAG: Anna_002_f
Uh oh...

TAG: Anna_003_f
What's wrong?

TAG: Anna_004_f
The mask... I built it exactly to Olaf's specifications, but it doesn't fit me very well.

TAG: Anna_005_f
I can't see out of the eye holes... and the feathers keep poking me...

TAG: Anna_006_f
I'm sorry, {PlayerName}. I don't think I'm going to be able to wear this.

TAG: Anna_007_f
Olaf will have to find someone else to play Donald Duck if he wants them to wear this costume...

TAG: Anna_009_f
I'm really sorry...

TAG: Anna_010_f
But I'm sure there's someone else here whom this mask would fit perfectly.

TAG: Anna_011_f
Here it is.
