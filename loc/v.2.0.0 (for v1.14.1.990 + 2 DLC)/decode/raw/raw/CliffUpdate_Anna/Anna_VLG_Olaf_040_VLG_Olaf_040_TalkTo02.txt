Oh, you're here. Thank goodness!

I've been so busy dealing with the rest of the costumes that I haven't had time to make the <ActivityItem>Donald Duck Mask</ActivityItem> yet.

TAG: Anna_002_f
Olaf is really specific about what he wants it to look like...

TAG: Anna_003_f
It sounds a little strange to me, but who am I to question his artistic vision?

TAG: Anna_004_f
We'll need some <ActivityItem>Fiber</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Anna_005_f
...oh, and some of <ActivityItem>Donald's Feathers</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He must have left some lying around...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I guess I could just pluck a few off of him.

TAG: Anna_006_f
Hopefully! I'm always finding feathers when I go for walks. I guess everybody sheds. You should see my hairbrush!

TAG: Anna_007_f
Hey, maybe there are some feathers in his House.

TAG: Anna_008_f
Okay. I'll come talk to you once I've got everything.

TAG: Anna_009_f
Uh... please don't do that. Let me think... Well, if you were looking for strands of my hair, you'd check my hairbrush...
