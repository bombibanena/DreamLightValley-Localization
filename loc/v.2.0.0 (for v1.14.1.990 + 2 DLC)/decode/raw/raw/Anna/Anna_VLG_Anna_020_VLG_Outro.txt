I'm sad that Kristoff doesn't remember everything yet.

TAG: Anna_001_f
But he remembers climbing the mountains with me, so I think we're on the right track.

I'm going to talk to Merlin. Maybe he can help bring back the rest of Kristoff's memories.

If magic took Kristoff's memories away, maybe that's what it'll take to restore it.

Thanks for your help, {PlayerName}. I'll let you know if Merlin has any ideas.
