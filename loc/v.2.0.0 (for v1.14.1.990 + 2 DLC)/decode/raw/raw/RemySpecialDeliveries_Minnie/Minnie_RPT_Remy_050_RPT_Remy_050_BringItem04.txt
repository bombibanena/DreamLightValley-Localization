Oh! These look delicious, {PlayerName}. Are they for me?

TAG: Minnie_001_f
Thank you!

TAG: Minnie_002_f
These aren't from me. Somebody else asked me to deliver them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But I can't say who.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It was a very nice lady. Guess who?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
It was the Fairy Godmother.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Someone asked you to bring me these... What a mystery...

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Now, who would be so thoughtful, knows I like mysteries... and works with dreams... Oh!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
It must be the Fairy Godmother!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How did you guess?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Uh... no.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
The Fairy Godmother is always so kind. She only thinks of everyone else.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
She must let someone do something nice for her for a change.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
Oh, I know! I just made a few batches of my <ActivityItem>Gingerbread Cookies</ActivityItem>. Here.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
Please give them to the Fairy Godmother. And be sure NOT to tell her that they came from me.

TAG: Minnie_015_f
Oh, and try not to eat them on the way! *giggle*

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Oh, {PlayerName}. I hope I don't offend you by saying you're not very good at fibbing.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
The Fairy Godmother sent these?

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Whoops. I wasn't supposed to tell you.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
*giggle* Don't worry; your secret is safe with me.
