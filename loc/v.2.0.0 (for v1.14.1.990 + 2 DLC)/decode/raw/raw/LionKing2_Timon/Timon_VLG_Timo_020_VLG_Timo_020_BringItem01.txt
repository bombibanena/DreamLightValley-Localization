Here's the <ActivityItem>Recording Device</ActivityItem>, all fixed up and ready to go!

TAG: Timon_023_f
Great! A-A-HEM...

TAG: Timon_027_f
"In the distance, a wild beast sits, nibbling on the grass. She waits for her colony to join her. Let's watch."

TAG: Timon_029_f
... What are you talking about?

TAG: Timon_030_f
I'm just gettin' warmed up.

TAG: Timon_001_f
Now... what exactly do we do with this recording thingamajigger?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We can use it to record your voice!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Don't worry about it; I'll handle the recording.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
"Thingamajigger"? Really?

TAG: Timon_004_f
You can talk about the critters we're taking pictures of and it will play your voice back to you.

TAG: Timon_007_f
Ya mean, I'll hear myself AFTER I said something? That's amazing!

TAG: Timon_002_f
Let's get started. Do you know what critters you want to see?

TAG: Timon_009_f
Well, you've been here longer than me. Where do you think we should start?

TAG: Timon_010_f
Hmm. I think we should snap a photo of...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...something cute and cuddly.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...a cool reptile.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...one of the furry little omnivores.

TAG: Timon_011_f
Like a squirrel or a rabbit!

TAG: Timon_014_f
But we definitely want to have a variety of pictures. We want to photograph as many critters as we can!

TAG: Timon_015_f
Oh! I know! What about that little red lizard I've seen walkin' around? You know, the one who talks fast.

TAG: Timon_016_f
Lizard? Do you mean Mushu?

TAG: Timon_017_f
Mushu isn't a critter, Timon. Or a lizard. He's a Guardian!

TAG: Timon_018_f
Even better! If he's something special, that would add some pizzazz to this production!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Maybe you're right.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
If you insist...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm not so sure about that.

TAG: Timon_019_f
Of COURSE I'm right! I'm always right!

TAG: Timon_025_f
All right, just so long as you understand he isn't a critter! Mushu is a very well-respected Guardian and should be treated as such.

TAG: Timon_026_f
Yeah, yeah, I got it! Stop worrying so much! This is going to be GREAT.

TAG: Timon_028_f
Okay, I'll go <Lore>take pictures of some critters in Dreamlight Valley... and Mushu.</Lore> While I do that, you can do some more scouting for the documentary.

TAG: Timon_020_f
Trust me; it's a great idea.

TAG: Timon_021_f
What's not to be sure about? Trust me; it's gonna be great.

TAG: Timon_012_f
Like a crocodile or a turtle!

TAG: Timon_013_f
Like a fox or raccoon!

TAG: Timon_005_f
You're the talent here, Timon. I'll handle the technical stuff.

TAG: Timon_008_f
Hey, I'm more than just a pretty face, ya know!

TAG: Timon_006_f
What? We don't have these things in the savanna.
