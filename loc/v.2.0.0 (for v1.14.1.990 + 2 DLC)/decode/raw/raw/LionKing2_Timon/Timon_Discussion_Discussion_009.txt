Me? Pfft! That's easy.

TAG: Timon_001_f
I do what I like, and I don't let anybody tell me any different. No rules. No responsibilities.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You are the best at being worry-free!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You seem a little high-strung at times.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There must be something special you like to do.

TAG: Timon_002_f
Aren't I?

TAG: Timon_005_f
It's a gift, really.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I'm glad you're here to teach us your ways.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
The gift that keeps on giving!

TAG: Timon_013_f
It can be a burden to have all the brains, but I owe it to all the worrywarts to pass on my wisdom.

TAG: Timon_014_f
My very presence is a present! Ha! Get it?

TAG: Timon_003_f
Well sure, if you were prey, you'd be a little high-strung sometimes too!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sorry! You're right; that does sound scary!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Don't worry; you're safe here.

TAG: Timon_004_f
Well, I do love a good bug feast.

TAG: Timon_006_f
Oh, and napping in the shade with a cool breeze blowing through my fur.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That sounds great! Other than the bug-eating, anyway.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I could use a shady spot to nap right now.

TAG: Timon_007_f
Don't knock it 'til ya try it!

TAG: Timon_008_f
It's the best way to recharge for a day of... whatever it is you do around here.
