Hey {PlayerName}, how 'bout some help with a little project I have in mind?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course! How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.

TAG: Timon_001_f
I've been checking out the animals in the Valley. Ya know, the squirrels and such.

TAG: Timon_018_f
We call them critters.

TAG: Timon_019_f
"Critters." I like that. Anyway, I wanna keep track of 'em somehow. It's always good to know your neighbors, right?

TAG: Timon_002_f
Do ya have any ideas?

TAG: Timon_005_f
What if you make sort of a documentary? You can take pictures, record yourself talking about them, and we can make a slideshow for the Village!

TAG: Timon_006_f
Uh-huh, uh-huh, that sounds good... only one problem...

TAG: Timon_007_f
I have NO idea what any of that means!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh, sorry! Let me explain!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What don't you understand?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's pretty self-explanatory...

TAG: Timon_012_f
Please do.

TAG: Timon_008_f
A documentary is used to teach folks about... pretty much anything! Usually they are videos, but we can make a slideshow presentation instead.

TAG: Timon_003_f
And you humans like these?

TAG: Timon_015_f
Yes! They're very interesting, and it's nice to teachâ

TAG: Timon_016_f
So I'm gonna be FAMOUS!

TAG: Timon_017_f
All right, let's do it! I can't wait for my adoring audience to praise my incredible work!

TAG: Timon_011_f
Okay! I bet someone around here would have a recording device that we can borrow.

TAG: Timon_013_f
Buzz might have something. He's always using his communicator. And Mr. McDuck may have also come across something in his shop...

TAG: Timon_014_f
While I go <Lore>talk to Buzz and Scrooge</Lore>, you should scope out the critters and decide which ones you'd want to document!

TAG: Timon_009_f
What's a documentary? Or a slideshow?!

TAG: Timon_010_f
CLEARLY it isn't, since I have no clue what your talking about!

TAG: Timon_004_f
That's fine. Come find me when you have some extra time!
