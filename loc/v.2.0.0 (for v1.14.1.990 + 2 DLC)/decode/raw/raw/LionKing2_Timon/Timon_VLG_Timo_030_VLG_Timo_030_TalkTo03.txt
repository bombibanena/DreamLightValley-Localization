Bad news, Timon. Anna and Elsa didn't really feel like the meals helped them much.

TAG: Timon_002_f
What?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Unbelievable, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe they were just confused.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That advice didn't make much sense.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Are you sure you heard right? That doesn't make any sense!

TAG: Timon_009_f
Maybe Anna and Elsa don't need our help. We should focus our attention elsewhere.

TAG: Timon_010_f
Okay. Fine. We can forget the food. Because I know for a fact the sparkly sky dots were crucial to Simba and his journey.

TAG: Timon_011_f
We need to bring some of those to Moana!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What do you mean by that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's a GREAT idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I don't think that's going to work...

TAG: Timon_012_f
Sheesh! Must I explain everything?!

TAG: Timon_015_f
All you gotta do is <Lore>go to where we met and catch some Fireflies</Lore> that we can bring to Moana.

TAG: Timon_016_f
Okay, I'll do that if you go check on Anna and Elsa... just to make sure those dishes didn't make them sick.

TAG: Timon_013_f
Most of my ideas are great ideas, {PlayerName}. It's why I started Timon Talks!

TAG: Timon_014_f
Trust me, it's guaranteed!

TAG: Timon_006_f
What's confusing? Simba ate the new food, Simba became a king. It's a straight line!

TAG: Timon_007_f
What do you mean?

TAG: Timon_008_f
Simba ate some new food, Simba became a king. It makes perfect sense!
