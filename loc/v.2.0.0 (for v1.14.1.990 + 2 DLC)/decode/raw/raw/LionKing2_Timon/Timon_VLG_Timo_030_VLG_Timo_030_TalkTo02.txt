Ya know, I'm not seeing as much enthusiasm for my talk as I thought I would. Nobody seems more ready to rule.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe everyone is still processing it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It kind of missed the mark.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It was too focused on Simba's journey.

TAG: Timon_003_f
You had a LOT of advice to give. Maybe they just need time to understand your wisdom.

TAG: Timon_006_f
Let me think... Oh, I've got it! They just need some help to apply my lessons to their OWN lives!

TAG: Timon_001_f
Maybe...

TAG: Timon_002_f
And as the Ruler of the Valley, you should take the lead on this!

TAG: Timon_007_f
Start by making some food. Something unique, something no one's ever tried before. Here. I have recipes you can use!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Where did you get these recipes?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How will this help?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I don't know if I should trust this recipe...

TAG: Timon_011_f
Remy gave 'em to me. Though...

TAG: Timon_014_f
I had Vanellope help me make a few tweaks. Put my own little twist on 'em, as it were.

TAG: Timon_015_f
It's going to take an adventurous eater to try meerkat recipes, I think...

TAG: Timon_010_f
I've heard Anna and Elsa are pretty adventurous. They like pickled herring. And trust me, I've smelled some, and it is PUNGENT. I bet they'd be happy to try some new foods and chase a new destiny!

TAG: Timon_008_f
If you say so... Okay, I'll <Lore>cook some of these dishes for Anna and Elsa</Lore>.

TAG: Timon_009_f
It'll be just like when I fed Simba his first grub!

TAG: Timon_012_f
Did you learn NOTHING from my Timon Talk?

TAG: Timon_016_f
New foods help leaders lead! Just like Simba! Keep up, {PlayerName}; we have work to do.

TAG: Timon_017_f
All right, and who am I feeding this... unique recipe to?

TAG: Timon_013_f
Are you doubting my Timon Talk lessons?

TAG: Timon_018_f
I'm just saying the recipe is very... creative. I'm not sure who will be willing to eat this, Timon.

TAG: Timon_004_f
What do ya mean?! It was perfect!

TAG: Timon_005_f
All of your advice was very specifically related to him.
