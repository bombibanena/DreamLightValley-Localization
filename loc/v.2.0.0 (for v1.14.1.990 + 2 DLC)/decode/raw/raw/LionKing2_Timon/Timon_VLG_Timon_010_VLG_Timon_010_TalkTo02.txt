Hey Timon, how are you doing? Do you feel any better about the Valley now?

TAG: Timon_001_f
I most certainly do! I thought about what you said, started mingling with the locals, and met somebody who really helped.

TAG: Timon_002_f
I had a lot of help when I first arrived here, too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Mickey was always so kind.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Goofy was a lot of fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Merlin seemed to know everything!

TAG: Timon_003_f
Understandable. He's definitely got a way of makin' folks feel welcome.

TAG: Timon_007_f
So who did you end up meeting?

TAG: Timon_008_f
Vanellope!

TAG: Timon_009_f
She had some â let's say â inventive ideas to help take care of things.

TAG: Timon_010_f
Wait, what do you mean by that? What did you need to take care of?

TAG: Timon_011_f
Oh, it's just a piffling little â ya know what? Never mind. Nothin' to concern yourself with.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What did you do?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What did Vanellope do?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
This sounds like trouble...

TAG: Timon_012_f
Me? Whoa, now! *I* didn't do anything!

TAG: Timon_015_f
I just pointed out Scar's generally terrifying personality, and Vanellope came up with an idea.

TAG: Timon_017_f
Oh no... what did you two do?

TAG: Timon_018_f
SHE thought maybe we needed a little anti-lion security around here. And I happen to agree.

TAG: Timon_019_f
But what about Simba and Nala?

TAG: Timon_020_f
Oh, it's not for them! She said she'd do somethin' in Scar's Cave to keep the rest of the Valley safe from HIM.

TAG: Timon_021_f
Oof, okay, I need to go <Lore>investigate Scar's Cave</Lore> before something bad happens. You should go find Pumbaa and try not to get into trouble!

TAG: Timon_013_f
Nothing bad! I promise!

TAG: Timon_014_f
HA! Trouble for Scar, maybe!

TAG: Timon_016_f
What do you mean by that?

TAG: Timon_004_f
He cracks me up! What a goof.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Sheesh. I think he's forgotten more than I'll ever know.
