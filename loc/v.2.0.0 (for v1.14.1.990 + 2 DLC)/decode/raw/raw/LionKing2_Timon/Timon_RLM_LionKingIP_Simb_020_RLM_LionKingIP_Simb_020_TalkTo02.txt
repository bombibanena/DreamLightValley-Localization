Well, look at that. You finally got your very own mane! How's it feel, kid?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I feel more relaxed already!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Kinda silly...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Like I wanna roar!

TAG: Timon_001_f
That's great!

TAG: Timon_002_f
Whatever it takes for you to let go of some of that tension.

TAG: Timon_003_f
So... was that it? Did I finish my hakuna matata lessons?

TAG: Timon_004_f
BAH! Hardly. We're just gettin' started. <Lore>Follow me</Lore>!

TAG: Timon_005_f
Hey, being silly can be very relaxing. You can't take yourself too seriously.

TAG: Timon_006_f
Take Simba â he might be king of the Pride Lands, but he's never afraid to have fun.

TAG: Timon_007_f
Well, let's hear it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
*ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!*

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Mew?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Grrrr...

TAG: Timon_008_f
Whoa!

TAG: Timon_009_f
I'm impressed. Almost as powerful as Simba's.

TAG: Timon_010_f
Ha! You sound like Simba when he was a cub.

TAG: Timon_011_f
You should ask him for lessons. He's got a GREAT roar now.

TAG: Timon_012_f
Not quite. You should ask Simba to give you a couple of lessons.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What does that mean exactly? Lessons?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I don't have time for this!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Sounds great!

TAG: Timon_013_f
Let me show you. <Lore>Follow me</Lore>!

TAG: Timon_014_f
Spoken like someone who DESPERATELY needs hakuna matata in their life. <Lore>Follow me</Lore>!

TAG: Timon_015_f
I knew you'd see it our way. Come on; <Lore>follow me</Lore>!
