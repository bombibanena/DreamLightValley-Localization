Hey {PlayerName}, are you all right? You look a little... perturbed? Yeah, I'm gonna go with "perturbed."

There's a bug infestation; we need your help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So many bugs. So gross.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Evil bugs are going to start the Forgetting all OVER AGAIN!

Every meerkat has their day... And today's MY day!

TAG: Timon_004_f
These bugs... Merlin called them "Night Mites." They seem to cause some memory loss, just like the Forgetting.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Well, if you need my help to stop 'em, I'm in!

TAG: Timon_006_f
Great, I already talked to Pumbaa. He's in too!

TAG: Timon_008_f
Terrific! Let's get started!

TAG: Timon_009_f
Let's <Lore>meet in Merlin's library</Lore>.

TAG: Timon_007_f
You talk to Pumbaa. I have to prepare mentally, physically, and energetically for the greatest challenge of my LIFE.

TAG: Timon_001_f
Bugs? Where? I can help; I'm starved!

TAG: Timon_003_f
What are you talkin' about?!
