Everything is set up around Pride Rock. It's a proper jungle now!

TAG: Timon_000_f
That's great, {PlayerName}. Thanks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You don't sound very grateful...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Seriously. It's amazing. I did a GREAT job!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. It's all good. Everything's great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Ah, so you're afraid.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Did someone actually say that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're right; this place IS scary.

TAG: Timon_007_f
Something tells me you're not doing so well, Timon.

TAG: Timon_008_f
Come on; you can talk to me.

TAG: Timon_014_f
All right, all right... maybe â and I mean a BIG maybe â I'm feeling a tiny bit stressed.

TAG: Timon_015_f
Is it Pride Rock? Are you not happy with it?

TAG: Timon_016_f
What? No no no, Pride Rock looks great. Love what you've done with the place. Very jungle chic!

TAG: Timon_017_f
Do you like living here in the Valley?

TAG: Timon_018_f
Absolutely! The landscapes are aesthetically pleasing; I get tons of fresh air... Oh, and I LOVE the predators here...

TAG: Timon_001_f
They just roam around freely with their sharp teeth and glowering faces that scream "I can't wait to eat that meerkat and warthog." It's great.

TAG: Timon_020_f
Of course I'm AFRAID!

TAG: Timon_021_f
There are humongous, carnivorous bad guys prancing around this place like innocent little butterflies!

TAG: Timon_026_f
The Valley is a safe place to be. No one is going to hurt you here; I promise!

TAG: Timon_027_f
I wanna believe you, {PlayerName}, but some of these Villagers are bad news. Like Scar! Mostly Scar, actually...

TAG: Timon_003_f
Why don't you take some time to get settled? Once you've been here a bit, you'll see there's nothing to worry about.

TAG: Timon_028_f
Hakuna Matata and all that, right?

TAG: Timon_022_f
They don't have to.

TAG: Timon_024_f
I can see it in their hungry, carnivorous eyes.

TAG: Timon_023_f
I KNEW IT! Those carnivores DO wanna eat me!

TAG: Timon_025_f
Timon, I was kidding.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Oh, sorry. You're right.

TAG: Timon_009_f
*AHEM*

TAG: Timon_010_f
Thanks for your help, {PlayerName}! Everything's perfect!

TAG: Timon_011_f
If something else is going on, you can always talk to me, Timon.

TAG: Timon_006_f
You sure did. The place is perfect.

TAG: Timon_012_f
So then what's up? Why do you seem so sad?

TAG: Timon_013_f
You know you can talk to me.
