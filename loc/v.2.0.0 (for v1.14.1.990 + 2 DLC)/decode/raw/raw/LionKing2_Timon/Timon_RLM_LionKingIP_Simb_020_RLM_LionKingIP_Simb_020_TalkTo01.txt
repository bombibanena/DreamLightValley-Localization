Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who are you? And why do you smell like my buddy SIMBA?

TAG: Player_000_f
I'm {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Simba sent me to find you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
And Simba's my friend too!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
... Maybe I ate him.

TAG: Timon_001_f
He did?

TAG: Timon_002_f
Why didn't he come find us himself?

TAG: Player_001_f
It's a little complicated. Let's just say...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You have to trust me! He wants you to come with me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
He's somewhere GREAT and I can take you there.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You'll find out in time. Let's go.

TAG: Timon_003_f
Hold on! We aren't goin' anywhere until we know it's someplace we'd actually wanna be.

TAG: Timon_004_f
So even if you're Simba's new friend â and that's a pretty big "IF" â I don't know WHERE you came from, or what kinda animal you are...

TAG: Timon_005_f
... Say... What kinda animal are you, anyway?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
A human.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm a special kind of lion.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
A more relaxed animal than you.

TAG: Timon_006_f
Never heard of it.

TAG: Timon_007_f
Whatever you are, you're too stressed for me and Pumbaa. Before we can consider goin' with you, you've gotta take some hakuna matata lessons from us. And since you're a "friend" of Simba's you'll know all about hakuna matata.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Sounds like fun!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
If you insist...

TAG: Timon_008_f
Okay, then let's get started...

TAG: Timon_009_f
We gotta get to the root of this worry you're givin' off. Are you stressed because you don't have enough fur? A nice sleek coat? Or a big fluffy mane?

TAG: Player_004_f
Maybe... What if I make myself a mane?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
That'll get me into the jungle groove.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I love creative projects!

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
I've always wanted one!

TAG: Timon_010_f
Perfect! That'll be our first step.

TAG: Timon_011_f
Okay, well... First, I'll need to <Lore>gather materials to build a Crafting Station to work at</Lore>...

TAG: Timon_012_f
Tell ya what, you <Lore>bring the stuff to me</Lore> and Pumbaa and I will help build your... whatever it is.

TAG: Timon_013_f
Sure, yeah. If gettin' creative helps you find your "no worries" mindset, let's do it.

TAG: Timon_014_f
Well, what are ya waiting for? Let's make the mane of your dreams!

TAG: Timon_015_f
Oh, come on! Lighten up! This is not a great start, pal.

TAG: Timon_016_f
A lion? I've never seen a lion that looks like YOU before but... Then again, I do my best to avoid most lions.

TAG: Timon_017_f
Hey! An animal I've never seen before just walks in here and says I gotta follow them to find my friend? That is NOT relaxing!

TAG: Timon_018_f
But we're not talkin' about me, we're talkin' about YOU.

TAG: Timon_019_f
Uh-huh. Sure he is. If he's your buddy, why isn't he here with you?

TAG: Timon_020_f
YOU ate HIM?! HA!

TAG: Timon_021_f
Your teeth aren't even sharp! Don't try to kid me, kid. What're you REALLY doin' here?
