Hey, Timon! Our slideshow has taken a bit of a turn...

Scar might be causing trouble. I overheard him with Ursula, it sounds like they are teaming up with Mother Gothel and the Forgotten about something...

TAG: Timon_002_f
I KNEW that creep was up to no good!

TAG: Timon_003_f
I know it doesn't look good...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But the Forgotten isn't a villain!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We definitely can't trust him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We should probably find more evidence...

TAG: Timon_004_f
Then Scar must be tricking them!

TAG: Timon_007_f
I've got no use for him, but he's definitely an evil genius.

TAG: Timon_008_f
We can't jump to any conclusions, though.

TAG: Timon_009_f
I'll go <Lore>investigate the Giant Willow, Scar's Cave, and Ursula's Beach Cave to look for evidence</Lore>. You keep an eye out for Scar and make sure he doesn't know we are on to him!

TAG: Timon_005_f
That's what I've been saying!

TAG: Timon_006_f
What more evidence do we need? The guy is guilty; trust me.
