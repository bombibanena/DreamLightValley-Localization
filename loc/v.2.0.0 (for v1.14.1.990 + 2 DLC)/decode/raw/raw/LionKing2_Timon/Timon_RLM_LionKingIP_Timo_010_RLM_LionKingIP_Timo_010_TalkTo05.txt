Okay, Timon! I've got all the bugs we need! What's next?

Sheesh, this is the tricky part. I remember I combined <Lore>two colors of bug together to make a green oil</Lore>.

And <Lore>two OTHER colors of bug to make an orange oil</Lore>.

After that, you mix the <ActivityItem>Green Bug Oil</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Orange Bug Oil</ActivityItem> together for the final <ActivityItem>Super Slippery Bug Oil</ActivityItem>.
