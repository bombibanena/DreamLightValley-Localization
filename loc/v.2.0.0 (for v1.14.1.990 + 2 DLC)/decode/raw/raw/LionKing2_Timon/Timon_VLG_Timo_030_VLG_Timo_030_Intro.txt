{PlayerName}! I just had the best idea, but I'm gonna need your help with a few minor details. What do ya say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure thing, Timon. What do you need help with?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.

TAG: Timon_002_f
Well, as you must know by now, I was an integral part of Simba's journey to embracing the king within himself.

TAG: Timon_001_f
What if I could do that for others here in the Valley? All these royals and leaders just wandering aimlessly, with no one to guide them towards their true destiny... until now!

TAG: Timon_008_f
I call it... a Timon Talk!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I love the idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you sure you can handle that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
And how can I help with this?

TAG: Timon_005_f
I knew you would! It's got a great ring to it.

TAG: Timon_011_f
So how can I help you?

TAG: Timon_012_f
I need some kinda sign to advertise my talk to all the royalty around here.

TAG: Timon_009_f
Oh, and could ya go see Simba? He'll tell you all about my wisdom and heroics. Make sure he comes to my talk!

TAG: Timon_013_f
Okay, I'll <Lore>talk to Simba</Lore> and <Lore>gather what we need to make some billboards</Lore>! If you want this to go well, you need to start planning out your speech.

TAG: Timon_014_f
Don't worry. My speech is gonna put the "inspire" in "inspirational"!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Public speaking can be tough...

TAG: Timon_006_f
Am I sure I can handle it?! HA! {PlayerName}, didn't you just hear me say I helped Simba on his king's journey?

TAG: Timon_010_f
Okay, okay, so what do I need to do?

TAG: Timon_007_f
So you're in? Excellent!

TAG: Timon_003_f
Gotcha. Maybe later then.
