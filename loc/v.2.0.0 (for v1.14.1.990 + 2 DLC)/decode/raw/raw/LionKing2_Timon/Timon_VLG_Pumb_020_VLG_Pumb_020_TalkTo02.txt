Before you start, the answer is no! I'm NOT doin' Pumbaa's pottery party thing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You don't want to play with clay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It would mean a lot to Pumbaa.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He was right. You're scared to try new things.

Look {PlayerName}, unlike warthogs, meerkats don't DO mud baths. We don't play with mud.

TAG: Timon_007_f
And clay is just fancy mud. Ergo, I don't do clay.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Your paws would be perfect for it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You can wash up after!

TAG: Timon_012_f
Really? Ya think so? All right, fine. You win. I'll come along.

TAG: Timon_013_f
Ugh, I can see you're not gonna let this go. All right, fine. I'll come along... but I won't have fun!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Sheesh! Right for the heart with this, huh?

TAG: Timon_008_f
He's really excited, and he wants you to be there.

TAG: Timon_009_f
Ugh! Fine! I'll do his messy... pottery... thing.

TAG: Timon_006_f
I beg your pardon! I am scared of no such thing!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Time to challenge your inner perfectionist!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
So you're not a perfectionist?

TAG: Timon_010_f
Pfft! Me? A perfectionist?! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

TAG: Timon_011_f
And I'll prove it â in Pumbaa's pottery class!
