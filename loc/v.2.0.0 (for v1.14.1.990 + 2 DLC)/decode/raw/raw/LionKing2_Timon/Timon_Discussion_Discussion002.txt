If you ask me, there's an art to doing absolutely nothing all day.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I like keeping busy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I agree!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yeah, Hakuna Matata.

TAG: Timon_001_f
Well, admitting you need help is the first step! Lucky for you, I'm an expert on the subject.

TAG: Timon_002_f
Stick with me, kid. I'll show you the ropes.

TAG: Timon_003_f
Excellent! Now tell me: How do you relax?

TAG: Player_001_f
With...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...a good book.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...friends.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...my own thoughts.

TAG: Timon_004_f
Those things Merlin's always lookin' at? That's doing way too much somethin' on my day of nothin'!

TAG: Timon_005_f
I think you and I are gonna get along better than warthogs and mud.

TAG: Timon_006_f
Whoa. Talk about Hakuna Matata!

TAG: Timon_007_f
I knew I liked you, kid.

TAG: Timon_008_f
That's right! Glad you're payin' attention.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You talk about it ALL the time.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
It's a great motto!

TAG: Timon_009_f
Well, teaching everyone about Hakuna Matata's hard work! ... Huh. Note to self, "make teaching the motto easier."

TAG: Timon_010_f
That's a "motto" of opinion. Ha! I crack myself up.
