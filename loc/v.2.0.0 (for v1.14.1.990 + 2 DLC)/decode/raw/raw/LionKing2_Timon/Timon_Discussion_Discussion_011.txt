Hmm.

TAG: Timon_001_f
Timon...?

TAG: Timon_002_f
Hold on already! I'm thinkin' about what I'm thinkin' about!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm confused.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds like maybe you're overthinking?

TAG: Timon_003_f
It's like this... my mind's a total blank right now. I've achieved the ultimate relaxation.

TAG: Timon_009_f
I'm not thinkin' about anything!

TAG: Timon_005_f
But you asked what I was thinkin' about, and since I wasn't thinkin' about anything, I really had to think about something to think about to answer you.

TAG: Timon_006_f
Get it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Um... I think so?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not even a little bit.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Surprisingly, yes!

TAG: Timon_010_f
It's really not that complicated.

TAG: Timon_011_f
Well, if you couldn't follow that very clear explanation, I don't know what to say.

TAG: Timon_012_f
Good!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Ha! I don't know the meaning of the word "overthink"!

TAG: Timon_008_f
Overthinkin' leads to worrying, and you know how I feel about worrying.
