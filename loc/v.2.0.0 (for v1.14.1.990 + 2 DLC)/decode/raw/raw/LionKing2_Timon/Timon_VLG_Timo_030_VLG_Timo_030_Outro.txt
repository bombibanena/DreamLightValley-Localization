I did, and they had something interesting to say.

Your friendship is the most important thing!

It was your courage that helped Simba the most.

Your loyalty is the best part of you!

Anyone can eat some weird food or look up at the stars, but what makes you special is how you stand by those you love.

Being a great leader isn't about all this flashy stuff you've been talking about! What a leader needs the most is the help of the friends they trust the most.

TAG: Timon_007_f
Whoa. I never thought of it like that...
