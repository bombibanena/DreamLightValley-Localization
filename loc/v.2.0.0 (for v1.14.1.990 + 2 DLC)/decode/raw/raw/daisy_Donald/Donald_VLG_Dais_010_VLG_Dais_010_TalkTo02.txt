Hey, {PlayerName}. Thanks for helping Daisy clean up.

TAG: Donald_004_f
I just wanted a nice date with her, building that wardrobe together, and then â KERPOW! I ruined everything!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Daisy wants to make up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It was an accident.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Get a grip, Donald.

TAG: Donald_006_f
She does?! Hooray!

TAG: Donald_001_f
I gotta do something for her! Something special â maybe a moonlit cruise? Or I could plant a field of a million daisies, or write her the best love song of all time?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Let's start with the wardrobe.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Donald, you're such a romantic!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Caaaalm down. Let's think small.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Hey, that's a great idea!

TAG: Donald_009_f
Let's get started right away. If you round up plans and the tools, I'll get the materials.

TAG: Donald_010_f
Oh boy, oh boy! Daisy's gonna be so happy! Come see me as soon as you <Lore>get the materials for the wardrobe</Lore>.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Well, Daisy deserves the best! Oh, but growing an entire flower field or writing the greatest song ever might take awhile. Maybe we should start by finishing that wardrobe.

TAG: Donald_007_f
You're right, but... Somehow, these things always happen to me. And Daisy ends up losing. Ya know what? I gotta fix this!

TAG: Donald_008_f
WAAAAKKKK!!! How dare you?! Iâ Uh-oh, there I go again. You're right. It was an accident. I gotta fix things.
