Thanks, {PlayerName}. This is exactly what I need to finish Daisy's new wardrobe. She'll be over the moon!

Hey, it was nothing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you need anything else?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Just be careful with that hammer, all right?

TAG: Donald_002_f
Maybe to you, but not to me. Now I can build Daisy's new wardrobe. It'll be stupendous. I can't wait to show her.

TAG: Donald_001_f
Good luck, Donald. While you do that, maybe I'll <Lore>see how Daisy's doing</Lore>.

TAG: Donald_003_f
Nope! I gotta build this wardrobe myself. I can't wait to show it to Daisy!

TAG: Donald_004_f
You got it! I never make the same mistake twice!

TAG: Donald_005_f
Um...
