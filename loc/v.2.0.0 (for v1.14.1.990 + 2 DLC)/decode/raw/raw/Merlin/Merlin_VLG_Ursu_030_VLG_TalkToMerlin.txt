{PlayerName}! Oh dear, you look worried. Is there something I can help you with?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I just need some paper.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Ursula wants me to sneak into people's houses to get paper.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Does helping Ursula get paper make me a villain?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Oh, well that doesn't seem like anything to get worked up about.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Many of our Villagers have paper in their homes. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to share with you.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I'll just let them know you'll be visiting.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Sneak?! How dare she?! ... Of course, she IS Ursula.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Well, not to worry. We'll get this sorted. I'll simply let our fellow Villagers know you're looking for paper...

TAG: Merlin_006_f
That way you don't have to sneak into their homes to get it.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Well, that's a conundrum indeed! On one hand you are HELPING someone, while on the other hand... it's Ursula.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Of course, it WOULD be wise for you to keep an eye on her...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Yes! Do what she's asked. But I'll let the other Villagers know what you'll be up to. Be careful, {PlayerName}.
