That's strange... suddenly I can't remember why we came in here...

Are you okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Must be the Night Thorns!

It's the Night Thorns! Being near so many of them <Lore>clouds the mind</Lore>.

Focus your magic once again, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Precisely! Being near so many of them <Lore>clouds the mind</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
I sense it too. If only I could remember why...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Ahh! It's those pesky Night Thorns! Being near so many of them is <Lore>clouding my mind</Lore>.
