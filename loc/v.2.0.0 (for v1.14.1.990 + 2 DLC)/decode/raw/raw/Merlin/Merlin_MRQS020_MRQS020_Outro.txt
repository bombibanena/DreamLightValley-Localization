I remember now, {PlayerName}! It's not WHAT's inside the Dream Castle! It's WHO!

TAG: Merlin_022_f
When our Ruler left and the Forgetting took over the Valley, some of us stayed...

TAG: Merlin_023_f
While others decided to <Lore>return to their Realms</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Each door before you leads to a different Realm, a dream of their own world.

TAG: Player_001_f
The Castle is full of doorways to other Realms?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I want to explore new worlds!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm excited to meet new friends!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Is this dangerous...?

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Well, you'll find no shortage of wonders beyond these doors as you seek out the missing Villagers.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Though, I'm afraid they won't remember Dreamlight Valley. So it's up to YOU to <Lore>find a way to bring them home</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Once you step through that door, you'll arrive in another Realm. Help those inside as best you can.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Tell them about Dreamlight Valley and ask for their help.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
We'll need all our friends here to prepare for what's ahead.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
I see you have just enough Dreamlight left to unlock the first door.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
You must <Lore>choose the first Realm</Lore> you want to step into.

TAG: Player_000_f
I want to visit...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A desolate planet with a shy robot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A restaurant with a great little chef.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The ocean with a demigod.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Marvelous! I remember a shy little robot of very few words.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
And the chef you'll find works true magic with food! Chefs and wizards have a lot in common, you know.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
You've the spirit of a true explorer! It bodes well for you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Oh, you'll find countless new friends behind these doors!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I'm afraid I can't say. But I know you're up to whatever challenges might lie beyond these doors. And you'll meet countless friends who can assist you!
