{PlayerName}, I see you've found another <Lore>mysterious Time Rift</Lore>. This too is connected to the magic of your Hourglass.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Channel the magical <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> within it to mend this wound in time and space...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
When you do, you can explore another area of the Wild Tangle... the <Lore>Promenade</Lore>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll channel the magic of the Hourglass... (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyMist" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not quite ready yet...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Well done, {PlayerName}! Now you can visit the Promenade. If memory serves, it's a rather exciting and curious place for a walk.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Eh, it appears we have a bit of a problem. You don't have enough <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> to mend this Time Rift.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Remember... the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> is <Lore>connected to the magic of your Hourglass and to Eternity Isle itself</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
You must keep uncovering wonders with your Hourglass and continue to make Eternity Isle a home. As you do, you'll gain the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> required!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Well, don't take too long, {PlayerName}. The Wild Tangle has a life of its own. I venture you won't want to miss a moment!
