{PlayerName}! Just who I wanted to see. I've devised a way to further enchant your Watering Can.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
You should be able to remove the large inconvenient Mushrooms with it.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
It will require some work, though. Are you ready?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Absolutely! I'm sick of those Mushrooms.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not right now.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
That's the spirit! The first thing we need is <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shard Powder</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Now the Shards are very hard, but we'll need to crush them.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Do you know anyone good at crushing things?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I know a little robot who crushes things.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Maybe Ursula could crush them with a potion.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
You mean WALLÂ·E! Yes, he should be able to help.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Speak to him about this as soon as you can.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Goodness, no! We mustn't allow the Sea Witch anywhere near this sort of power. Besides, this really isn't the kind of work she does.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I know a little robot who crushes things for a living.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Well, I suppose the Mushrooms aren't going anywhere...
