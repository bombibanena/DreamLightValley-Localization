What small discoveries will you make today, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Well, I'm talking to you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't know.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Small discoveries? What do you mean?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Indeed! A conversation can be full of discoveries. What will we say? What will we think?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Where might our inquiry lead us?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Hopefully somewhere useful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Probably just around in circles.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You make talking to someone sound more exciting than it is...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Practical conversations, with purpose and reason, are quite valuable.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
But there are many discoveries to be found in the free flow of thought as well.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Well, when you don't know exactly where you're going, sometimes you get there faster going in circles instead of keeping to a straight line.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Everything can be exciting with the correct perspective.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
How exciting! Not knowing quite what will happen next. The thrill of discovery!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yeah!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maybe?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
It actually makes me nervous.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Well, good luck on your journey, my friend!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Ahh... you respond to uncertainty with more uncertainty. A perfectly appropriate response.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Well, being anxious is perfectly understandable. Just don't let it thwart your curiosity.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
One must be ready for uncertainty before one can thrive in it.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Well, anything can be an opportunity for discovery, if you have the proper attitude.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
For example, a trip to Goofy's Stall. Who knows what one will discover in his inventory today?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
That doesn't sound very exciting.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
EPIC APPLE VS. PEAR DILEMMA.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Being around Goofy is always full of surprises.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Perhaps not on an ordinary day. But what if today is extraordinary?

TAG: Merlin_017_f
The choice is yours.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Goodness, you're certainly getting into the spirit of things.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Ah, yes. His boundless kindness, his unique wisdom...

TAG: Merlin_018_f
...and his occasional prodigious clumsiness...

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Well, there's no one quite like Goofy, is there?
