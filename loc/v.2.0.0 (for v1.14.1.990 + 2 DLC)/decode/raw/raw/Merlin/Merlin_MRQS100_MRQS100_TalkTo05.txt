Ah, I see you've solved the problem with the river on the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
But by the look on your face, I know there's something else bothering you. Come on, out with it!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
As I was coming out of the Vitalys Mines, I saw the Forgotten...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Astounding! Well, don't stop there. What happened next?

TAG: Merlin_019_f
The Forgotten dropped this.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
Well yes, but there's no reason we can't help out nature with a bit of magical nurture.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
Huh? What do you mean?

TAG: Merlin_030_f
I've finally remembered what we used to get from the Vitalys Mines. It wasn't rare gems or precious metals...

TAG: Merlin_031_f
<Lore>There are crystals that grow there.</Lore> When combined with a few other magical ingredients, they <Lore>bring life to the flora around the Village</Lore> at much greater speeds.

TAG: Merlin_032_f
What might have taken months will take mere days.

TAG: Merlin_034_f
Now, first you'll have to <Lore>dig up some <ActivityItem>Vitalys Crystals</ActivityItem> from the mines</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_033_f
Then <Lore>use them to create the <ActivityItem>Miracle Growth Elixir</ActivityItem></Lore>. I took it upon myself to find the recipe after we spoke earlier.

TAG: Merlin_037_f
Once you've done all that, speak to me, and I'll tell you the next step.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Ahh! The <ActivityItem>Orb of Nurturing</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Merlin_021_f
With this, we can restore the Pillar on the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Not so fast. Something's wrong with it. It's all dim inside...

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Yes, I see... Well, this <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> feeds off of <Lore>natural life</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
When you first placed it in the Pillar on the Sunlit Plateau, it took quite a long time to thrive. But once it did, it turned a dry desert into a lush oasis.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
You must plant it in the ground before the Pillar, and let nature take its course.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Sounds like that's going to take a while...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Merlin, the Forgotten looked just like... like...

TAG: Merlin_000_f
...me.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
... Like you?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Oh dear. This is very perplexing, {PlayerName}. Let me consider this...

TAG: Merlin_011_f
... Well, it's possible that the Forgotten is a splinter of yourself that stayed behind when you left the Valley long ago.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A splinter of myself...? How?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Merlin... is this all my fault?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We have to fix this.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
As we grow up, there are always parts of ourselves that we leave behind, pieces of us that no longer... I suppose you could say... fit.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
But just because we're finished with a part of ourselves, it doesn't mean that part of ourselves is finished with us.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
In your case, this may all be manifesting itself a bit more... literally.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
No, no, {PlayerName}. I assure you, none of this is your fault.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Cause and effect is... tricky. The simplest action can lead to unexpected reactions.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
And here in the Valley, things are especially complicated.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
All that matters is what you hold in your heart. We all know that you only want what's best for the Village.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Well, I've always known that the key to restoring our Valley lies with you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Well, speaking of restoring Dreamlight Valley...
