Ah-ha! {PlayerName}, there you are. You, uh, must have heard me cry out "Eureka" after my latest breakthrough.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
It took me days of careful research...

TAG: Merlin_027_f
...and there was, uh, well, heh, there was one regrettable incident in which I nearly turned the library into a toadstool...

TAG: Merlin_028_f
...but I've made quite the discovery.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
Tell me all about it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
Is this the good kind of discovery...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_006_f
A discovery...? Uh-oh. I'm scared.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
I must say, it's quite refreshing to speak to someone who shares the thrill of discovery.

TAG: Merlin_030_f
I'm sure you recall the <ActivityItem>Vitalys Crystals</ActivityItem> you found in the mines beneath the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
I've long suspected that their invigorating properties might prove useful in other ways. And, I've... well, I've proven myself correct!

TAG: Merlin_032_f
I created special elixirs that will help you carry out your duties.

TAG: Merlin_033_f
There's one for your Royal Shovel, one for your Royal Pickaxe, and one for your Royal Fishing Rod.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
What have you got for my Shovel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
What have you got for my Pickaxe?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
What have you got for my Fishing Rod?

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
I'm ready to try them out!

TAG: Merlin_034_f
A, uh, fine question. There's no quicker way to get to the bottom of things than with a shovel, now is there?

TAG: Merlin_035_f
If you apply the <ActivityItem>Miracle Shovel Varnish</ActivityItem>, you'll be able to discover more treasures by digging.

TAG: Merlin_037_f
In the end, it was a simple enough formula. Ten <ActivityItem>Vitalys Crystals</ActivityItem>, ten pieces of <ActivityItem>Dry Wood</ActivityItem>, and a great deal of <ActivityItem>Dreamlight</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Merlin_038_f
As you must know by now, there's, heh, well, the fastest means of clearing away your problems is with your Pickaxe.

TAG: Merlin_039_f
And now, thanks to this <ActivityItem>Miracle Pickaxe Polish</ActivityItem>, you can mine more gems with each swing.

TAG: Merlin_040_f
I'm sure Mr. McDuck will be happy to hear that! How do I make it?

TAG: Merlin_041_f
It takes nothing more than a little ingenuity... oh, and, of course, ten <ActivityItem>Vitalys Crystals</ActivityItem>, five pieces of <ActivityItem>Onyx</ActivityItem>, and a great deal of <ActivityItem>Dreamlight</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_042_f
Ah, yes. There's nothing that captures the thrill of discovery quite like fishing, is there? One never knows what one might reel in.

TAG: Merlin_043_f
If you use this <ActivityItem>Miracle Fishing Bait</ActivityItem>, you're sure to discover more in the waters around the Valley than you ever have before.

TAG: Merlin_044_f
To make your own, you'll need to get ten <ActivityItem>Vitalys Crystals</ActivityItem>, fish five pieces of <ActivityItem>Red Algae</ActivityItem>, and produce a great deal of <ActivityItem>Dreamlight</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_045_f
Marvelous! I'll give you the first potions I've made. Then, if you'd like more, simply visit a Crafting Station and follow the instructions I've provided.

TAG: Merlin_046_f
Oh, and you should see what occurs if you experiment with even more ingredients. Perhaps you'll make some discoveries yourself.

TAG: Merlin_047_f
Why, I'd surmise that the results, heh, well, they would be even more miraculous!

TAG: Merlin_048_f
Why, yes. This discovery will prove quite useful, I assure you.

TAG: Merlin_049_f
Now, now, there's no cause for concern.
