{PlayerName}... I suspect you're dealing with another matter that might decide the fate of the whole Village.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
But I suppose that's just all in a day's work for you.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I found a certain surly lion in the giant skull in the Elephant Graveyard...

TAG: Merlin_011_f
... A lion? You couldn't possibly mean... Scar?!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
That's right. He asked me for help to restore the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Be very wary, my friend. Scar is just as treacherous as Ursula. He's not working with you out of kindness. There's always something in it for him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He seems nice enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Duly noted. I'll watch my back.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He thinks he's king around here and I'm just one of his hyenas...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
*sigh* {PlayerName}, trusting others can be a strength...

TAG: Merlin_014_f
...but only when they've earned that trust. Don't believe a word that duplicitous lion says to you.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Of all the villains in the Valley, I have a special aversion to Scar.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
He refuses to learn my name, and insists on referring to me as "the windbag with the pointy blue head feather and the unkempt white mane."

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Ugh. So rude!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
... That is kind of funny though.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Rude indeed. Now, what did Scar tell you?

TAG: Merlin_017_f
He told me that if I wanted to restore life to the Pillar of Nurturing, I'd need to fix whatever was blocking the river in the Vitalys Mines...

TAG: Merlin_024_f
The Vitalys Mines! Good gracious! I'd forgotten all about those!

TAG: Merlin_025_f
I went inside and explored them. They're...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...huge!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...scary!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...oddly beautiful.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
That they are... Hmph. I wish I could remember what was mined in there...

TAG: Merlin_035_f
Precisely! The fizzier, the better.

TAG: Merlin_037_f
Of course, they only worked on the smallest, least virulent Night Thorns.

TAG: Merlin_036_f
But if you <Lore>use that recipe to whip up some especially fizzy <ActivityItem>Root Beer</ActivityItem> and combine it with the <ActivityItem>Crackling Candy</ActivityItem>...</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_032_f
Why, that just might be enough to stop this problem at its root!

TAG: Merlin_027_f
The river's being blocked by the roots of some Giant Night Thorns that grew down from the cliffs above.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
My magic doesn't seem to work on them.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
I see. I see... Well, perhaps some more mundane substance could kill the Night Thorns at their roots...

TAG: Merlin_030_f
I found a note someone left tacked up in the mine... a bunch of ingredients lying around... some <ActivityItem>Crackling Candies</ActivityItem>... and a recipe for <ActivityItem>Extra Fizzy Root Beer</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Merlin_031_f
Brilliant! This means your job is already half complete!

TAG: Merlin_033_f
Before you arrived, there was only one way we could keep the Night Thorns at bay.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
<Lore>Sugary, carbonated beverages!</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_034_f
Huh? Really? Like... root beer?

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Funny?! Now see here! There's nothing humorous about it. Why, I ought to turn him into a house cat.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Sorry. I didn't realize it was such a sore spot.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Yes, yes, well... I've gotten myself so worked up, I forgot the matter at hand. What did Scar tell you?

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Good. The number of villains in the Village is growing. We must take heed.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Oh, that's just like him. The pompous, lazy miscreant!
