Ah, ah, don't say anything, {PlayerName}. I'm a soothsayer after all. I know what you're here to tell me!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
...

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Bah! My memories of the future are cloudy today! You'll have to tell me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I found Kristoff in the Forest!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Donald Duck stepped through a Dark Portal.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I need a way to find Donald.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Kristoff...? Yes, yes! Isn't he the lad who plays the flute? Or is it the glockenspiel?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
The lute!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I don't know.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Yes! The lute!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I thought he left the Village after the Forgetting like everyone else. He must have stayed for a reason.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Oh my! Donald found himself a portal, you say... Hmm, perhaps a gateway to another world...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
And this Dark Grove is full of mist?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Could that portal lead to the same place as the one you saw on the Beach?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
So many questions... But let's make haste! Donald could be in danger. We need a way to find him.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Well, there's only one way to find him. We'll need to create a <Lore>tracking spell</Lore> that will work in that Dark Grove.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
You'll need a few <ActivityItem>Emeralds</ActivityItem>, a plant from the Dark Grove and a few <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>... I'm sure you'll figure out a way to gather everything.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
When you're ready, bring them to me.
