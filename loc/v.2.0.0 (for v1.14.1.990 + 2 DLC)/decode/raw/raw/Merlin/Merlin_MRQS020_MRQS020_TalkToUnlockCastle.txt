Splendid! The Dreamlight is pooling in the depths of the Well!

You now have enough Dreamlight to <Lore>repel the Night Thorns on the Castle's door</Lore>.

We mustn't waste any time! Hurry! Hurry!

However, before we go... I'm worried about <Lore>Mickey</Lore>. Have you seen him yet?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I haven't encountered him since you arrived. We must be sure that he's all right.

Please check on him at his House and then meet me at the Castle.
