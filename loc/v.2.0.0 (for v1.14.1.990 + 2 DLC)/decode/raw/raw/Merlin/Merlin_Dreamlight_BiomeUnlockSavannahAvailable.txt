Now I know you haven't been to the Sunlit Plateau yet. Take it from me: It's not to be missed! Of course, you'll have to remove these Night Thorns to clear the path.

Let's go to the Sunlit Plateau. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyDreamlight" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Perhaps some other time.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Good show, {PlayerName}! You've cleared the way to the Sunlit Plateau!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
It seems your magic isn't quite strong enough to reach the Sunlit Plateau. You'll have to gather more Dreamlight.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
All right. But remember: Only YOU have the power to open the blocked Biomes of the Village.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I'm afraid there's Dark Magic emanating from the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
We'll have to fix the Pillar of Friendship in the Meadow if we want to access new Biomes in the Village.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
The curse in the Meadow requires investigation. We must talk about that soon.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Oh dear. There's Dark Magic emanating from the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
But we should gain access to the Dream Castle before we explore farther.
