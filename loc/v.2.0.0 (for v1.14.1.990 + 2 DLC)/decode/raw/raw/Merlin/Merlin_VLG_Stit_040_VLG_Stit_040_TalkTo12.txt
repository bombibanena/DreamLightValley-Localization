Hey, Merlin, I was wondering ifâ

TAG: Merlin_000_f
If I want to join Stitch's musical ensemble?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Remember, {PlayerName}: I've already been to the future.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
And Stitch's band is something the blasted Forgetting didn't let me forget.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Yeah, you got it. Stitch wants to play music for the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You could sing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You could shake a tambourine?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You could do an enchantment to keep him in tune?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Well, I have been known to warble a tune or two, but I'm not sure I'd be right for the kind of music Stitch wants to make.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Do let me know when the first performance will be, though, won't you? I'm quite intrigued by this "rock and roll music."

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Why, it seems almost as ingenious an innovation as indoor plumbing.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
That hardly sounds like the best use of my time with all that's going on around here.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I'm not sure that's the wisest use of magic. And besides, if I did, Stitch would never improve his skills.
