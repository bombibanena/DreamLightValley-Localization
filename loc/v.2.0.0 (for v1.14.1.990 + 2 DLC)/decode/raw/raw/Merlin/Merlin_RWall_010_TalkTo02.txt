WALLÂ·E? Hmm... Ah, yes, I remember now! A charming little robot.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
He seemed rather happy in the Valley before. I suppose you must first win his trust.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Consider... what does he like?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Plants.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Collecting things.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
<ActivityItem>Trash Cubes</ActivityItem>... apparently.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Yes! Plants are one of the many things that WALLÂ·E enjoys collecting!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Talk to Scrooge McDuck. He's a collector too, you know.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
He might have some bits and baubles around that you can bring to WALLÂ·E.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Who knows? Maybe Mr. McDuck's trash can become WALLÂ·E's treasure!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Indeed! He'd certainly appreciate some additions to his collection.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Yes, well, that is his profession, but I don't think it's what he's passionate about.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Consider bringing him things he might treasure... even if they seem like trash to you.
