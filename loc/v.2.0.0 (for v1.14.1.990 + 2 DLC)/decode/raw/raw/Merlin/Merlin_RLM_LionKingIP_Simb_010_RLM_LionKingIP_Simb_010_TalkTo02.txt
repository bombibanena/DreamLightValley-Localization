Hmm... I get the peculiar feeling that you've stumbled upon yet another magical mystery, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
And considering where you've been, I surmise it involves lions.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Well, er, have I surmised correctly?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You nailed it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm trying to help Simba.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Well done! You should add "surmiser" to your resume.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Ah-ha! Do tell me more.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Like slipping into a dream of some place you once knew, long ago.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
The Realms are tied to their memories and their feelings.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
It's possible that the sky in Simba's Realm is clouded precisely because his memories of his father are clouded with uncertainty.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
So how do I help him?

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Simba will need some magical aid... and some help with his troubles.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
You'll have to start by creating some sort of object to channel the spell. Something that holds meaning to Simba.

TAG: Player_003_f
Hmm. But what kind of object would hold meaning for a lion?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
A cat toy?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Maybe a platter full of grubs?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Something from his past?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I passed through that door in the Castle and found myself in a new Realm, somewhere in a jungle.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
I met Simba there. But he won't come back to Dreamlight Valley unless I can help him see the stars.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
He wants to get some guidance from the great kings of the past.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
That shouldn't prove to be too difficult. There's almost nothing as constant as the stars. Simply wait for night and then... well... look up.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
That's the problem. Simba can't even remember the last time he saw the stars. It's always cloudy.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
I think something strange is going on. Possibly something magical...?

TAG: Merlin_016_f
That is a bit odd. But I suspect I know the explanation.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
The Realms that you visit are worlds the Villagers created when they needed to escape Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Merlin_030_f
There is a difference between a lion and a common housecat, you know.

TAG: Merlin_034_f
You'll need something personal to him.

TAG: Merlin_035_f
Wait! I've got it.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Simba mentioned someone bopping him over the head with a walking stick to knock some sense into him.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
That sounds like precisely what you'll need. Just the sight of it might be enough.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Next you'll need to infuse it with <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Once you've done that, <Lore>find the point in the jungle nearest the sky, point the walking stick towards the clouds, and command them to part</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
Be careful, though. This is dangerous magic. You'll be influencing the very fabric of reality in the Realm.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
It'll be worth it to help Simba.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
He really seems to like grubs.

TAG: Merlin_033_f
I don't think that will do. He might like eating them, but I doubt they hold much sentimental value.

TAG: Merlin_032_f
Yes, precisely.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Ah, of course. Our old friend, Simba! See, I was right â lions!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
You could put it right between "wizard" and "prognosticator."

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Well then, I suppose that means I got it right. Now, tell me what happened exactly.
