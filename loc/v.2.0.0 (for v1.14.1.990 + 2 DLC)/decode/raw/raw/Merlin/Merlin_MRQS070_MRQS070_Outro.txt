{PlayerName}, you've returned the <ActivityItem>Orb of Power</ActivityItem> to its rightful place! Bravo! You've done marvelous things for our Village, my friend.

Though I suppose the Sea Witch is free now. Rather unfortunate consequence, eh?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Her name is Ursula!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It was the only way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm not going to leave ANYONE behind.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Oh, I see you've become fast friends. Well, be careful, {PlayerName}. Ursula will do anything to increase her power.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
And I'm sure she sees the power within you.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Yes, you're quite right. The Forgetting is a far greater threat than she will ever be.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
And if the Forgetting is what trapped her, you did the right thing in releasing her.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Just be careful, {PlayerName}. Ursula will do almost anything to increase her power.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Yes, yes, quite right. We will need everyone working together to fight the Forgetting.
