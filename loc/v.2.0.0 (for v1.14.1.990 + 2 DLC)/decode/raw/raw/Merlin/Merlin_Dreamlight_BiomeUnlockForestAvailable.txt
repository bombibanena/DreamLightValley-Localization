You really must visit the Forest of Valor! Splendid place. Remove the Night Thorns blocking the path, and you should be able to stroll right in.

Perhaps some other time.

Quite impressive. You've cleared the way to the Forest of Valor!

It seems your magic isn't quite strong enough to reach the Forest of Valor. You'll have to gather more Dreamlight.

I fear the Forest of Valor is exuding Dark Magic.

The Pillar of Friendship in the Meadow must be fixed. That should allow us access to new Biomes in the Village.

We must investigate the curse in the Meadow. So let's be sure to talk about it soon.

I'm afraid there's Dark Magic emanating from the Forest of Valor.

But we should gain access to the Dream Castle before we explore farther.
