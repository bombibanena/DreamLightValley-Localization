I was right! The <ActivityItem>Night Shard</ActivityItem> is purified!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
It's shiny.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Indeed. Very shiny. It's also a significant magical discovery!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Can I give it to one of my friends?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Oh... Well, yes. I don't see the harm. After all, the discovery is far more important than the object.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
And as they are rather rare, I'm sure a friend would be grateful to receive such a gift.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Well, off with you! Give it to your friend. I'll be pondering our next experiment.
