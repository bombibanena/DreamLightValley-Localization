I have to find the Orbs...

TAG: Merlin_000_f
This Pillar is just one of many scattered around the Village.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
For as long as I can remember, <Lore>the Pillars protected the Valley</Lore> and kept it safe from Dark Magic. But no longer.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
I'm afraid the Pillars are broken, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How did they break?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's wrong with them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How do I fix them?

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Well, you see, they're no longer whole. A vital piece of each has gone missing. And it's those pieces you'll need to find.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
...and others were stolen for their magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
To keep the Village safe.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
To restore the Village's virtues.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
To get all that magic for myself!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Each Pillar once contained an <ActivityItem>Orb of Virtue</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
The <ActivityItem>Orbs</ActivityItem> are filled with powerful magic. And each one stood for a virtue around which the Old Ruler built the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
These virtues are some of the most powerful kinds of magic there are... Trust, Friendship, Power... just to name a few.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
Power is one of the virtues...?

TAG: Merlin_029_f
Yes! Power can be virtuous if it's wielded wisely... which I'm afraid it rarely is. That's how we've ended up with such a magical mess on our hands.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
So what happened to the <ActivityItem>Orbs</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
When our Ruler disappeared, some were lost...

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Some were forgotten...

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Exactly! As long as you keep what's best for the Village in your heart, you'll stay on the right track.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Now, this Pillar held the <ActivityItem>Orb of Friendship</ActivityItem>, one of the most powerful <ActivityItem>Orbs</ActivityItem> in the Village.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
That <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> is now tangled in a Night Thorn fiercer than any you've encountered before.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Since the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> got stuck, the Well in the Meadow fell prey to a curse and we can no longer use it.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
You must free the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> from the Thorns by proving that you have the power of friendship.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm an awesome friend.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll keep bringing more friends to the Village.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Haven't I proven myself enough?!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
That you are. Though a little modesty wouldn't hurt. Heh-heh. Now, just remember that while it's very important for our friends to return to the Valley...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
...we mustn't forget about those who are already here, trying to rebuild their lives.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Small acts of kindness go a long way.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
You know, like giving someone a gift just because you think they'd like it...

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Spending time together... What do you modern kids call it? "Hanging out"?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
So, talk to the Villagers to get to know them. Most importantly, let them get to know you.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Once you understand this, the <ActivityItem>Orb of Friendship</ActivityItem> will be yours. Return it to its rightful place and the curse of the Well will be lifted.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Yes, yes, it's extremely important to get our friends back, but that isn't enough.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Friendship isn't about proving yourself. It's about sharing your heart.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
That's right. We can't forget what's truly important. When these Pillars are working, they help to remind us.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Oh dear. I'm afraid that if you're thinking only of yourself, you'll never be able to restore the Pillars.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
By making them whole again. Find the vital pieces missing from each.
