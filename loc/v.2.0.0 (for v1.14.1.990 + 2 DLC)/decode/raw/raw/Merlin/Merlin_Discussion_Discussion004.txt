{PlayerName}... Now, I know you're not a wizard, but have you ever heard of a Wizards' Duel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Then you know how it works.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
My last bout with Madam Mim... well, it... it was a bit of a grudge match, you might say. We needn't be so brutal.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Since you can't change forms, we'll just say the names of what we WOULD change into. And let's stick to animals, shall we?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Here, I'll start... I choose the form of a tortoise!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Raccoon.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Rabbit.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Elephant.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
A reasonable choice... A raccoon might be able to prey on a young tortoise.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
But I assure you I am an old, venerable tortoise and quite immune to your raccoon attacks.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I win this duel.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
A rabbit? Do you intend to challenge tortoise-me to a race?

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Well, I know a fable that will tell you how that goes. Heh-heh. I win.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Seems a bit extreme, but I suppose in a contest of brawn an elephant would win against a tortoise.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Then I shall become a mouse and terrify your elephant.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Cat.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Dog.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Robot.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Yes, that is a classic response. Cat catches mouse.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Then I will make the classic response in turn and transform into a dog.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Wolf.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Human.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Dragon.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Hmph. Wolf and dog. One is a descendant of the other, so the forms are quite close. I shall declare this contest a draw.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Very clever! Humans are indeed animals. And they've domesticated almost every dog on the planet!

TAG: Merlin_021_f
An astute response. I concede the game to you, {PlayerName}. You win!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Ah! No creatures of legend! That is against the rules... I did tell you that part, didn't I?

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Well, either way, there is no rule-bound response to dragon, so our little contest is over.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Hmph! Any mouse worth his salt can evade a dog. No, I think I've won this one.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
A robot is not an animal. I win by default!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Well, it's a classic battle of wits, where each player takes turns changing into different things.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
The goal is to defeat the other player's form!
