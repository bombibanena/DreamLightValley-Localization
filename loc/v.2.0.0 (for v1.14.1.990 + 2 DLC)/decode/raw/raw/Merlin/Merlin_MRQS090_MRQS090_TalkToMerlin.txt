Blast it all! We have a new problem. There's some sort of Dark Magic hanging over the great tree in the Glade of Trust.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
This is different from the other Dark Magic we've faced. It's trickier; far more powerful.

I suspect one of the Villagers was meddling in bewitchments that have no place in this Valley, and it went terribly wrong.

I feared that not even your vast magic would be enough to lift the spell. But now that the <ActivityItem>Orbs of Friendship, Power, and Courage</ActivityItem> are back in their rightful places, I know I can trust you with this task.

You want me to go to the Glade of Trust and try to lift the Dark Magic from the tree?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I won't let you down.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That seems a little scary...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why not do it yourself?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
That's the spirit, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Now, as soon as you can, <Lore>head to the Glade</Lore> and focus your magic on the tree.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Before you can trust anyone else, you must trust in yourself, {PlayerName}. I know you can do this.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I fear my magic isn't strong enough yet. But you've demonstrated that yours certainly is!
