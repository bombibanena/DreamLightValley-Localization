{PlayerName}, have you noticed all the hidden treasures scattered about the Village?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Someone has left countless chests containing all sorts of valuable things. Vestments, furnishings, money...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
It's quite a mystery as to who might have left them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe they're from before the Forgetting?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe they just... appeared there.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
That would be the most logical assumption, yes.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Of course, just because something's logical doesn't mean it works that way here.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
In any case, some of the treasures are better hidden than others.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I suggest making a thorough investigation of the Valley. You never know where you might find something useful.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
An intriguing suggestion. Perhaps the Valley itself is trying to provide us with gifts.
