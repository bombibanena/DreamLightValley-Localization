Now, I must say, something is perplexing me, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Clearly, not all the laws of physics apply here in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
From the way you're able to cross between worlds, it appears space and time here are merely strong suggestions... not ironclad laws.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Yet other things remain immutable. Take gravity, for instance. What goes up still invariably comes down!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I wish it didn't. I'd love to fly.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's weird. Maybe we should run some tests.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe the laws of physics only work if we believe they do.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Yes, I imagine it's an intriguing possibility for you.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
But for now, I'm afraid you'll have to content yourself with exploring the mysteries of the Valley down here on the ground.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
In any case, it seems that we are bound together by something much greater than gravity. I've a theory that it's friendship, but I'm still investigating.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Ah-ha! A fine idea indeed.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Er... just don't throw anything too valuable from anywhere too high, all right?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
A fascinating idea!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Perhaps if we could get all the Villagers to try NOT to follow the law of gravity anymore, it would disappear!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
No, no, no. That's preposterous. How would that even be possible? Never mind me.
