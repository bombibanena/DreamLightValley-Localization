Bravo! Well done, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Not only have you driven back the darkness that was hanging over the Village, but you've found all the Tools that were left by our previous Ruler!

TAG: Merlin_035_f
With their enchantments, you are well armed to face what lies ahead.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
<Lore>The Pickaxe</Lore> can only be wielded by one who is worthy â which you most certainly are! In your hands, it will split rocks with just a swing.

TAG: Merlin_036_f
<Lore>The Watering Can</Lore> never needs to be refilled. It will speed up the growing process for crops, and keep all that blooms here healthy.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
<Lore>The Fishing Rod</Lore> needs no bait and never gets snagged! With it, you can fish what lies at the bottom of the deepest sea and the shallowest pond.

TAG: Merlin_037_f
As for <Lore>the Shovel</Lore>...

TAG: Merlin_038_f
...well, it's just a shovel.

TAG: Merlin_039_f
But a very good one! You'll need it for gardening and finding objects hidden in the ground around the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
And now that you've found all the <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem>, the Wishing Well is sensing your newfound powers!

TAG: Merlin_025_f
You're ready to take on the Well's duties and collect the Dreamlight needed to <Lore>remove the Night Thorns from the Castle door</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Let's start with how it all works. <Lore>Gaze into the Well</Lore> to see what the Valley needs.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
Completing even the simplest tasks will bring great change and help end the Forgetting...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
...as long as they're done in a spirit of love, care, and friendship!

TAG: Merlin_030_f
Then, once you've gathered enough Dreamlight to remove those pesky Night Thorns from the Castle, come and find me!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
You really should explore the Valley, {PlayerName}. There are still Villagers scattered around here who need your help.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Now off you go! Find them, quickly.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
My word! You've pulled the Pickaxe from the stone!

TAG: Merlin_034_f
Oh and... and look! Now that the enchanted Pickaxe is in the hands of someone worthy again...

TAG: Merlin_018_f
...the blasted darkness that's hung over the Valley has finally disappeared!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Call me the "Hero of Dreamlight Valley"!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Just trying to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What should I do next?

TAG: Merlin_032_f
Heh-heh. No, no, I'm afraid one can't simply decide that they're a hero. That's a title which must be bestowed upon you by your peers.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I hope you're ready, for it's your destiny to bring great change to Dreamlight Valley...

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
What kind of change?

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
I like the Valley how it is.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
What do I do?

TAG: Merlin_033_f
But I know you'll do many great deeds here and prove yourself worthy.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
And the <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem> will help you do them!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
<Lore>The Pickaxe</Lore> can only be wielded by one who is worthy â which you most certainly are! In your hands, it will split rocks with just a swing.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
As for <Lore>the Shovel</Lore>...

TAG: Merlin_026_f
...well, it's just a shovel.

TAG: Merlin_040_f
But a very good one! You'll need it for gardening and finding objects hidden in the ground around the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Well, that's entirely in your hands.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
You've already started on your journey. Why, because of you, I'm remembering how Dreamlight Valley once was and how it can be in the future.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
We've lost so much, you know. Not just memories and tools...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
...but magic and friendship, too.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Those of us who stayed when the Forgetting began have been scattered; some are even trapped.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Yes, yes... but it has the potential to be so much more.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Which says marvelous things about your character! Yes, yes, I see many more great deeds in your future.
