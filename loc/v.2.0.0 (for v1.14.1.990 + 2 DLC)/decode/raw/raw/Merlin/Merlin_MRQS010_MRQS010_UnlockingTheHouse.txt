I've consulted my notes and discovered that Night Thorns began infesting Dreamlight Valley soon after our Ruler disappeared.

TAG: Merlin_045_f
No one, not even I, can remove the blasted things.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Only someone who can harness the magic of Dreamlight will be able to.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
And I'm certain that someone is you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
Of course! Why else would I be here?

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
But I'm just... ordinary.

TAG: Player_006_choice_002_f
How do I remove them?

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Well then, don't let ME get in your way.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
Now, focus your thoughts on the Night Thorns...

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
That sounds too easy.

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
Yes! Let's do this!

TAG: Player_007_choice_002_f
Gross. It's all dirty.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Perhaps it is... or perhaps it's the hardest thing you've ever done. Only one way to find out...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Feel the magic within yourself, and say the magic word.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
"Abracadabra!"

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
"Higitus Figitus!"

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!"

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Straight to the point and quite a classic...

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Ah-ha! You've done it! Bravo! Bravo!

TAG: Merlin_051_f
{PlayerName}, this proves you CAN harness the power of Dreamlight Magic!

TAG: Merlin_029_f
Well then, there's no time to lose. Let's go inside and see what's become of this House.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Ha-ha! I'll take that as a compliment.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Ah! The Fairy Godmother's magical phrase. Wise choice...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
I sense the magic within you already!

TAG: Merlin_032_f
Focus on it, and say the magic words.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
You'll have time to spruce it up later. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
That may be, but I've seen seemingly ordinary people do extraordinary things before!

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Magic is different for all who practice it.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
But all YOU need to do is focus your thoughts on the task at hand...
