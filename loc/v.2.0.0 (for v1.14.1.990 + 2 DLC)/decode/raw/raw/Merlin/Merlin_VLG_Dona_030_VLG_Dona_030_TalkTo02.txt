I hear you might know how to open the <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem> that Donald and I dug up?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I ought to know how to open it. I'm the one who enchanted it, after all!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Perfect! So what's inside?

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Now hold on! Just because I know how to open it, doesn't mean I'm going to go to all that trouble myself.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
But I'd be happy to tell you how to do it. I found all the details in one of my journals.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
You see, the <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem> is under an <ActivityItem>Odorous Magnificus</ActivityItem> enchantment.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Odorous Magâ What?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
So it has to do with smells?

TAG: Merlin_014_f
<ActivityItem>Odorous Magnificus</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
The <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem> will only open if it's presented with precisely the right scent. Quite ingenious, if I do say so myself!

TAG: Merlin_017_f
The right scent, huh? Hope it's a good one.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Take this recipe and find out. It has everything you need to produce just the right fragrance.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Once you have this mixed together, come see me and we'll open that <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Precisely!
