Well now, what do you have there, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Goodness gracious! My sock! I've been looking for this everywhere.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
The Fairy Godmother conjured these for me long ago. They're my most cherished pair.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Even when the Forgetting made me forget her name, if I held these socks close, I could almost remember my dear friend's face.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Wait a moment... it looks like this sock has been a bit... slobbered upon.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sorry about that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Wasn't me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's space alien slobber.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
No, no. There's no need to apologize... unless it's you who salivated on them, of course.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
There's someone going around stealing everybody's stuff and dropping it everywhere. You might have heard Donald talking about it.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Hmm, yes, I have heard him going on about extraterrestrials of some sort.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
But we have enough magical muddles around here without worrying about that.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
So do you think Donald's quacking up the wrong tree? Or have you noticed anything else going missing?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Now that you mention it... someone's been pilfering books and causing a great commotion in the Dreamlight Library.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Hm. <Lore>Maybe I can find a clue in there...</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I should hope not. I would be a bit concerned the Forgetting had gotten to you too if you were chewing on socks.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Space aliens, you say? Hmph.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
A dear friend conjured these for me long ago. They're my most cherished pair.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
When I hold them close... well, I can almost remember her face.
