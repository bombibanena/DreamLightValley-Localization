Confound it, Ursula! I have the spell, but I can't be the one who performs it! It MUST be you.

Fine. Once again, I'll do ALL the work!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Just remember: You brought me this spell. Your hands aren't clean of this, old man.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I'm putting my trust in you, Ursula. DO NOT make me regret it.
