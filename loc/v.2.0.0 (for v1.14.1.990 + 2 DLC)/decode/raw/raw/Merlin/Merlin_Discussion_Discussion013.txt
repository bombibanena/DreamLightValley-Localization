{PlayerName}, just in time! I've spent the morning making a close study of the Night Thorns around the Village.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
What kind of a study?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Well, I enchanted one so it would get up and walk around.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Uh... why?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How fascinating!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You WHAT?!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
I wanted to understand its motivations. With the gift of locomotion we can see what it does when not tied to the earth. What it CHOOSES to do.

Leapt across the table and assailed me, of course.

TAG: Merlin_005_f

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Oh, a little danger is worth it, as long as we learn something.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
And what did we learn...?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Not to enchant Night Thorns, of course.
