My word! You've pulled the Pickaxe from the stone!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Oh and... and look! Now that the enchanted Pickaxe is in the hands of someone worthy again...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
...the blasted darkness that's hung over the Valley has finally disappeared!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Call me the "Hero of Dreamlight Valley"!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Just trying to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
What should I do next?

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Heh-heh. No, no, I'm afraid one can't simply decide that they're a hero. That's a title which must be bestowed upon you by your peers.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
But I know you'll do many great deeds here and prove yourself worthy.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Now, the Pickaxe is just one of the tools that will aid you on your journey.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Not only will it help you find gems, but you can use it to break through rocks and stones to explore the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I see now that it's your destiny to bring great change to our Village...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What kind of change?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I like the Village how it is.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What do I do?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Well, that's entirely in your hands.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
You've already started on your journey. Why, because of you, I'm remembering how Dreamlight Valley once was and how it can be in the future.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
We've lost so much, you know. Not just memories and tools...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
...but magic and friendship, too.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Those of us who stayed when the Forgetting began have been scattered; some are even trapped.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
It's up to you to find them!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Yes, yes... but it has the potential to be so much more.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Which says marvelous things about your character! Yes, yes, I see many more great deeds in your future.
