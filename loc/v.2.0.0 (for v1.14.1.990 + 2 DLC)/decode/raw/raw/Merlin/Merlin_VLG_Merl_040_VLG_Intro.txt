{PlayerName}, I'm glad you found me! I have made a marvelous discovery!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Do you have time to hear about it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Yes, I'm ready to listen!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Can't right now. I've got to run!

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Well then, I found a strange black crystal buried in the Forest.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
It's near the Dark Portal that Donald went through.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Most remarkably, it's imbued with magic similar to the Night Thorns.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
We must investigate to learn more.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I'm ready!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It sounds creepy.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
That's the spirit! Our curiosity will spur us onward!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Creepy, yes. It's certainly that. But that's all the more reason to investigate.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Fine, fine. Come back when you're prepared!
