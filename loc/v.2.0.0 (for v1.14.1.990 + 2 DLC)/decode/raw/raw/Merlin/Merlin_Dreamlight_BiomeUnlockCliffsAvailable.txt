{PlayerName}, I don't believe you've visited the Frosted Heights yet. It's a Biome in the Valley that's unfortunately blocked by Night Thorns. But once you've cleared those away, be sure to visit.

Let's go to the Frosted Heights. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyDreamlight" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Perhaps some other time.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Oh, that's good news indeed! You may now visit the Frosted Heights!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
It seems your magic isn't quite strong enough to reach the Frosted Heights. You'll have to gather more Dreamlight.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
All right. But remember: Only YOU have the power to open the blocked Biomes of the Village.
