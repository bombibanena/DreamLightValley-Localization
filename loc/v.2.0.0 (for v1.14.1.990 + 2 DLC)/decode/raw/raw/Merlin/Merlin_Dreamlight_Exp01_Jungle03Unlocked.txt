{PlayerName}, I see you've found another <Lore>mysterious Time Rift</Lore>. This too is connected to the magic of your Hourglass.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Channel the magical <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> within it to mend this wound in time and space...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
When you do, you can explore another area of the Wild Tangle... the <Lore>Grove</Lore>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll channel the magic of the Hourglass... (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyMist" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not quite ready yet...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
At last! You can explore the Grove, {PlayerName}! Why, it's almost as if this grove hums with life of its own, all waiting to be discovered!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Yes... yes... What?! No! You don't have enough <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> to mend this Time Rift.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Remember... the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> is <Lore>connected to the magic of your Hourglass and to Eternity Isle itself</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
You must keep uncovering wonders with your Hourglass and continue to make Eternity Isle a home. As you do, you'll gain the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> required!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Well, that's fine, but don't take long. There's much to discover, you know.
