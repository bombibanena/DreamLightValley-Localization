Ahh. Quite a powerful scent you've stirred up, isn't it? This should do the trick.

Smells great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Too perfume-y!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Blech!

Perhaps Scrooge would like to sell it as a new fragrance... but that's a concern for another day.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Let's give this a try...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Ah-ha! Just as I surmised. The smell has unlocked the <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
As for opening it and investigating whatever's inside... well, I'll leave that to you.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Well, you don't need to like it. You just need it to open the <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem> for us.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Oh, it's not so bad. Why, I might even use it as a room freshener once we're done opening the <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem>.
