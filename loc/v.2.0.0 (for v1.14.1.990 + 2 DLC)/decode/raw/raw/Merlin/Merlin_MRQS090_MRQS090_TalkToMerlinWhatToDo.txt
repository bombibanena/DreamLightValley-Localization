{PlayerName}! So all this Dark Magic is Mother Gothel's doing, eh? I should have known.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
She didn't mean to do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
We better keep an eye on her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
How do we fix all this?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
If you meddle in Dark Magic, you have to expect the unexpected. Mother Gothel should have known better.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Most of the Villagers are stuck in their Houses by this blasted curse. Ursula and I were able to break free only because we cast some magic of our own to ward it off.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
To break this curse, we'll have to restore the Pillar of Trust... but that may come at a terrible cost.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
I know of a spell that could work, but it's dangerous. It demands sacrifices you may not be willing to make...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
The spell will take you to another place... somewhere between <Lore>Here and There</Lore>, where the <ActivityItem>Orb of Trust</ActivityItem> was hidden.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
It's not easy to get to, and it's dangerous to get stuck there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What is the Here and There?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Will I be able to come back?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What is the spell?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
It's a place between worlds, made of pure magic.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
In the <Lore>Here and There</Lore>, the laws that govern our world don't apply.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
One may pass through things and see things that shouldn't be seen...

TAG: Merlin_015_f
One might even take a leap of faith, and walk on air!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
But usually, things or people that go to the <Lore>Here and There</Lore> never come back to tell tales of what they've seen.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
The magic of the Pillar of Trust made whole again should be enough to summon you back to Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
We'll just have to hope the Sea Witch can be trusted.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
One for which <Lore>you'll need Ursula's help</Lore>. I'm afraid this type of magic is not my specialty.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Oh, I'll be watching Mother Gothel. The last thing we need around here is someone mucking about with curses and Dark Magic.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Splendid question!
