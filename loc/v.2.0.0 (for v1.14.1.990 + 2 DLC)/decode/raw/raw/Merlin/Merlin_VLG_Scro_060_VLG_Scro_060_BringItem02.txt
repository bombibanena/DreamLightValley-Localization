A magical map! Mm... yes, yes... let me see it.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Indeed! I've seen inscriptions of this sort before... The proper magic words should reveal what's written...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
HIGITUS, FIGITUS, DIGITUS, ZOE!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Ah, you see, the inscription says, "Only the one who wields the Lenses of Shadows shall find what's hidden in the Here and There."

TAG: Merlin_013_f
"Find the keys and make them whole for the treasure to be yours to hold."

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The keys?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Lenses of Shadows?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Another riddle...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Precisely! It seems you must find two parts of the same key and repair it somehow.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Oh yes. Scrooge kept something like that in safe keeping when the Forgetting happened. You should speak to him.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Don't fret, {PlayerName}. Magic is full of mysteries and riddles to solve!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Now, take the map back, and focus your magic on it. It will reveal its true form to you.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
As I mentioned, ask Scrooge about the <ActivityItem>Lenses of Shadows</ActivityItem>. He might remember something.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
And repair the key. You'll need it!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Look for two pieces of the same key. You'll need to repair it somehow.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
The <ActivityItem>Lenses of Shadows</ActivityItem>... I remember Scrooge kept something like that in safe keeping when the Forgetting happened. You should speak to him.
