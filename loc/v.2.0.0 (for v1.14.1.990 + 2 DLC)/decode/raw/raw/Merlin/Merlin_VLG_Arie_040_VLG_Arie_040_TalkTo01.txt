Hmm? A <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> covered in carvings... or rather runes, as that's what these are.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Ariel found it near some sort of door in a cave near Dazzle Beach. Do you know what it is?

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Well, it's likely a key of some kind. But as for what might be behind the door, I can't be certain.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
You know, I've always thought there were people who walked this island long before any of us did. Dreamlight Valley is old, {PlayerName}. Very old.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Even older than you? No way!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
People? Who were they?

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I'll have you know that for a wizard, I'm barely a whippersnapper! Ahem...

TAG: Merlin_011_f
I haven't the faintest idea who the people were. <Lore>But these runes must have been their language</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
I've seen them in various spots around the Village, but I've only just begun to decipher their meaning. Let me see...

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Take your time.

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
Hurry it up.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Ah-ha! I believe I know what this says!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
The people who made this door wanted to be sure no one could pass through it alone. You'll need something from other Villagers to get inside.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
Tools?

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
Something magic?

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
We could all try pushing on it together!

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Tools? No, no, I'm afraid tools will do you no good.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
It seems the people who wrote these runes trusted only in <Lore>emotions</Lore> and the power of stories.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
To open the door, you'll have to enchant this <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> by filling it with <Lore>Fiery Passion</Lore>, <Lore>Seething Anger</Lore>, <Lore>Perfect Joy</Lore> and <Lore>Exuberant Excitement</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Huh? How do I do that?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Why, you simply find four Villagers and have them hold the <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> while they feel each emotion.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds like I have my work cut out for me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can't anything be simple around here?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Perhaps Ariel can help you figure out which Villagers best embody the emotions you're looking for.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
The beauty of the world lies in its complexity, my friend. Besides, this sounds like a rather fun mystery to solve.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Magic? Hm. Well, a magic of a sort, I suppose.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Pushing on it? No, no, I'm afraid all we'd do is throw our backs out.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Patience, {PlayerName}. Patience.
