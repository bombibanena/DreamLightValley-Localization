Remy! I'm helping Pumbaa solve a mystery... Can you tell me what his favorite foods are at your restaurant?

TAG: Remy_005_f
I'd be happy to! Let's see... since Timon and Pumbaa got back, Pumbaa's really loved the <Lore>Cheese Platter</Lore>, <Lore>Macaroni and Cheese</Lore>, and <Lore>Cheesecake</Lore>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So... Cheese EVERYTHING.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Pumbaa is living my dream life.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
What do all these things have in common?

TAG: Remy_008_f
Yep. Pretty much.

TAG: Remy_012_f
I think this is the clue I'm looking for. Pumbaa didn't eat ANY cheese in the jungle â and now he's eating lots and his body isn't happy about it.

TAG: Remy_009_f
I hate to say it but... he HAS had a bit of an effect on my customers. I don't want to stop him from dining at my place, but I do want to be respectful of everyone's experience.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Maybe we can find Pumbaa some cheese-free meals to enjoy?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
It's a win-win solution!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
No more aroma Ã  la Pumbaa.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Food without cheese seems pointless.

TAG: Remy_015_f
I like the way you think.

TAG: Remy_017_f
And I know just what to do!

TAG: Remy_018_f
First, we'll cook some <ActivityItem>Onion Puffs</ActivityItem>. Those have cheese in them, so we can test to see whether it's cheese that's really upsetting Pumbaa's digestion.

TAG: Remy_019_f
If we're right, we can make some <ActivityItem>Gingerbread Cookies</ActivityItem> to calm his stomach and some <ActivityItem>Roasted Asparagus</ActivityItem> to show him a delicious meal that's totally cheese-free!

TAG: Remy_020_f
You've got it, chef!

TAG: Remy_021_f
Here are the recipes you'll need. Good luck!

TAG: Remy_014_f
Right! So long, Eau de Fromage!

TAG: Remy_016_f
Trust me. There are LOTS of excellent dishes that don't include cheese.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Mine too. You should see how many incredible cheeses there are to try in France!

TAG: Remy_010_f
It's cheese, {PlayerName}! Pumbaa loves cheese â and I don't blame him. It's a staple of MANY fine cuisines.
