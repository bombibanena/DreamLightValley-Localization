Hey, Daisy! ... Are you mad at Pumbaa?

TAG: Daisy_002_f
What? Why, of course not! Pumbaa's one of the sweetest, gentlest Villagers here. Why would I be mad at him?

TAG: Daisy_003_f
He said you left as soon as he came into Chez Remy today...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You can be honest with me. What's up?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He was too embarrassed to ask you himself.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He might have anxiety.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Oh, I would never be ANYTHING but honest. That's called journalistic integrity.

TAG: Daisy_008_f
To be frank: Pumbaa and Timon both eat like wild animals.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They've never been in a restaurant before.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Doesn't seem like enough of a reason to leave.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
They ARE wild animals!

TAG: Daisy_011_f
I guess I hadn't thought of that. Maybe I'll drop by sometime and casually mention a few table manners.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
But manners aside, the real problem was Pumbaa's aroma. When he first got here, it wasn't noticeable at all.

TAG: Daisy_015_f
But after he started eating, something changed. He just started smelling like... Well, let's just say it's a smell even my most luxurious perfume couldn't cover up!

TAG: Daisy_016_f
Hm... Elsa said something similar. I better <Lore>ask Remy about this</Lore>. Maybe he has some insight.

TAG: Daisy_017_f
That's strange. I wonder what changed.

TAG: Daisy_018_f
Maybe I'll go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore> and see what she thinks. Thanks, Daisy!

TAG: Daisy_010_f
Maybe not...

TAG: Daisy_012_f
So are Simba and Nala, but they don't fling food all around them when they eat.

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Oh, no! Poor thing. I suppose I do owe him an explanation.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Poor thing. I'm so glad you're trying to help him feel better. I'll tell you what happened...
