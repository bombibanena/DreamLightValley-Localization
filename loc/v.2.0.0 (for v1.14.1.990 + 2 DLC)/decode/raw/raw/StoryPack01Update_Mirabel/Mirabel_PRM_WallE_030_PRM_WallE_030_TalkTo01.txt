{PlayerName}! Hola! ... Whoa, you look like you have something important on your mind.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
BuÃ±uelos! Did you happen to have any left over...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I came to see you!

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
I'm afraid I don't have any left. Turns out Goofy is a big fan!

TAG: Mirabel_021_f
They're going into their seasonal molt now. But it may take a few days for them to drop all the feathers I need.

TAG: Mirabel_022_f
So you'll have to check the <ActivityItem>Sunlit Plateau</ActivityItem> every now and then to see if you can find more feathers.

TAG: Mirabel_024_f
Oh! And I'll need <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Emeralds</ActivityItem> as well.

TAG: Mirabel_023_f
Can do!

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Fantastic! If Antonio were here, his animal friends could help...

TAG: Mirabel_025_f
But I know you've got this!

TAG: Mirabel_026_f
Yep. I've got Dreamlight Magic to help out.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Hmm. I guess I could make some myself. But they're better when we make them together.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Oh, gracias. We'll have to make some more together soon!

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Well, good thing I have something else to ask you.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
WALLÂ·E is planning a little shindig and would love for you to attend.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
You mean like a party? I love parties!

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
Oooh, but I would need you to help me with something first if I'm gonna be able to make it.

TAG: Mirabel_019_f
Sure! What do you need?

TAG: Mirabel_020_f
<ActivityItem>Sunbird Feathers</ActivityItem>!
