Hola, {PlayerName}! Hola, WALLÂ·E! What brings you to Mini-Casita?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You'll have to ask WALLÂ·E about that...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Just being neighborly!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We're here for the arepas!

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Right! Okay... that might be tricky.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
You're telling me!

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
He's been visiting for awhile and rooting around. Mostly in the trash...

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
He does love to collect all sorts of things.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
I'm pretty sure he's looking for something... and he really likes this metal handle. Why don't you and WALLÂ·E take it?

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
Maybe you can figure out what he's hoping to do.

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
Thanks! I'll show it to WALLÂ·E and see how he reacts.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
I'm sure WALLÂ·E has something particular in mind...

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Do you know what he wants?

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Honestly, I have no idea.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
Oooh! Sorry, I just ate the last one!

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Um, {PlayerName}, WALLÂ·E seems to be on a mission. Do you know what it is?
