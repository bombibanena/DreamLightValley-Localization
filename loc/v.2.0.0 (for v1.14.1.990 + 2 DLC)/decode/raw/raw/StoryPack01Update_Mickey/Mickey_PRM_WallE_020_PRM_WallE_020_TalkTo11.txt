Hi, Mickey. I was wondering... How are things going with Minnie?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Gosh, {PlayerName}, things have been great since you brought her back to the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll bet!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That Dreamlight Magnifier really came in handy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You sound like there's still something wrong...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Havin' Minnie here... I can't tell ya how much it means to me.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
There, uh... there's just one thing...

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Sometimes she still has trouble with her memories.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Most of 'em are back, but every once in a while, somethin' seems to be missing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sorry to hear it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's a common problem here.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I've got a few ideas for how to help...

TAG: Mickey_006_f
I just wish there was some way to remind her.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Remy was just telling me that food and memory are tightly linked.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
What if WALLÂ·E and I fix up some food for you and set up a nice romantic spot for your date night?

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Wow! That's a great idea, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mickey_010_f
You let Minnie know that we're planning something.

TAG: Mickey_011_f
And we'll take care of the rest: starting with ensuring that you have a romantic atmosphere with some <ActivityItem>High Beach Torches</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Hot dog! This'll be awesome!

TAG: Mickey_013_f
I guess you're right. Lucky for us, you're always around to help remind us.

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Gosh, I'd love to hear 'em.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Oh boy, did it ever!

TAG: Mickey_016_f
Really? How'd you know?

TAG: Mickey_017_f
It's all WALLÂ·E â he's boosting my matchmaking instincts with his cute outfit.
