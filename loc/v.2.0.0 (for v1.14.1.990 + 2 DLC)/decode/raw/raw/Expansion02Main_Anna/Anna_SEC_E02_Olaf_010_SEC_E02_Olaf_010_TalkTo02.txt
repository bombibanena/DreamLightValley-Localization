Sooooo, I heard Olaf's made a new friend.

TAG: Anna_001_f
The Lorekeeper! She and Olaf have really hit it off. But...

TAG: Anna_002_f
Uh-oh. There's a "but."

TAG: Anna_003_f
Do we need to remind Olaf about boundaries again?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think we just need to find Olaf another hobby.

The Lorekeeper's magic is waning and she needs her rest.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Hmm... Well, Olaf is fascinated with the Bind. Maybe we can find something to interest him just as much as talking to the Lorekeeper.

TAG: Anna_005_f
I'll look around and see if anything jumps out at me.

TAG: Anna_006_f
Good idea! While you're doing that, I'll <Lore>take some pictures</Lore> of things around the Bind that Olaf might find neat.
