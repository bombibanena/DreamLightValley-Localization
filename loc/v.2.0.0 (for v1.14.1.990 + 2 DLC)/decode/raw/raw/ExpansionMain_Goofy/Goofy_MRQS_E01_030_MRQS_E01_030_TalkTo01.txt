Aw fiddlesticks! Would ya look at that?

My Stalls aren't fancy places, but this one's a downright mess.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It just needs a little work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you need to get it up and running?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe the critters around here tore it apart...

TAG: Goofy_003_f
You're right, {PlayerName}!

Hmmm... Think we'll need some <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Plastic Scrap</ActivityItem> to fix it up.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
I'll get them for you.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
I think I saw some <ActivityItem>Plastic Scrap</ActivityItem> floating in the water outside of the ripples!

TAG: Goofy_007_f
And I'll bet the <Lore>Mining Rocks</Lore> around here have plenty of <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem> in them!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Welp, I'm sure if they did, it wasn't on purpose. Let's try and fix it.
