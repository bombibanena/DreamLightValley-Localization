Gawrsh, {PlayerName}, where'd you find this old sign?

TAG: Player_000_f
I found it in Ancient's Landing on Eternity Isle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You must have had a Stall there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Does it ring a bell?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You really do have Stalls EVERYWHERE, huh?

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Ya know, I think I did!

TAG: Goofy_006_f
I remember now...

TAG: Goofy_000_f
I tried to bring my Stalls to Eternity Isle, but just as I was about to start sellin' stuff...

TAG: Goofy_002_f
...the Forgetting started, and I went back to Dreamlight Valley to help my friends.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Well, maybe we could finish what you started back then and open it!

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Great idea! Let's start with the one in Ancient's Landing. C'mon; let's go see what it looks like.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Welp, now that ya mention it, it sure does!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
A-hyuck! I guess I do.
