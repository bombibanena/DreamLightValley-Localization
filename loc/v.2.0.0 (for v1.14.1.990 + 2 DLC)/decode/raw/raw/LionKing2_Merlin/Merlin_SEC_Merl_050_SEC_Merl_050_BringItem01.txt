How was battling the infestation with Timon and Pumbaa?

Bug hunting is intense.

I never want to see a bug again. EVER.

Given the multitude of mites you've delivered to me, I should say so. Your teamwork has saved the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
While you were catching the Night Mites, I was working on a cleansing enchantment to ensure they are safe enough to eat. And I've succeeded!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Which means I have a banquet for our heroes! Please <Lore>place this feast somewhere in the Valley</Lore>. And thank you for saving our Valley, once again.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Intense but worthwhile. And it seems to be one of your many talents, judging by the multitude of mites you just gave me.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Yes, they can be a bit disturbing to some. Well, while I cannot guarantee you've seen the last of ANY insect here, this delivery will be the last you see of the mites... More or less.

More or less?
