What a peculiar specimen... The same coloration and magical vibration as the Night Thorns, and yet...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
And yet I... I... What was I saying?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The bugs look like Night Thorns!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh no, did that thing just affect your memory?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I do NOT like this one bit!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Indeed? I, well... Oh dear...

TAG: Merlin_006_f
I theorize that these particular insects either come FROM Night Thorns, or are drawn TO them.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Either way, these... ahem... "Night Mites" seem to be miniature vectors of the Forgetting!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I must put this one in a magic-proof jar straight away! And you must <Lore>speak to our best insect catchers</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
We have no time to lose! Where there is one insect, there are ALWAYS more!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Did it? It seems it did... Oh dear...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Nor do I... I... Oof! I forgot what I was saying in the middle of a thought!
