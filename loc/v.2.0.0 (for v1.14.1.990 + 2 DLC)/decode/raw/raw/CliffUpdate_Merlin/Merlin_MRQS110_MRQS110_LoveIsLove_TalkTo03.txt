Ah, {PlayerName}! Tell me: What did you find at the center of the blizzard?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
I found a secret chamber full of strange magical experiments. I think that I must have made it back before the Forgetting...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
How curious. I wonder what purpose it served.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Oh, and that's not all. I found Olaf inside!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Olaf! Oh, wonderful! Was the loquacious little snowman helpful in sorting out our magical conundrum?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes! He's helping me find the Orb.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not sure yet. I need some more help with this mystery.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not really. He got me to chase some squirrels around.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Brilliant! I've always known that Olaf possesses unexpected wisdom. What did he tell you?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Olaf's arms are missing. He says that the last thing he remembers is that they were holding on to the Orb.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
But he doesn't know where to find them. He said something about... water having memory?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
He's quite right, you know.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
That was one of the powers your Royal Watering Can used to have. It could <Lore>draw out the memories held by water</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Do you think my Watering Can still has that power...? Maybe we could find out exactly what happened to the Orb. But I wouldn't know where to start.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
It's always best to start off where something has begun. <Lore>Investigate the Pillar in the Frosted Heights.</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Hold out your Watering Can and <Lore>focus your magic</Lore>. If there's anything to be found, that should help you find it.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Well, I've always known that Olaf possesses unexpected wisdom. What did he tell you?

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Oh dear. That's not the best use of time when a magical blizzard is threatening to destroy the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Still, I've always known that Olaf possesses unexpected wisdom. Surely he said something that could be of help?
