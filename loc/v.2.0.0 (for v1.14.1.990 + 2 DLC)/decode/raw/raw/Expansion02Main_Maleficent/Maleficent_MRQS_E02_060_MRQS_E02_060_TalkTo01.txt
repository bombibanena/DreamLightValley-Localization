Well, what have we here?

TAG: Maleficent_003_f
Someone foolish enough to barge into my home uninvited?

TAG: Maleficent_004_f
Do you have even the faintest clue whose wrath you are courting?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Soooo, not going to lie. I'm EXTREMELY afraid of you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Mistress of All Evil... I come to you, humbly, to beg for aid.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Cut the threats. You don't scare me.

TAG: Maleficent_005_f
Good. Then you're not as foolish as I thought.

TAG: Maleficent_015_f
Tell me what brings you to my home.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm here to stop the Neverafter.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm here to resolve the feud between you and Hades.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I wanted some style tips. I love your clothes and general vibe.

TAG: Maleficent_016_f
The Neverafter? Why, whatever could you mean?

TAG: Player_002_f
Help me solve all this and...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...I'll make sure no one bothers you.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...we'll put Hades in his place.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...I'll be a loyal servant to you.

TAG: Maleficent_020_f
Ink bursting out of the ground? The Lorekeeper's pages being scattered? Pieces of your castle showing up all over Everafter?

TAG: Maleficent_021_f
How interesting. But that's really none of my concern. There is always something going wrong in this miserable world.

TAG: Maleficent_017_f
Wait... you really don't know what's going on outside your castle?

TAG: Maleficent_019_f
It's not that I lack the knowledge. It's that I simply do not care.

TAG: Maleficent_009_f
For once, it's been mercifully quiet.

TAG: Maleficent_010_f
No fools trying to steal from me.

TAG: Maleficent_011_f
No self-righteous wizard, passing judgments.

TAG: Maleficent_012_f
And best of all? No Hades.

TAG: Maleficent_028_f
Hmm... A tempting offer.

TAG: Maleficent_049_f
If you <Lore>set things right in here</Lore>, I'll allow you passage into my throne room.

TAG: Maleficent_038_f
Got it. <Lore>Clean things up in here, then put my Royal Net to work in your throne room</Lore>!

TAG: Maleficent_039_f
I look forward to seeing you try. My pets will prove most difficult to catch.

TAG: Maleficent_040_f
When you fail, I will enjoy keeping you here, as my new servant.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
And if I succeed?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Not gonna happen.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
That doesn't sound so bad.

TAG: Maleficent_031_f
I suppose, if you agree to do a little chore for me, and Hades begs my forgiveness...

TAG: Maleficent_032_f
...something could be arranged.

TAG: Maleficent_033_f
What's the chore?

TAG: Maleficent_034_f
I have pets that have gotten loose and brought chaos to my castle.

TAG: Maleficent_035_f
Now that I consider it, the chaos outside began at almost the same time. Perhaps they're connected.

TAG: Maleficent_036_f
In any case, my pets seem to have grown too powerful to be contained, even by MY magic.

TAG: Maleficent_037_f
I've locked it inside my throne room, but not before it caused havoc everywhere.

TAG: Maleficent_048_f
It scattered furniture throughout my castle. And I cannot abide disorganization.

TAG: Maleficent_041_f
You won't.

TAG: Maleficent_042_f
But if you do, you will be the rarest thing in this wretched world...

TAG: Maleficent_043_f
...a mortal who has earned my respect.

TAG: Maleficent_050_f
Begin by <Lore>finding my missing furniture and placing it back where it belongs</Lore>.

TAG: Maleficent_044_f
Well then, prove that I am wrong.

TAG: Maleficent_046_f
If you do, you will be the rarest thing in this wretched world...

TAG: Maleficent_045_f
Yes, it would be an honor for you, wouldn't it?

TAG: Maleficent_047_f
Best of luck, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Maleficent_029_f
Now, that would be quite satisfying.

TAG: Maleficent_030_f
Hmm... I could use a new servant. I seem to have misplaced my most recent one... that fool, Flynn Rider...

TAG: Maleficent_018_f
Your feud is causing a mess around the Storybook Vale.

TAG: Maleficent_022_f
Why, whatever could you mean?

TAG: Maleficent_024_f
... Are you mocking me?

TAG: Maleficent_025_f
Huh? No, not at all, I'mâ

TAG: Maleficent_026_f
I shall grant you one more chance. What REALLY made you fool enough to sneak into my castle?

TAG: Maleficent_027_f
Okay, okay. I came here because of the Neverafter and your feud with Hades. You two are causing a mess around the Vale.

TAG: Maleficent_006_f
Oh. You have manners. That might save you from my wrath. But not for long, if you don't explain yourself.

TAG: Maleficent_007_f
Really? Oh, you are an amusing one, aren't you?

TAG: Maleficent_008_f
Perhaps I'll keep you as a pet, just like the other one I've imprisoned here.

TAG: Maleficent_013_f
But first... tell me, what was so important that you would risk your life by coming here to face me?
