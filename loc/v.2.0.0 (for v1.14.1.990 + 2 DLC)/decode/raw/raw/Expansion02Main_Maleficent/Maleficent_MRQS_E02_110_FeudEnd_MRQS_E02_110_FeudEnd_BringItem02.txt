Why, what's this?

TAG: Maleficent_002_f
Some sort of invitation?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We humbly request your attendance...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Look! It's got green flame and everything!

TAG: Maleficent_010_f
My attendance where?

TAG: Maleficent_012_f
Ink is still spilling all over the Vale. We need YOUR help to stop the Neverafter.

TAG: Maleficent_000_f
We invite you to the first meeting of the <Lore>Grand Council of the Neverafter</Lore>.

TAG: Maleficent_013_f
Please meet us in the Library of Lore.

TAG: Maleficent_003_f
You want me to descend from my castle and mingle with the rabble?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
We NEED your help, Maleficent. We can't do it without you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do it or don't do it. It's up to you.

TAG: Maleficent_014_f
I suppose you are all hopelessly lost without me, aren't you?

TAG: Maleficent_016_f
I've only one question...

TAG: Maleficent_017_f
Will Hades be there?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yes, he will.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maybe...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
If I say he is, are you not going to show up?

TAG: Maleficent_018_f
Ahhhh! You want me to waste a moment more in the presence of that fool?!

TAG: Maleficent_006_f
Put aside your feud with Hades, just for now, please. You'll be the REAL guest of honor.

TAG: Maleficent_004_f
Put aside MY feud? Hades STARTED all of this.

TAG: Maleficent_005_f
He put a curse on my castle. The ink appeared here before anywhere else in the Vale.

TAG: Maleficent_007_f
That's strange. Hades told me that YOU started the feud, and that the ink started appearing on Mount Olympus first.

TAG: Maleficent_019_f
And you believe that fiery fool? You are far more naÃ¯ve than I thought, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Maleficent_009_f
Still... I will attend your little gathering and help you set the Vale right. But only so that I may remind everyone who is the rightful ruler of the Vale.

TAG: Maleficent_008_f
Hades cursed your castle? That's weird.

TAG: Maleficent_020_f
I'll ask him about it.

TAG: Maleficent_021_f
If you think you can trust anything that fiery fool says, you are far more naÃ¯ve than I thought.

TAG: Maleficent_015_f
We invite you to join the <Lore>Guardians of the Vale</Lore>.

TAG: Maleficent_022_f
We invite you to join <Lore>the Lorekeeper's Legion</Lore>.

TAG: Maleficent_011_f
An impressive parlor trick, no doubt, but what is the meaning of it?
