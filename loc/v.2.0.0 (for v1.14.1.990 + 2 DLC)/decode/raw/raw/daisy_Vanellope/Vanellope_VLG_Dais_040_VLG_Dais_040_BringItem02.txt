Uh... What's this?

Daisy's answer to your question. She thinks a change of wardrobe will help you "take it to the next level" and make you feel "like a boss" like you asked.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
This is bonkers! When I said I wanted to level up and be more like a boss, I thought she'd teach me how to investigate mysteries? Run a business?

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Sheesh, even tying knots that never come undone like she does with her bows!

TAG: Vanellope_000_f
I definitely didn't mean a makeover!

I think it's a great dress.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Does that mean you won't wear it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I tried to warn Daisy about this!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Sure, it's nice, {PlayerName}, but eh... It's just not me. And I love being me!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
I love my candy-sprinkled hair, and my comfy clothes, and my adorable face that gets super intense when I'm leaving my competitors in the dust!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Hey... look at me being all sure of myself. Sweet mother of monkey milk!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Maybe this DID help me reach a new level? Just... not how Daisy thought.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Nah, it's really not my speed.

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Aw, it's nice to have a friend who knows me so well! It's a cool outfit and all, but it's just not me. And I LIKE being me.
