Oh! Look at that... glitter. Everywhere! Whatever could have happened?

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Seems someone planted a glitter bomb to prank the gala. Would you know anything about that?

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Who, me? I'm just an innocent, adorable little kid enjoying some cheesecake.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You expect me to believe that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who do you think is responsible?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Lie better, Vanellope.

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
You seemed really REALLY bored...

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
No! I had my eyes closed. I was trying to mess with the photo because I knew it would drive Daisy bonkers.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm keeping an eye on you...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I didn't learn anything useful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You are SO suspicious!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Hey! Being bored isn't a crime. I'll tell you who's REALLY responsible for this glitter disaster... Minnie!

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Minnie?

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Yeah, she looks all spice and everything nice, but she's a mastermind, and she actually LIKES glitter. It must be her or... Kristoff.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Don't you think it's weird he's so calm, like all the time?! If you ask me, he's hiding something.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Or what about Donald?

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
What ABOUT Donald?

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
He could've easily tripped and exploded something with glitter inside. Clumsy city, am I right?

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Sounds like you're guessing... Or covering something up. You didn't see anything?

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
You can keep BOTH eyes on me, {PlayerName}. Just remember the culprit is anyone BUT me.

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Great!

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
Waitâ Uh-oh.

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
Me? Pfff, {PlayerName}, don't be ridiculous. I'm a perfectly innocent little kid.
