Hey Minnie, I'm helping Pumbaa put his best hoof forward to eat at Chez Remy. Do you have anything I could use to help freshen his breath?

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Oh, Daisy told me about poor Pumbaa. I'll do anything I can to help. Let me think...

Well, when I was trapped in the Here and There for... oh, I don't know how long... I couldn't brush my teeth at all! I'm not sure I even had teeth, really.

But when I got back to the Valley, I couldn't get the taste of radishes out of my mouth.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's so weird!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is that a... bad thing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Radishes ARE pretty ethereal...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Isn't it?

TAG: Minnie_007_f
The only thing that got rid of the taste was chewing fresh <Lore>Mint from the Frosted Heights</Lore>.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Mint leaves are a great idea! Thank you, Minnie!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
I do like radishes, especially pickled ones!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
But that taste got a little frustrating after a while.

All vegetables are, if you think about it. A beautiful tomato coming from a tiny seed? How magical!
