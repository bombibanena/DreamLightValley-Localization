Hey, Minnie! I'm putting together a pottery class for Pumbaa. He's REALLY excited about trying something new. Any thoughts on what we might need?

Oh, that sounds like fun!

Now, let's see... you'll need some <ActivityItem>Pottery Wheels</ActivityItem>. Even if Pumbaa and his guests don't end up using them, you'll want to have the option.

You'll also need clay and glazes to add a touch of color!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll find everything, no problem!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you do lots of pottery?

The image of Pumbaa using a pottery wheel is too cute!

I'll go talk to Pumbaa and see if there's anything else I can help with.

Well, Daisy and I took a class once. She felt it was a little messy, but I had a marvelous time!

TAG: Minnie_007_f
I agree! I can't wait to see what he comes up with.

It's so exciting to see a new artist get their start.
