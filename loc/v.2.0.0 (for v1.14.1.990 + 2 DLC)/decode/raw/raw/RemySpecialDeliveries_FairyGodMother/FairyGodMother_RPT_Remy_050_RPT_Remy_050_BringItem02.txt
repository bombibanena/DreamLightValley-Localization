Oh, thank you for delivering these delicious treats, dear!

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
I just know my guests will love your pumpkin dishes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No problem! Enjoy!

Anything else you need a hand with?

What's this I hear about a pumpkin party?

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
If you've a moment... I would like to ask for one more favor.

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
In my excitement to put everything together for my pumpkin party, I'm afraid I forgot one very important thing...

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
...to send out the invitations!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I could invite some Villagers!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why not just send out some enchanted invitations?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That part is kind of crucial for a party.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Oh, would you, dear? I'd be most grateful.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
For my inaugural party, I'd like to invite <Lore>Vanellope, Stitch, Olaf, Elsa, and Minnie</Lore>.

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
After all, what matters most is not cake, favors, or other odds and ends...

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
...but rather a welcoming atmosphere and many good friends!

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Oh, enchanted invitations can be a bit tricky. They're known to wander and get themselves into trouble.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
It would be much simpler if you could ask some of the Villagers for me.

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
Of course it is, dear.

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
I don't suppose you could help me by inviting some Villagers?

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
How kind of you to ask. And, yes, I could use your help with something...

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
Yes, it's a new idea I've had that I hope will become a tradition. It's just... I'm afraid I have a bit of a problem, which I was hoping you could help with.
