Oh, {PlayerName}, these desserts look scrumptious!

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
I'm sure Ursula will be most pleased with them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ursula?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you and Ursula friends?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I hope you didn't get sucked into a deal with her.

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
That's right, dear.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
You see, she was telling me the other day how unappreciated she feels...

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
...and how sure she is that no one ever does an act of kindness for another without wanting something in return.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
I'm hoping this will show her that's simply not true.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How thoughtful!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm sure Ursula will appreciate it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're wasting your time trying to be nice to her.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
That's kind of you to say.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Now, off you go. Don't delay! Show Ursula that kindness is always the way.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
That's my wish.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Oh, {PlayerName}. You ought to know that no gift is ever wasted. Giving is itself a marvelous reward.

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
I'll simply say that I'm hoping one day Ursula will see that a friend is a wonderful thing to be.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
A deal? Oh no, nothing like that.
