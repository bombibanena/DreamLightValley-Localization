Ugh, no... not HIM again!

TAG: Ursula_001_f
This is Jack Skellington! I guess... you two have already met.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Unfortunately.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
... And how did that go?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Well, he barged into my home earlier today.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
At first I thought he was looking to make a deal...

TAG: Ursula_006_f
...but he went straight to my potions, grabbed several, and started mixing them together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But you worked so hard on your collection!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
... I wish that surprised me.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Precisely. At least someone recognizes all my hard work.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
That menace kept asking where I kept my frog's breath...

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Then he mixed Kraken's Ink with Steam Vent Salt...

TAG: Ursula_011_f
I'm just glad I had some Essence of Moonlit Kelp handy to stop my whole House from going up in smoke.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh no!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I didn't know that was even possible.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He's just interested in your craft.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Oh yes!

TAG: Ursula_015_f
I want to make this right â what potions did he ruin?

TAG: Ursula_016_f
{PlayerName}, angelfish, though you do have your strengths with Dreamlight Magic...

TAG: Ursula_017_f
...the kind of potions I make are far beyond you.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
Still, you can fetch me some Ingredients, and as long as that nuisance is properly reprimanded, I suppose we can put this behind us.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
Oh trust me, I'll talk to him about it. What do you need?

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Bring me <ActivityItem>Gooseberry</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Red Nasturtium Flowers</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>White Passion Lilies</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Amethysts</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_021_f
I'm on it!

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Neither did I â potions seem to react oddly to his presence.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Well, next time he can ask and offer something in exchange, or I'll turn him into a skinny stalk of seaweed for my garden.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Oh, you know about his tendency for rudeness?
