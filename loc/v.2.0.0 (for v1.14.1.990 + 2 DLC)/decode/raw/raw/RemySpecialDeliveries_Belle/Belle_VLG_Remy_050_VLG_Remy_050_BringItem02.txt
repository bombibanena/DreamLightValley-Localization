What's the special occasion?

TAG: Belle_002_f
Remy's starting a service in the Village for special deliveries.

You could order a special dinner for you and the Beast!

Maybe you can get some of that delicious gray stuff on the go?

TAG: Belle_003_f
That's a wonderful idea! I'll be sure to order something soon.

Now, if only we could get some sort of service like this in the Village for books.

I'd like that. It's become one of my favorite treats.
