Gawrsh, {PlayerName}, am I glad to see you.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
I got kind of a problem... Ursula offered to enchant one of my fishing rods if I agreed to bring her some seaweed and red algae...

TAG: Goofy_004_f
But then, right after I signed her contract, I got nervous. I tried to catch all the stuff she asked for in a hurry.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Then what went wrong?

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Welp, my enchanted fishing rod broke! And now I've been having terrible luck.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Ursula's not too happy about it. She's even talkin' about adding me to her garden!

TAG: Player_000_f
I'll help you. Let's fix your <ActivityItem>Enchanted Fishing Rod</ActivityItem> first...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I can't leave you in this situation.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
For the sake of the Village's peace.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Ursula deserves to be paid.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Goofy_011_f
To fix it, I'm gonna need <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Tinkering Parts</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
You're right. She did hold up her side of the bargain.
