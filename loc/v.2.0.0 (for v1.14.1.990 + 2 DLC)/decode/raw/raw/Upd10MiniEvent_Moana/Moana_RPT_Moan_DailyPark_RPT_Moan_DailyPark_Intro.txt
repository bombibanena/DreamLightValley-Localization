Hi {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What's up?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm a little busy to talk now.

TAG: Moana_008_f
{PlayerName}, I'm glad I found you!

TAG: Moana_011_f
I was hoping we could give the other Villagers another festival treat.

TAG: Moana_012_f
Everyone really loves those <ActivityItem>Princess Aurora Cupcakes</ActivityItem> you made.

TAG: Moana_013_f
There's something about that tart raspberry flavor with the sweetness that just kind of makes you smile.

TAG: Moana_014_f
Do you think you could make another batch? And could you help me share them with the Villagers?

TAG: Moana_009_f
Oh, {PlayerName}! Do you think you could make some more <ActivityItem>Princess Aurora Cupcakes</ActivityItem> so we can give them to the Villagers?

TAG: Moana_015_f
My father always says a leader should make sure that others have enough to eat before worrying about themselves.

TAG: Moana_016_f
I don't think he has cupcakes in mind, but the lesson about sharing is the same!

TAG: Moana_017_f
Would you like to help me do something fun to celebrate the Dreamlight Parks Fest?

TAG: Moana_018_f
I was thinking we could make more of those <ActivityItem>Princess Aurora Cupcakes</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_019_f
I don't know Princess Aurora, or maybe that's just the Forgetting. But whoever she is, she has great taste in cupcakes!

TAG: Moana_020_f
Could you bake some and help me hand out these cupcakes?

TAG: Moana_001_f
Are you enjoying the festival?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Dreamlight Parks Fest is great.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Who doesn't love a celebration?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I haven't had a chance to celebrate!

TAG: Moana_002_f
I agree! There's so much to do and see. It feels like we've voyaged to another Valley!

TAG: Moana_005_f
One of my favorite things about the festival BEFORE the Forgetting, were these special cakes...

TAG: Moana_006_f
Everyone called them <ActivityItem>Princess Aurora Cupcakes<ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_021_f
I'd never had raspberries until I got here. And the cakes were so bright and delicious!

TAG: Moana_007_f
Now, the tradition is that we share them with the other Villagers.

TAG: Moana_023_f
Do you think you could help me with that? Oh, and be sure to come see me afterwards. I have something special for you.

TAG: Moana_003_f
Right?! On Motunui we have all kinds of different celebrations.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Well, I have a fun way to get into the spirit of things, if you're interested.

TAG: Moana_010_f
Okay, I understand. Maybe later then?
