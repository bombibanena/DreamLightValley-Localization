Hm. If I find more of Remy's recipes, maybe I could...

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Oh boy! We did it! We found the Shovel, and the recipe for... for...

TAG: Mickey_008_f
...<ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>? Oh. Heh-heh.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
All this trouble... over fruit salad?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
I'm just excited to get cooking!

TAG: Mickey_000_f
Is it, like, some kinda... magic fruit salad or something?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Well, all of Remy's recipes taste magical. Even the simple ones!

TAG: Mickey_014_f
And I bet if you keep looking, you'll find some recipes that are a bit more exciting.

TAG: Mickey_012_f
I know Remy would trust you with his recipes. And I'm pretty sure you'll like making 'em.

...keep my Energy up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
...share them with my friends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
...start my own restaurant and get rich.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Smart thinking! A good meal can really keep you goin' when you're running around fixing up the Valley!

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Now, before you start collecting other recipes, we gotta make this one first.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
First we'll have to <Lore>gather the Ingredients.</Lore> I'll go see what I've got in my garden.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Meet me there when you want to make the <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>! It's been so long since I tasted one of Remy's recipes, I can't wait to try it!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Oh, and here are some overalls for you to wear if you want to look the part for what comes next: gardening!

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Yeah! The only thing better than a tasty meal is a tasty meal shared with a friend.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Ha-ha! You sound like Donald's Uncle Scrooge!

TAG: Mickey_013_f
I'm sure all of Remy's recipes taste great. Even the easy ones!

TAG: Mickey_011_f
You said it! Remy knows how to add a little bit of magic to even the simplest dish!
