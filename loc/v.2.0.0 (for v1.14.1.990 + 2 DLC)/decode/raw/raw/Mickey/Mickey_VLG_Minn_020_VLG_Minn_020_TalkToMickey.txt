Floating and sparkling, huh? That's kinda how Minnie looked when she was lost.

Hot dog! What can I do to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Could we borrow the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Magnifier</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you think these things are stuck in the Here and There?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Of course! Here, take it!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Maybe. You should take the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Magnifier</ActivityItem> and see if it helps.
