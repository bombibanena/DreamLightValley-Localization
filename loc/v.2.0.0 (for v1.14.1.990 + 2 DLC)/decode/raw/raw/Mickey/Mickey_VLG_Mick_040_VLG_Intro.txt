{PlayerName}! I've got an idea for how we can bring Minnie back for good!

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Can you help me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure! What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't help you right now!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

According to Merlin, Minnie's Bow has enough Memories to bring her back.

The thing we have to do is stop her from disappearing again!

So Merlin invented something new. It's called the Dreamlight Magnifier.

We can build it ourselves. We just need some materials...

TAG: Mickey_007_f
...a few Tinkering Parts, some wood, and an Emerald.

And, of course, Minnie's Bow, which I've got right here.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Gotcha. Please come back as soon as you can! We have to help Minnie!
