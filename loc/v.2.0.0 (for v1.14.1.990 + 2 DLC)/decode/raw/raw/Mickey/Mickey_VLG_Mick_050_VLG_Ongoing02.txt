Well, the full riddle goes...

TAG: Mickey_001_f
"Turrets and towers you will behold. Within: a door for things new and old."

TAG: Mickey_002_f
"It needs no key you've ever known. To open this door, find matching stones."

I'm not sure what stones it's talking about. Maybe the Memory you found holds some clues.
