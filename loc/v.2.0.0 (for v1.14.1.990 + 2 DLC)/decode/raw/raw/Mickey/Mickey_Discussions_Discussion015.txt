Mickey, you took care of all the gardening around the Village for a long time.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Do you have any tips?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Oh, gosh. Let me think...

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Oh! I got one! Certain crops seem to grow a lot faster in certain parts of the Valley.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Hm... I guess it must be the climate and soil...

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Yep. So if you wanna grow a lot of vegetables fast, you've gotta start lots of gardens all over the Village.

Just keep planting things and harvesting 'em. I bet you'll get the hang of it soon.
