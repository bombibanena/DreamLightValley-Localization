Remember when we saw Minnie for a moment at the picnic? I've been thinking...

TAG: Mickey_000_f
I might know why it happened. And how to make it happen again!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't help right now; I'm sorry.

TAG: Mickey_022_f
Minnie appeared when I was thinking about the picnics we used to have.

TAG: Mickey_023_f
I talked to Merlin, and he says it's all about remembering her!

TAG: Mickey_024_f
So, he enchanted Minnie's favorite bow. He calls it a Memory Magnet.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
So we hold the bow and remember her?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Sounds far-fetched.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Minnie's lost and alone. Do you really think she'll care about a bow?

TAG: Mickey_025_f
Exactly!

TAG: Mickey_026_f
Come on; let's try it together. I remember that Minnie loves wearing...

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
...stripes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
...polka dots!

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
...stars!

TAG: Mickey_029_f
Actually, Minnie loves polka dots best.

TAG: Mickey_032_f
Let's see... What else does she love?

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
Flowers!

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
Baking!

TAG: Player_000_choice_011_f
Giggling!

TAG: Mickey_034_f
You're right! Minnie loves watching flowers bloom.

TAG: Mickey_037_f
You know, you kinda remind me of her.

TAG: Mickey_038_f
Once she even formed a club with Woody and Annaâ

TAG: Mickey_039_f
Whoa! Minnie's Bow... It's tingling!

TAG: Mickey_040_f
I think it's working! Here, take Minnie's Bow, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mickey_041_f
If you go talk to more Villagers, we can charge it up with more Memories!

TAG: Mickey_042_f
Be sure you come back and see me when you're done.

TAG: Mickey_035_f
She sure does! And she always tells me the most important ingredient in any recipe is love.

TAG: Mickey_036_f
You got it! She loves to laugh!

TAG: Mickey_030_f
That's right! Minnie LOVES polka dots!

TAG: Mickey_031_f
Well, we both like LOOKING at the stars together.

TAG: Mickey_033_f
But she doesn't WEAR a lot of stars. She likes wearing polka dots best!

TAG: Mickey_027_f
Well, magic can be kinda strange, but I trust Merlin! He's a very wise wizard.

TAG: Mickey_028_f
Trust me: Wherever she is, Minnie will want her favorite bow. She really loves it.

TAG: Mickey_020_f
That's okay. I'll talk to you later. Come back quick!
