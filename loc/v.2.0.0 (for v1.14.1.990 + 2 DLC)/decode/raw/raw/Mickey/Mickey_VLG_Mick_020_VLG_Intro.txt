Gosh, I miss Minnie. I know we'll get her back here one day.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
I just wish that "one day" was today.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I understand. She means a lot to you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Tell me more about Minnie.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You need a distraction!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
She sure does! A guy couldn't ask for a sweeter sweetheart. *sigh* I miss all the things we used to do together.

Like singing songs and going on picnics... Say, maybe we could go on a picnic to honor one of Minnie's favorite things!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
She'd really like that.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
How 'bout you get the food, and I'll get everything else?

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Aw, Minnie's just about the kindest girl you could meet. She always makes sure everybody's happy.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Hey, I know! Let's do something she'd love! It would make her real happy if we did one of her favorite things.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
And I know just what it should be â a picnic!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Maybe you're right... I know! Let's have a picnic!

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Meet me in the Peaceful Meadow when you're ready!
