Aw, I bet Minnie would love this. The sky, the grass...

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Wait â Merlin and I saw something like this before. {PlayerName}, Minnie isn't gone!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What is it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've seen Minnie appearing and disappearing before too!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
It's just her kind of picnic.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
And I know she'd love being friends with you.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Gosh, I miss her...

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Mickey... I think something is happening...

TAG: Mickey_006_f
...!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Wow! Is that Minnie?!

TAG: Mickey_000_f
Was that really her? Where is she?

TAG: Mickey_008_f
It must be the Forgetting! It's not just memories that are lost.

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Villagers are starting to fade away too!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
We have to figure out how to bring Minnie back to the Valley!

TAG: Mickey_013_f
And with your help, I'm sure we can do it.

TAG: Mickey_014_f
I need to go check in with Merlin.

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Let's talk about this again soon!

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Was that what you tried to tell me earlier?
