Hot dog! It's all coming back to me now. Dreamlight Valley used to be full of friends!

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Like my pal, Remy. He was always tryin' out new recipes.

TAG: Mickey_022_f
And I was always happy to taste 'em! Ha-ha!

TAG: Mickey_023_f
I also remember, when Remy had to leave...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
...he left me all his <Lore>Recipes</Lore> to keep safe for him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Who's Remy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why did he leave?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Where are they?

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Oh, Remy's a great chef who runs the best restaurant in town!

TAG: Mickey_019_f
Or he did until the Night Thorns started infesting Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Mickey_020_f
I buried his recipes all over the Valley to keep 'em safe.

TAG: Mickey_024_f
It uh... Well, it seemed like the best idea at the time. Ha-ha.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Hot dog! You found the Shovel! Now that you have it, there's one recipe we can get right now.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Making meals will keep your Energy up while you help save the Valley.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
The <ActivityItem>Memory</ActivityItem> you found should give us a clue as to where we can find the recipe.

TAG: Mickey_000_f
Hey, I've got an idea! Remy's recipes could help you make meals to keep your Energy up while you help save the Valley.

TAG: Mickey_025_f
There's one recipe we can get right now.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
'Cause the Night Thorns came and everyone started to forget.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
I hid 'em all over the Valley, hopin' to protect 'em from the Forgetting.
