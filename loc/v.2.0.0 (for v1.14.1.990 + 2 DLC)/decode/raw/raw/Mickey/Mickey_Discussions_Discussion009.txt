Say {PlayerName}, do you have any friends who have a short temper?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A few.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No... All my friends are very calm.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There is Donald Duck.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Gosh, I think everybody knows somebody with a short fuse. Like my friend Donald Duck.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
When he thinks something's not fair or somebody's being treated badly, he can get real mad real fast.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
What do you do when that happens?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Empathize with them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Give them space.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I'm not sure.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
You mean you let your friend know you understand why they're angry?

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Wow, that's real nice. I bet they appreciate that.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
That's probably smart. I know Donald never stays mad for long.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
You sure are a great friend, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Yeah, sometimes it's hard to know. With Donald, I've found that the best thing to do is just give him some space. Of course, if I can fix whatever he's mad about, that helps, too.

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Then I guess you haven't met Donald Duck yet! Ha-ha! But don't worry. He's a great guy. I couldn't ask for a better friend.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
That's just who I was thinking about.
