Gosh, it sure is great to have you in the Village, {playerName}!

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Things were pretty scary before you got here...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
And some places are still a little scary.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
I tried to protect the Valley by myself, but it wasn't very easy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You did the best you could.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This wasn't your fault.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess you just have to try to do better next time.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Thanks! I suppose that's all anybody can do.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
If everybody's coming home, I want to give 'em a Valley they can really be proud of!

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Say, the Valley used to be full of singing birds. I wonder if we could get them to come back...

TAG: Mickey_008_f
I know, let's make a birdhouse!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
We'll need flowers and some wood.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Aw, I know. But it's sad seein' Night Thorns where there used to be flowers.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
I'll do you one better: I'll make sure there IS no next time!
