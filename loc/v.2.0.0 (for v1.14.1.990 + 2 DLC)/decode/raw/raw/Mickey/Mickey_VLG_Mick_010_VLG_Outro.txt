Gosh, that birdhouse looks so good, I kinda wish I was a bird! Ha-ha!

TAG: Mickey_009_f
It sure is exciting to think that everybody's starting to come back.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
But there's actually somebody in particular that I'm especially waiting for...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
My sweetheart, Minnie. I was hoping to find her again when you opened the Meadow, but she wasn't there.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Maybe if we bring the Village back to what it was, she can come back...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I've been wondering where she was.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's get her!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm sure she's fine.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Me too! She disappeared, and I don't know how to find her.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
But now that you're here, I bet that together we can get her back!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
There's something kinda magical about you, {PlayerName}. I can't help but be hopeful when you're around.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Oh, I'd go get her in a second, if I knew where she was.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
I hope so. I don't know where she is.
