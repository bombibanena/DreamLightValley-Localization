Angelfish, do you have a moment?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Of course.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Let's talk later.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Angelfish, I need your baking expertise once again.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Would you bake me more <ActivityItem>Mermaid Cupcakes</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Ursula_012_f
I want to join in the celebration with the other Villagers.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm on the case. Or... cakes!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
This is really suspicious.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Why not some eel-themed cupcakes?

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Clever â but let's get down to business.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Make me the <ActivityItem>Mermaid Cupcakes</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_029_f
Next, I'll need you to deliver them to the Villagers, and I'll give you a reward.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
You know I always keep up MY end of a deal.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Isn't it just? But I promise a straightforward transaction.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Oh, I tried that one year, dearie. Apparently, gray and slimy confections aren't to everyone's taste.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
{PlayerName}, I need a little something from you. I'm not asking much. Just a token, really.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
Make me more of those <ActivityItem>Mermaid Cupcakes</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_020_f
The Villagers adore them, and the Dreamlight Parks Fest is the best way to summon a bit of goodwill for yours truly.

TAG: Ursula_021_f
Then, deliver them for me. By the time you're done, I'll have something special for you.

TAG: Ursula_022_f
Ready to do a little business, angelfish?

TAG: Ursula_023_f
As long as I have to endure this festival, I'll keep using it to help the Villagers warm up to me.

TAG: Ursula_024_f
Here's the deal... You bake me more of those <ActivityItem>Mermaid Cupcakes</ActivityItem> the Villagers love so much...

TAG: Ursula_030_f
...then deliver them for me...

TAG: Ursula_025_f
...and I'll make sure you get something EXTRA nice for your troubles.

TAG: Ursula_026_f
You're never too busy for me, are you, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Ursula_027_f
Well, I need more of those <ActivityItem>Mermaid Cupcakes</ActivityItem> you bake so well.

TAG: Ursula_028_f
Be a dear and hand those out for me. I'll have a treat for YOU when you return.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
I'll cut right to the chase... You're one of the best bakers in the Village, and I need your help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You need help with baking?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is this about cupcakes?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sounds like you want to make a deal.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Well, I'm a woman of many talents, but that's not one of them.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
It's about this "Dreamlight Parks Fest." Frankly, I loathe such inane celebrations, but indulging in the festivities will make me seem more... approachable. Trustworthy. Someone to make a deal with.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
So! I need you to make me a batch of <ActivityItem>Mermaid Cupcakes</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Ursula, YOU want Mermaid Cupcakes?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
That's right. What better way to show that Ariel and I have buried the trident?

TAG: Ursula_009_f
If you make the cupcakes and deliver them to the Villagers, I'll reward you. Handsomely.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
That's right. A sickeningly sweet little reminder of Atlantica. The Villagers can't get enough of them.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
You guessed it, dearie.

TAG: Ursula_031_f
Come by another time, angelfish. And make it SOON!
