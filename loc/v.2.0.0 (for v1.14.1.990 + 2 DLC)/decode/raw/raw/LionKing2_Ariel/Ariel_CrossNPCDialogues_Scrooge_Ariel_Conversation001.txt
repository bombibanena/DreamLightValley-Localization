There's whispers in the Village that you're a collector of rare treasures, lass.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
As a fellow treasure hunter, I wouldn't mind a wee gander at any rare artifacts you've found.

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Oh, I'd love to show you. I have lots of gizmos and whatsits!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Gizmos? Whatsits? I've never heard of such things.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
They must be rare finds indeed!
