Wow, {PlayerName}, is that a new outfit?

TAG: Remy_000_f
It's from Minnie and Daisy's clothing line, Dots & Daisies. They're launching in the Valley really soon!

TAG: Remy_011_f
That's great! Do you want me to cook something for the launch? I'm already thinking choux pastryâlike gougÃ¨res or Ã©clairs...

TAG: Remy_012_f
Slow down, Remy! We just wanted to make you aware of it.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Oh. They realize that I'm a rat, right? We don't wear clothes. Except when I put on my chef's hat, of course.

TAG: Remy_014_f
And just because I'm French doesn't mean I know the first thing about fashion.

Small businesses support each other!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe they could make you a custom chef's coat?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I knew you'd think it was weird.

TAG: Remy_015_f
Sorry, I guess I got a little carried away. And you're right.

TAG: Remy_002_f
I'll be sure to spread the word to all my customers! Thanks for the card, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Actually... That's a great idea! It could be very handy for formal events.

TAG: Remy_017_f
A little. But hey, I know all about hustling to make your business work.

TAG: Remy_018_f
"Dots & Daisies," huh? Sounds like a new business is opening in the Valley... Is it a homemade pasta shop?

TAG: Remy_001_f
It's Minnie and Daisy's new fashion line!
