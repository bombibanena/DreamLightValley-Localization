Hi Goofy! I'm back.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
With some pictures, as requested.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Gawrsh, those look great!

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was a hard task, but worth it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Easy peasy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They're not the best pictures I've ever taken...

TAG: Goofy_004_f
I sure understand that.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Sometimes I get kinda overwhelmed.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
The Valley's so amazing; it feels like if I can't take a picture of everything, then maybe I shouldn't take any pictures at all.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Well, I hope you're feeling inspired now.

TAG: Goofy_015_f
Yep! I can already imagine the next pictures I wanna take.

TAG: Goofy_016_f
Oh yeah?

TAG: Goofy_017_f
Maybe I'll even take some at WALLÂ·E's dance!

TAG: Goofy_018_f
So you're coming?!

TAG: Goofy_019_f
You bet I am! I wouldn't miss it!

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Gawrsh, I wish I had your picture-takin' confidence.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
You've just got to act like you have it.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
And then the real confidence will come.

TAG: Goofy_011_f
But sometimes a bad picture can inspire as much as a good one.

TAG: Goofy_012_f
Oh, I dunno, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Goofy_013_f
These look real swell to me!

TAG: Goofy_014_f
Thanks, Goofy; you're too kind.
