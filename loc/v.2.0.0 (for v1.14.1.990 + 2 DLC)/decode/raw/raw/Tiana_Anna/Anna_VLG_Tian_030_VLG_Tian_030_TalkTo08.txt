Hey Anna, what are you up to today?

TAG: Anna_009_f
I guess you'll have to ask Tiana about that!

TAG: Anna_010_f
I'm in!

TAG: Anna_001_f
Well, I thought I was in a sandwich mood...

TAG: Anna_002_f
But I've already made Fish Sandwiches, Raspberry Jam Sandwiches, Peanut Butter Sandwiches...

TAG: Anna_003_f
...and I'd really like to try something new.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Well, have I the activity for you!

TAG: Anna_005_f
Tiana is having a culinary contest. She's going to teach the basics of Cajun cuisine to a bunch of people...

TAG: Anna_006_f
...and then you'll compete to see who can make the best Cajun meal!

TAG: Anna_007_f
I love that idea!

TAG: Anna_008_f
Wait â are there Cajun sandwiches?
