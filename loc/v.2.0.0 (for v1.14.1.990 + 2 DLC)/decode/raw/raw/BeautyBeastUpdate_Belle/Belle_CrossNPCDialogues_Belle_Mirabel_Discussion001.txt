Mirabel, I've heard about your amazing magical family. My father's a genius inventor, but I wouldn't say that's exactly magical.

Oh, my father doesn't have a magical gift either.

TAG: Belle_002_f
He married into the family.

TAG: Belle_003_f
Does he ever feel bad about not having magic?

TAG: Belle_004_f
Papi? Not at all! He's very supportive!

TAG: Belle_005_f
I suppose being a good father is its own special magic, isn't it?
