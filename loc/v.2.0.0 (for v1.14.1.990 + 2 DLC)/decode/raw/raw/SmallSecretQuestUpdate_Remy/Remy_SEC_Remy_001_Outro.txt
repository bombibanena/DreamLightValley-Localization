Hey, {PlayerName}, you're back! Did you have time to bring those meals to Merlin, Mickey, Mr. McDuck, and Goofy?

TAG: Remy_001_f
How did they react? Did they enjoy 'em?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They were really happy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You almost made Merlin cry!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Of course they enjoyed them. I made them.

TAG: Remy_002_f
That's great! I'm glad to hear it.

TAG: Remy_003_f
And hey... while you were taking care of all that... I thought of a special meal I could make for you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Aw, thanks, Remy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't know what to say!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're not gonna make me gather the Ingredients, are you...?

TAG: Remy_004_f
Anytime, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Here you go... One three-course thank-you for everything you do around here.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Bon appÃ©tit!

TAG: Remy_007_f
Well, you don't need to say anything. Except maybe "you're welcome," I guess.

TAG: Remy_008_f
No, no, no. Don't worry. I already made it.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Really? Wow. It's pretty incredible when food makes people cry... for the right reasons.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Ha-ha. Right. I don't know why I even asked. You could turn burnt toast into a five-star meal.
