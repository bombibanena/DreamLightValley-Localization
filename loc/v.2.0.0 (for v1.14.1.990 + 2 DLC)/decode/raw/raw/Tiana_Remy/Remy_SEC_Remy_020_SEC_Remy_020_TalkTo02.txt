Remy... I'm remembering a picnic of sorts, with you there!

TAG: Remy_012_f
Good luck!

TAG: Remy_001_f
Yes, yes, I remember that... And it's jogging something else in my memory...

TAG: Remy_005_f
The taste of that dish is starting to come back to me!

TAG: Remy_006_f
Ooh, any guesses on the illegible Ingredients?

TAG: Remy_007_f
It's still vague, but I do remember it had a delicious creaminess to it. I'd stake my favorite chef knife on it â this recipe definitely has <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem> in it!

TAG: Remy_008_f
Milk... Copy that.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Why don't you try <Lore>talking to the other folks in the memory</Lore>? Maybe they'll remember something else about the dish that'll point us to the other missing Ingredients.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Great idea, Remy!

TAG: Remy_011_f
Maybe then we can figure out who served us the dish. I can't remember who it was.
