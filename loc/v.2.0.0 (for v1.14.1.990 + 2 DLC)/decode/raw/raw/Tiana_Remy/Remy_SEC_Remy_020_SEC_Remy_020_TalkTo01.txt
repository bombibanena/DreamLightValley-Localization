Hey, Remy. Want to help me solve a culinary mystery?

TAG: Remy_005_f
A culinary mystery? Absolutely!

TAG: Remy_006_f
So I found this cookbook in the <Lore>Glade of Trust</Lore>.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Hmm, looks like the book got wet. Only the first recipe is kinda legible and even then it's hard to make out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Think you could help me figure it out?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do we need some magic to fix this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I believe in you!

TAG: Remy_001_f
Of course!

TAG: Remy_009_f
I can make out that it needs <ActivityItem>Shrimp</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Remy_010_f
Okay... The list of other Ingredients is too soggy to read, but let me see if I can make out some of the instructions.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Oh! I think I've seen cooking techniques like this before!

TAG: Remy_012_f
No question about it â this is a recipe for some kind of <Lore>Cajun food</Lore>!

TAG: Remy_013_f
Whoa! Something's coming out of the cookbook!

TAG: Remy_003_f
I don't think so. Let's keep working on it.

TAG: Remy_014_f
Thanks!
