Remy! How are you liking Tiana's Meal Stall?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Oh, I'm in culinary bliss!

TAG: Remy_003_f
Nice! What's standing out to you?

TAG: Remy_004_f
Well, I especially like the Cajun dishes. The similarities to French cuisine are striking.

TAG: Remy_005_f
But these flavors are so bold, so exciting!

TAG: Remy_006_f
And the spice!

TAG: Remy_007_f
Have you been converted to the Cajun side of things?

TAG: Remy_008_f
I wouldn't go that far...

TAG: Remy_009_f
But I'm definitely considering some form of culinary exchange program!
