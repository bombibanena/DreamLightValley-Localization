Hello, Minnie! I'm here on an official errand.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Oh, how exciting!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
It's for Gaston. He's looking for a new sidekick. Would you be interested?

TAG: Minnie_004_f
A sidekick. Well, if that means he'll make a friend, I think it's wonderful.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
But... I'm afraid I don't have time.

TAG: Minnie_000_f
I'm so busy with my gardening, and book club, and helping all the adorable animals.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Minnie, YOU'RE adorable.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I wish I could do the same!

TAG: Minnie_010_f
Hee-hee. Thank you. So are you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Minnie_006_f
I hope Gaston won't be too upset.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Oh, no worries whatsoever!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'd have said "no" as well.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sure he'll get over it.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
Well, I hope Gaston makes a friend.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Good luck with the rest of your errand!

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Thanks, Minnie!

TAG: Minnie_013_f
With your help, I'm sure he will.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Well, you're welcome to join me anytime!
