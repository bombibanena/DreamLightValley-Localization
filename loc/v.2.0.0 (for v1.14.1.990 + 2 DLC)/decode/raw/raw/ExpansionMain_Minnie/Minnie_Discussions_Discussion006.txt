Oooh! That Gaston makes me so angry!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What did he do this time?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you want me to talk to him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's a jerk.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
He was going on and on about how girls are weak and fragile! I'd like to give him a piece of my mind, and then we'll see who he calls weak!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You go, girl.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Don't listen to him.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's some nonsense.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Thank you! I will!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Oh, I know I shouldn't. But he really does need to learn his lesson. And maybe I'll be just the girl to teach it to him.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
It really is! Well, if he stays here, he'll learn a thing or two if I have anything to say about it.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
No, that's quite all right. I'm perfectly capable of talking to him myself.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
That's putting it mildly.
