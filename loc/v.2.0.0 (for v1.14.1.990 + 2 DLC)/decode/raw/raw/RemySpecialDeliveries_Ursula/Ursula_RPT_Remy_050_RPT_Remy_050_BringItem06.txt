Well, well. These desserts look better than anything Triton ever served at the palace.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Are you looking to trade something for them?

TAG: Player_000_f
Nope. They're a gift from the Fairy Godmother.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She wanted to show she appreciates you just for being you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She wanted to prove to you that people can give without expecting something in return.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Ugh! That Goody Two-shoes!

TAG: Ursula_004_f
She's not doing this out of kindness. She's trying to one-up me after our little argument.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
For the low price of some paltry desserts, the Fairy Godmother gets to feel superior.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I'll enjoy these desserts... almost as much as I'll enjoy knowing I was right.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Take it from me, dearie. There's no such thing as a selfless good deed.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Oh, please! Don't you see that all she's done is prove me right?
