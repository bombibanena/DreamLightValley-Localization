{PlayerName}, I've seen what's going on in the sky over the Village.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
If there's any way I can help, you only have to ask.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe you can make an ice shield around the Village?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Just keep being you, Elsa. That's all the help we need.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't even know how to help myself...

TAG: Elsa_022_f
If it comes to that, I'm certainly happy to try.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Well... I know there's one way you can definitely help.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
Take a look at this.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
Does it look familiar?

TAG: Elsa_007_f
Oh... It... it does look familiar... from a long time ago.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
We think it belonged to the Forgotten. We need to know the story behind it.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
I wish I could remember. But it's like there's a mist over my memories of it...

TAG: Elsa_009_f
That's the Forgetting. Try to focus. Maybe you can fight through it.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
It's so strange. When I look at you... and when I think of the adventures we've gone on together...

TAG: Elsa_012_f
It feels like it's only just out of reach.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
Our friendship... It might be strong enough to bring back your memories. Maybe we just need to spend a little more time together.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
It's worth a try. And I always enjoy spending time with you.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
It's funny. Just a second ago, it was like my memories of this were covered over by a mist.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
But then... I looked at you, and I thought of our friendship, and the adventures we've gone on together...

TAG: Elsa_015_f
And I remembered... I gave this to you.

TAG: Elsa_016_f
You were just a child then. You wanted to explore the Ice Cavern with me.

TAG: Elsa_017_f
But it was so cold in there. So I brought you my favorite blanket from home.

TAG: Elsa_018_f
And when the Forgotten split off... well, I guess they held onto it until they dropped it in the secret chamber. I wish I could remember this. But I guess the Forgotten has some of those memories.

TAG: Elsa_019_f
Well, I hope you can help pull the Forgotten back from the edge before it's too late.

TAG: Elsa_020_f
And if you do manage to bring them back... well, maybe I can talk with them. I know what it's like to go too far.

TAG: Elsa_021_f
Thanks, Elsa. That's all I need for now. The magic coming off of the blanket seems stronger already...

TAG: Elsa_023_f
That's nice of you to say. But I just... I can't stand by and watch the Village come apart around us.

TAG: Elsa_024_f
We'll figure this out. We always have.
