WALLÂ·E! I made some <ActivityItem>High Beach Torches</ActivityItem> for Mickey and Minnie's dinner date! What do you think?

Hmm...

TAG: WallE_002_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_003_f
Well, I'm going to take that as a sign of approval!

TAG: WallE_004_f
Ooh!

Whoa! A <ActivityItem>Boot Bouquet</ActivityItem>?! You made this for the dinner date too?

I love it!

It's perfect to inspire romance.

The boot is an interesting choice...

TAG: WallE_006_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_010_f
Let's keep going! We still need to set up the area with our decorations and cook up some food!

TAG: WallE_008_f
Oh. *sigh*

Don't worry â it's the thought that counts!
