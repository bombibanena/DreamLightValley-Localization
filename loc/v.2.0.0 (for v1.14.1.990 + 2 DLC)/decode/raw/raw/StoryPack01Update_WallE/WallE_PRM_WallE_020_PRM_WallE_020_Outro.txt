Do you feel like you got some ideas for when EVE is back?

TAG: WallE_010_f
EVE-ah! EVE-ah!

That's great. I just know she's out there somewhere in the Valley. With any luck... we'll find her.

TAG: WallE_001_f
Whoa!

TAG: WallE_002_f
I think that all went rather well!

TAG: WallE_003_f
Maybe Merlin and Mother Gothel aren't the most natural match...

TAG: WallE_004_f
Aww...

TAG: WallE_005_f
But still, I think they're going to get along better now.

TAG: WallE_006_f
Whew!

Plus, we helped Mickey and Minnie.
