WALLÂ·E! Were you looking for this?

TAG: WallE_001_f
Whoa!

Happy to help!

You don't want it? I can give it back to Mirabel...

What are you going to use it for?

TAG: WallE_004_f
Wow!

What do you want to use it for?

Directive!

It looks like it's from a trash can lid. Is that what you want?

TAG: WallE_007_f
*whistle* WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_008_f
Well, you don't have to ask me twice. If you want a trash can lid, a trash can lid will be yours!

Why don't we go <Lore>talk to Goofy</Lore>? He's always touring the Village looking for nice pictures â maybe he saw something we can use!

TAG: WallE_019_f
With any luck, he'll know just what to do.

TAG: WallE_015_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_005_f
No!

TAG: WallE_006_f
Directive!
