OK, I think we're finally ready!

TAG: WallE_001_f
Directive?

TAG: WallE_002_f
The part of the Village we decorated is looking wonderful.

TAG: WallE_003_f
And I'm looking good in this outfit...

*hums a melody*

TAG: WallE_012_f
I guess while I was inviting everyone, you were out looking for this.

TAG: WallE_013_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I love it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So old-school!

TAG: WallE_004_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_005_f
I think we should be just about ready to start!

TAG: WallE_006_f
No.

TAG: WallE_007_f
Oh? We still have something to do?

TAG: WallE_008_f
Ta-da!

TAG: WallE_009_f
Oooh, good call WALLÂ·E. A phonograph is the perfect cherry on top here.

TAG: WallE_010_f
Gotta have some good tunes for a party.

TAG: WallE_014_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_016_f
OK, I'll place the phonograph.

TAG: WallE_017_f
And then it's time to dance!

TAG: WallE_018_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_015_f
WALLÂ·E.

TAG: WallE_022_f
I'm feeling ready to cut a rug!
