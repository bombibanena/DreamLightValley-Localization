Huh?

TAG: WallE_001_f
Look at all this <ActivityItem>Scrap Metal</ActivityItem> I found!

TAG: WallE_002_f
Whoa!

TAG: WallE_003_f
...

TAG: WallE_004_f
Oh. Hmm...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Something wrong?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A thank-you would be nice!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I know; it's not a new trash can lid. Yet.

TAG: WallE_005_f
Directive?

TAG: WallE_012_f
Hmm... You're gesturing like we need more of this stuff. So we just need to find you another few piecesâ

TAG: WallE_013_f
Then we can fix you up a fresh lid!

TAG: WallE_014_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_015_f
Where to look, though...?

TAG: WallE_016_f
Goofy did say that Ursula has some <ActivityItem>Scrap Metal</ActivityItem> she took from Dazzle Beach.

TAG: WallE_018_f
*gasp* Whoa! Uh-oh...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Are you scared of Ursula?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I've got your back; don't worry!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Honestly, we've been getting along great recently!

TAG: WallE_019_f
*shudder*

TAG: WallE_022_f
It'll be okay. I promise.

TAG: WallE_023_f
But given what Goofy told us... Ursula might not be willing to just give the pieces to us.

TAG: WallE_024_f
Eeee!

TAG: WallE_025_f
Don't worry; I have a plan!

TAG: WallE_026_f
I'll make her a new <ActivityItem>Potion Set</ActivityItem> and then give it to her in the <ActivityItem>Cursed Cave</ActivityItem> as a distraction. You just zoom into her House and grab the <ActivityItem>Scrap Metal</ActivityItem>!

TAG: WallE_027_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_020_f
Whew!

TAG: WallE_021_f
Uh...

TAG: WallE_006_f
Ohh... WALLÂ·E?

TAG: WallE_007_f
Not sure if that's a thank-you...

TAG: WallE_008_f
But as Maui would sayâ

TAG: WallE_009_f
You're welcome!

TAG: WallE_010_f
Ooh!

TAG: WallE_028_f
But in any case...

TAG: WallE_011_f
Oh. Oh. Oh!
