Hey {PlayerName}... Could I talk to you about my friends, Timon and Pumbaa?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What about them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's talk about them later.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Well, they're two of my best friends, and I had a really weird dream about them last night.

TAG: Simba_002_f
I was in a strange jungle, and I heard them calling my name, but I couldn't reach them. In the dream, I searched the jungle for hours.

TAG: Simba_003_f
What do you think it means?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You miss your friends.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're afraid of getting lost?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I didn't know lions could dream!

TAG: Simba_004_f
You're probably right.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I'd really like to find them. I hope they're back in my Realm somewhere.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I don't remember them being there.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I can go back and search for them.

TAG: Simba_006_f
It's funny... Sort of hazy, like a dream? Before you arrived, they were there, and then they weren't. It's like once they were out of sight, they sort of drifted away... out of my mind.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Don't blame yourself, Simba. Realms are funny like that. But I bet if I <Lore>went back to your Realm, I could find them</Lore>.

TAG: Simba_008_f
Would you really go and look? I can't shake the feeling I left them behind.

TAG: Simba_009_f
I usually don't get lost. My sense of smell helps me keep track of where I am.

TAG: Simba_010_f
Oh, sure. Usually I dream about running across the savanna, or chasing off hyenas. Nala says I roar in my sleep.

TAG: Simba_011_f
But I can't stop thinking about Timon and Pumbaa though...

TAG: Simba_012_f
Okay, come find me when you have some time.
