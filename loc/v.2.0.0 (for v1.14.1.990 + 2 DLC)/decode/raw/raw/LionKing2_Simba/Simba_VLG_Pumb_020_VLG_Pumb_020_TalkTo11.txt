Hey... So Timon seems to be doin' pretty well with his paws, but mine are too big to make stuff with.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Any advice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe a tool of some kind?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sometimes artists hold brushes in their mouths?

TAG: Simba_002_f
Yeah. That's a good idea!

TAG: Simba_003_f
Well, here ya go. This clay stuff is pretty neat... Thanks for the advice, {PlayerName}!
