Ah, {PlayerName}! I've heard a most interesting rumor. You're joining Mulan and Mushu to bring shadow plays back to the Valley?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
We're trying, but we're having some problems with the lantern...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I suppose it won't stay lit; is that right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, can you help us?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you have a spell for perma-fire?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Merlin, do you know EVERYTHING?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Naturally! What you seek is a <ActivityItem>Draconic Garnet</ActivityItem> â a special gem that, when filled with Mushu's Guardian fire, burns eternal!

TAG: Merlin_013_f
We had one before the Forgetting, but I'm afraid I used it in one of my experimental attempts to stop the Night Thorns... Singed my beard a bit, in fact.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
But I have no doubt with your usual talent you'll be able to create a new one!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Once you collect the odds and ends to craft the <ActivityItem>Empty Draconic Garnet</ActivityItem>, bring it to Mushu so he can breathe fire into it.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Magical fire? I should think not! Such a thing would be FAR too dangerous.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
You must create a <ActivityItem>Draconic Garnet</ActivityItem>. It's a gem that Mushu can fill with his fire, and then it will burn safely.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
No, but I SEEK to know and understand all I can. That's what keeps MY lantern burning, you might say.
