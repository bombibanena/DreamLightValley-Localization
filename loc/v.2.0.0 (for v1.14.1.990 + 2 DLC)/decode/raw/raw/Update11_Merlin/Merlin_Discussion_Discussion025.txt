Blast it, if I have to talk to Ursula once more today, I may lose my temper!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Did you two argue again?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why don't you like her?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I wish you two could get along.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
{PlayerName}, you may assume that Ursula and I are always disagreeing.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
The moments we are not are pure anomalies.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Aside from her general villainy? Victimizing innocent merfolk?

TAG: Merlin_011_f
She's... she's mercenary about magic! I simply will not abide that.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
With that villainous sea witch?! Never!

TAG: Merlin_013_f
The day we "get along," I insist you check me for curses.
