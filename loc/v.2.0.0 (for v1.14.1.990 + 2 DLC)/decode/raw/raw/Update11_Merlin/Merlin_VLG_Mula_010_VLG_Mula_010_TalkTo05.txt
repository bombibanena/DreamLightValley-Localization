Ah, good morrow, {PlayerName}! You've come to invite me to tea with Mulan, I presume?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Did you see the future?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Merlin, have you been gossiping again?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Was that supposed to impress me?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
No, no, my friend. Though I am a prognosticator, so such a feat WOULD be within my grasp.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I merely observed the installation of Mulan's Tea Stall. And I detect the faintest whiff of <Lore>Chrysanthemum</Lore> in the air today.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
An old favorite that I'll be delighted to indulge in again at Mulan's home.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I'll have you know wizards do not gossip! We leave that to cantankerous owls.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Magic and prognostication ought never to be wielded to impress others. Why, that would be major magical misconduct!
