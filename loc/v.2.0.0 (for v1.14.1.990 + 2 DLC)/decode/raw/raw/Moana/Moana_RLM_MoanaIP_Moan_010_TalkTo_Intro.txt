Hello! I'm Moana of Motunui. Have we met before?

TAG: Player_000_f
I come from this place called Dreamlight Valley...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
My Valley is overrun with strange dark thorns.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I need your help! You HAVE to go there with me!

TAG: Moana_001_f
Plant problems, huh? Did you anger a goddess? That's why we had a BIG problem, not too long ago.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Hmm... I get the sense you'd like my help. And I'd really like to help you, but I have things I need to do.

TAG: Moana_000_f
I'm searching for some rich fishing spots in the ocean.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Now that my people are voyagers again, we can find more options for fishing.

TAG: Moana_010_f
Hey, if you help me with that, then I should have time to help you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Of course!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I know nothing about canoes.

TAG: Moana_003_f
Great. We should start by fixing my canoe so it's ready for a long journey.

TAG: Moana_011_f
We'll need some wood and woven leaves.

TAG: Moana_006_f
We could use <ActivityItem>Silk</ActivityItem>. It's a type of cloth that would make a great sail. Don't worry. I'll take care of all that.

TAG: Moana_007_f
Thanks! ... Oh, one more thing! There's some debris from a storm caught on the reef. It might damage the canoe when we leave.

TAG: Moana_012_f
But I bet Maui can help with that. Have you seen him? He's around here somewhere.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Don't worry. I just need a few things to make sure my canoe's ready for a long journey.

TAG: Moana_005_f
Okay... that was intense. I'd like to help, but I have things I need to do.
