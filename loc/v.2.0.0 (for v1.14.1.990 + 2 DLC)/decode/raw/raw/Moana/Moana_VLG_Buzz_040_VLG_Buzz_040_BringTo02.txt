Hey, {PlayerName}. What sort of adventure are we going on today?

TAG: Player_000_f
Buzz and I would like to invite you to join our new Star Command Academy here in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We need your wayfinder expertise.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You'd learn more about the stars.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You could help the Village.

TAG: Moana_003_f
It sounds amazing, but I navigate by the stars, not through the stars.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Are you sure I'd be a good fit?

TAG: Player_001_f
You left your island to save it when you didn't know much about sailing...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's the definition of heroism.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You'll learn how to be a Space Ranger the same way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's the kind of boldness we need.

TAG: Moana_011_f
Huh. I guess I never thought about it that way.

TAG: Moana_014_f
And it does sound like an interesting new journey...

TAG: Moana_015_f
All right, {PlayerName}, I'll try it!

TAG: Moana_012_f
I did learn a lot about sailing after I was already out on the open sea.

TAG: Moana_013_f
Huh. It was kind of bold, wasn't it?

TAG: Moana_005_f
Really? That would be amazing!

TAG: Moana_009_f
Oh, but I'm really more of a sea voyager. Are you sure I'd be a good fit?

TAG: Moana_006_f
Well, you know I'd love to do that.

TAG: Moana_010_f
Though I'm really more of a sea voyager. Are you sure I'd be a good fit?
