{PlayerName}, do you remember that mysterious shiny thing we found on the boat?

TAG: Moana_009_f
I have an idea about it, but I'll need help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm happy to help. I love a good mystery.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Not right now.

TAG: Moana_001_f
Well, I'm pretty sure it came from the sea and it has some kind of power.

TAG: Moana_003_f
Maui knows a lot about both of those things.

TAG: Moana_004_f
But... he's not really talking to me. He's still upset that I left without telling him.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
It makes sense that he's upset. Have you apologized?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Why do you need to tell him everything? He's not the boss of you!

TAG: Moana_006_f
Yes, but he's still pretty grumpy.

TAG: Moana_010_f
So, I'm thinking he might change his mind if we got him some gifts.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Maui loves presents! Especially food.

TAG: Moana_005_f
Since he got here, I know he really likes <ActivityItem>Seafood Salad</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>, and something called a <ActivityItem>Seafood Platter</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_011_f
If we could bring him those meals, it might help.

TAG: Moana_007_f
No, he's not, but he's my friend. I should've told him where I was going.

TAG: Moana_008_f
I think he's upset because he was worried about me.

TAG: Moana_012_f
Okay, I'll be here... waiting. With this strange object. No rush.
