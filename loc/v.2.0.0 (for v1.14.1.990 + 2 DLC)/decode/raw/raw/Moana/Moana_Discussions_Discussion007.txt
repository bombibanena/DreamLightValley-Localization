I was just thinking about my Gramma. I still really miss her.

Who is that?

The grief will pass.

You'll always have her memory.

My Gramma Tala. My father's mother. I loved her so much. She... she understood me.

TAG: Moana_004_f
She told me the story of Te Fiti. And that our ancestors were voyagers.

Sometimes I feel her spirit with me, but I still miss what we had. I was really lucky to have her.

I know. The sadness... it's softer than it used to be.

TAG: Moana_006_f
When she died I was so sad; it was like a sharp pain. But now it's like a distant ache. Familiar, almost comforting.

TAG: Moana_007_f
I guess that's the love.

TAG: Moana_003_f
You're right. And that's really comforting. She wouldn't want me to stay sad. And I won't.

TAG: Moana_008_f
But she was important. I don't want my heart to forget her.
