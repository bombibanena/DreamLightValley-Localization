Hi, {PlayerName}! How's it going with Maui?

TAG: Moana_002_f
Yeah, he really is. We had some amazing adventures together, after he finished telling me about himself...

TAG: Moana_026_f
Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea, hero to all.

TAG: Moana_023_f
Oh, and he has a magic fishhook that lets him shapeshift into different animals.

TAG: Moana_022_f
There are a LOT of stories about him. But I think he has a favorite.

TAG: Moana_014_f
I think that's everything you need to know about Maui.

TAG: Moana_006_f
Oh, IS he? That sounds like him.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Yes. But he's also sincere and brave.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Uh-oh. Was he upset that you didn't know who he was? I bet he was upset.

TAG: Moana_009_f
I should probably tell you a little about him.
