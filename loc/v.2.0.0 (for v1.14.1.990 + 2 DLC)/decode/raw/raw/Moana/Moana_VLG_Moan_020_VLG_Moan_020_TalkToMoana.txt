So, what did he say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He says it's a start.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He didn't forgive you, but he kept the food...

TAG: Moana_001_f
I don't blame him for being upset. He probably feels abandoned.

TAG: Moana_004_f
I should give him something else... Something he can treasure...

TAG: Moana_005_f
Something that screams "Maui."

TAG: Player_002_f
How about an <ActivityItem>Oar</ActivityItem>...?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Since he's got such excellent wayfinding abilities.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
So he can help you row your canoe around the island.

TAG: Moana_006_f
An <ActivityItem>Oar</ActivityItem>? That would be perfect! But it'll have to be a pretty special <ActivityItem>Oar</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_007_f
And when he has it, everyone will know he's the most experienced wayfinder in the Valley. He'll like that.

TAG: Moana_003_f
I'll go collect some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and whip something up for him at a Crafting Station.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Would you? That would be so great.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Typical Maui. But that's promising.
