I'm ready to start sailing.

TAG: Player_003_exit_011_f
I have some questions...

TAG: Player_003_exit_012_f
Can we go back to the island?

TAG: Player_003_exit_013_f
I changed my mind. Let's stay here.

TAG: Moana_003_f
Was there something you wanted to ask me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Remind me what we're doing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't know how to sail!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Never mind...

TAG: Moana_006_f
We're searching for good fishing spots in the ocean.

TAG: Moana_007_f
My people are voyagers, so we need to find food while we're traveling.

TAG: Moana_005_f
Do you have any other questions, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Moana_004_f
Don't worry. I'll handle the wayfinding; you just have to tell me where you want to sail to.

TAG: Moana_001_f
I'll guide us back to shore.

TAG: Moana_000_f
Just tell me when you're ready to sail again.

TAG: Moana_015_f
Don't be afraid; the ocean's a friend of mine.
