Have you noticed anything interesting in the seas around the Beach?

TAG: Moana_001_f
I found lots of little islands. But there's something strange about this place.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Whenever I try to go back and find the same island twice... it's gone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe you navigated to the wrong spot?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe it drifted somewhere else?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe... I don't know. Dreamlight Valley is weird.

TAG: Moana_004_f
I don't think so.

TAG: Moana_005_f
I've gotten pretty good at wayfinding.

TAG: Moana_010_f
Something weird is happening with the waters around the Village. I just need to figure out what.

TAG: Moana_006_f
That's the funny thing. I think they ARE moving, but it's even stranger than that.

TAG: Moana_007_f
Sometimes I'll be sailing towards an island and I'll blink... and all of a sudden...

TAG: Moana_008_f
...it's just gone. And then ten minutes later, I find it somewhere else.

TAG: Moana_009_f
I need to figure out how to map them... or if there's any pattern to it...

TAG: Moana_011_f
You're right. It is.

TAG: Moana_012_f
I just wonder if it's weird in a way that I can figure out, and use that to help us.
