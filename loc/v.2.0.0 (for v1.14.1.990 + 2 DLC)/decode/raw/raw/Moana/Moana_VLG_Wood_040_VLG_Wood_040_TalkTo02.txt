Hey, {PlayerName}. Off on another great adventure?

TAG: Moana_000_f
Woody and I are trying to fix his Carousel.

Merlin enchanted an old toy chest to power the lights, but for it to work we need some treasured childhood items.

TAG: Player_000_f
I was wondering if we could borrow something of yours...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I bet the ocean gave you tons of gifts.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It would help the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Anything with a cute backstory will do, really.

The ocean is definitely a friend of mine. I remember the first time I realized that...

TAG: Moana_007_f
I was really young and I'd run off to the beach on my own.

A baby turtle needed to reach the water, so I protected it from some birds. Then the ocean gave me some shells... and the heart of Te Fiti.

TAG: Moana_006_f
I'd be happy to share one of the shells with Woody. Here you go. It's a <ActivityItem>Conch Shell</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_008_f
You know I always like to help. And I have just the thing...

TAG: Moana_009_f
Oh, I have just the thing!
