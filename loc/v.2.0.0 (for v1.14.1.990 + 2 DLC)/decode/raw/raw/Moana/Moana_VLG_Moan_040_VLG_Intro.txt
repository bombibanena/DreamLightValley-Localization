Hi, {PlayerName}! I put my plan to work after you gave me the <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Moana_004_f
Want to come with me to see if Pua came out to get them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Fingers crossed. Let's go!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What if another animal got to the coconuts?

How does a pig get a taste for coconuts?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I can't right now. I'm sorry.

I don't know what "fingers crossed" means, but it sounds good! Follow me!

TAG: Moana_002_f
Trust me. A hungry Pua will get to them first!

TAG: Moana_006_f
Follow me!

TAG: Moana_003_f
Pua mostly loves coconut water. We drink a lot of it on Motunui. I hope Pua remembers that. Guess there's only one way to find out.

Okay, but come back quickly!
