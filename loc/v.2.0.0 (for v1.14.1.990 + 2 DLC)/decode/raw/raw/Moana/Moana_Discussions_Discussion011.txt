Hey, {PlayerName}! I was wondering, have you seen all the turtles on Dazzle Beach?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're so cute!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
There are so many different kinds.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No, I haven't seen them.

TAG: Moana_001_f
I know! I love watching them crawl around.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Oh, and if you're wondering... they really like seaweed.

I'm sure if you gave them some, you could have a whole bunch of turtles following you around.

Well, they're very cute! You should look for them on Dazzle Beach.
