Hi, {PlayerName}. Wow, you seem busy. Can I help you with anything?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ursula told me to talk to you...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Have you found any seashells lately?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
So I'm doing this spell and...

TAG: Moana_001_f
The Sea Witch... Are you sure it's a good idea to listen to her?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
She's hungry for power.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
She's a necessary evil...

TAG: Moana_005_f
Yeah, she reminds of a giant crab I met... I hope you don't get caught in whatever she's up to.

TAG: Moana_009_f
You said she asked you to get a seashell from me?

TAG: Moana_007_f
Well, I did find this on the Beach. I thought it was a gift from the ocean but maybe it's a gift to you. Be careful!

TAG: Moana_010_f
And she asked you to get a seashell... from me?

TAG: Moana_002_f
Actually, I did! I thought it was a nice present from the ocean, but I'm starting to think maybe it wasn't for me at all!

TAG: Moana_004_f
Here. It's all yours!

TAG: Moana_008_f
I need a seashell... from you.

TAG: Moana_003_f
Oh, okay. I guess the ocean must've known. Look what I found on the Beach...
