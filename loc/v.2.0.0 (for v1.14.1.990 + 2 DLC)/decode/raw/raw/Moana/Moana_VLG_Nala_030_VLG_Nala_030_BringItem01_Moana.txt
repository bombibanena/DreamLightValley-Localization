{PlayerName}, you caught some fish! That's amazing!

I've had to go farther and farther out to catch anything but those creepy glowing fish with the bulging eyes.

It reminds me of when the fish disappeared around Motunui. I had to leave my island to find a way to fix it.

I wonder if someone will have to voyage from the Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Don't worry. Nala and I are going to fix this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Nala and I are doing our best. But it's not looking good.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I don't know if there's anywhere around here we could voyage to. Nala and I have to fix this.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Well, if anyone can figure this out, it's you two. I just hope you figure it out soon.

I really miss being able to fish.
