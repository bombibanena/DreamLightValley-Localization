Eric, is it true that you used to sail on a really large boat?

TAG: Moana_001_f
I did. We had a pretty big crew and sailed to a bunch of different kingdoms.

TAG: Moana_004_f
So you're a voyager, too! What happened to your boat?

TAG: Moana_005_f
It was wrecked during a storm.

TAG: Moana_002_f
I've been caught in a storm on the ocean too! It can be scary. And I'm sorry about your boat.

TAG: Moana_003_f
Aw, it's okay. It was scary, but no one was hurt.

And if it hadn't sunk, I might've never met Ariel.
