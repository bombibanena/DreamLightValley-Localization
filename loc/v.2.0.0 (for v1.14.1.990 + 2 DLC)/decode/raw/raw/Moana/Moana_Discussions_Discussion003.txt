{PlayerName}, I'm curious. Have you ever sailed on the ocean?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm afraid of the water.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Never, but I want to!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Of course I have! The water calls me.

TAG: Moana_001_f
That's understandable. The ocean can be frightening, especially in a storm.

TAG: Moana_002_f
But if you get to know the currents and learn to sail, it can be amazing!

TAG: Moana_005_f
That's great! Maybe someday we can take a voyage together.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Me too!

TAG: Moana_009_f
When I was little, I'd go to the shore every chance I got. And one day... the ocean introduced itself to me!

At least that's what Gramma Tala said. I was just a baby, so I don't really remember.
