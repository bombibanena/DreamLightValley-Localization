Do you ever think about coconuts? I mean, REALLY think about them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm allergic.

TAG: Moana_001_f
You do?! Oh... Well, what do you think of coconuts?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They're useful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
They're kind of boring.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Sure. They're definitely useful. We use the fibers and leaves. We drink the water and eat the meat.

TAG: Moana_003_f
But there's more to life than coconuts, right?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Right.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
No, only coconuts.

TAG: Moana_009_f
Thank you! Don't get me wrong; I'm grateful for coconuts. But a person can't live on coconuts alone.

TAG: Moana_010_f
A person needs to explore, and find out who she is! ... Wait, you know I was just using coconuts as a metaphor, right?

TAG: Moana_011_f
Okaaaay... You'd really like my dad.

Well, my dad does. A LOT.

You're allergic to coconuts? Wow, that must be really hard. On Motunui, almost everything is made from coconuts!

TAG: Moana_013_f
I guess you can eat fish, though? I hope you like fish.
