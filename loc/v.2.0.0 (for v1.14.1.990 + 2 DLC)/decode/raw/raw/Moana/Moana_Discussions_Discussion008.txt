When I was young, my father wanted me to be happy where I was. To focus on my responsibility to our people.

But there was something inside me that called me to the ocean. I found a way to bring those two things together. Our people are voyagers again.

I'd like to voyage someday.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm happy right where I am. No voyaging for me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm glad you found a way to bring those two things together.

Oh, I know you'd love it!

After seeing how you were in my canoe, I can tell the ocean calls to you just as much as it does to me.

I know a lot of people who feel that way. And I love Motunui. I'm always happy there. And in your Village, too.

But the ocean is always calling to me to sail and explore.

TAG: Moana_007_f
Me too. I'm so grateful.

Discovering who we were made who we are even more incredible!
