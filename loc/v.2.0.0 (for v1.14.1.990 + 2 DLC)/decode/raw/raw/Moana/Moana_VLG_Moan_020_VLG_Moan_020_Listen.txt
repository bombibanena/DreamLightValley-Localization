Oh. Hey. Moana.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Um, what's that shiny thing you're holding? Another gift?

TAG: Moana_009_f
Oh! I forgot. We don't know what it is. I wanted to ask you about it.

TAG: Moana_010_f
Hey, I remember these! They're called Leader Shards. Mystical thingamajigs. They show up when people are leader-y.

TAG: Moana_011_f
I'm surprised there's only one. Both of you should be covered in them.

TAG: Moana_014_f
Yeah. There's another one. Pick it up. It's definitely for you.

TAG: Moana_001_f
Maui, I should have told you I was coming to the Valley.

TAG: Moana_003_f
I was just so excited about exploring and didn't think about how it would make you feel.

TAG: Moana_004_f
So, I'm sorry. And this is for you.

TAG: Moana_002_f
I... huh... What is this thing?

TAG: Moana_005_f
It's an Oar... so everyone will know you're the most experienced wayfinder in the Valley.

TAG: Moana_006_f
Aw. Thanks, Moana.

TAG: Moana_007_f
And hey. What can I say except: I forgive you.
