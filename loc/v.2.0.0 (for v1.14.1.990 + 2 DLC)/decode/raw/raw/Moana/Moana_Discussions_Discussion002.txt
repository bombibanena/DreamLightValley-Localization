That's great! For me, it's definitely the ocean. Even if sometimes I have a hard time figuring out what it wants.

Really? I'd love to learn more about the forest. I've seen so many new trees just in this Village!

It's incredible, right? So beautiful and yet so wild. I could never live away from the water.

I've seen the mountains here in the distance, but I haven't been there yet. I bet the view is amazing!

Interesting... I'd love to know more about that. You'll have to show me sometime!

TAG: Moana_009_f
Well, if you ever want to cook for me, I'd be okay with that. Being out on the water always makes me hungry!

TAG: Moana_010_f
I'm sorry, I don't know what that is. But it sounds interesting.
