Hey Kristoff, what can you tell me about your beignets?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
They were... surprisingly cold in the center.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Well, you know me: I'm all about ice, and iced cream is the tastiest form of ice!

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
I wanted to see if I could combine them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That turned out deliciously!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
And you've never heard of a Baked Alaska before?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess this means you gotta serve the beignets quick...

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
You liked them? That's great! Never hurts to learn some new skills, right? And I'm hoping that making dessert will impress Anna.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Well, I'm definitely impressed, and I'm sure Anna will be too. Keep up the good work!

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
No.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
True. They'd get soggy and leaky pretty fast.
