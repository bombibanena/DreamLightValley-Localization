Well, now... What was it that rat called these meals again?

"Sushi"? I must admit I've acquired a bit of a taste for it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's pretty good, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's perfect for a lion. Mostly just raw fish!

I guess me and Remy aren't such bad cooks after all, are we?

It's hardly a royal feast, but it is the closest thing that passes for one here.

Here. I found this lying about by Scrooge McDuck's place. I presume it's more useful to you than it is to me.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Ah, I knew it tasted familiar.

Oh, I didn't say that. The meal will suffice, but it's hardly worthy of a king.
