Oh, {PlayerName}. It's you.

TAG: Scar_001_f
I suppose you witnessed that little... misunderstanding... I had with Donald?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Scar, don't lie.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
"Misunderstanding," eh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What have I told you about eating other Villagers?

TAG: Scar_002_f
Lie? How insulting! I won't stand by while you make such slanderous accusations.

TAG: Scar_006_f
*sigh* I suppose I'll just have to eat these desserts myself. Pity.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Why, yes. Donald mistook my gracious gift for some sort of trap.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Don't worry. I've learned my lesson.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Next time, I'll pick a quieter Villager. One less likely to throw a tantrum.
