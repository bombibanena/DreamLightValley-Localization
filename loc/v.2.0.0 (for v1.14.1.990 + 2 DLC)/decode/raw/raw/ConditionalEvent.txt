I just spotted what looks like a cookbook in the Glade of Trust! It was a little big for me to pick up and move around, but if you grab it, I bet we can find some interesting recipes in it!

{PlayerName}, fishing this morning, Donald brought me this beautiful Walleye. I think it would cook into a fantastic Walleye en Papillote. Give it a try â don't forget the fresh Oregano and a vegetable too! Bon appÃ©tit!

Hey {PlayerName}, someone left me an unexpected gift at the restaurant, and I have no idea who it came from! Have you heard anything about this? While I appreciate the gift, I've got more soya and wheat than I need now. Maybe you could make some vegetarian dumplings? Just remember to add the vegetables! Bon appÃ©tit! Remy

{PlayerName}, I just managed to get a big discount on Wrought Iron! I'll be able to give you a lot more of it for each daily delivery from now on. It'll be a little easier to make tables and chairs now too, since this stuff is higher quality. And hey, I also threw in some Star Coins for you for your troubles! Can't wait to see what you make.

{PlayerName}, I've noticed that the grounds around the Dreamlight Library could perhaps look a tad more inviting. Decorating is not my forte... but I've assembled some materials that you ought to be able to make something out of. Might I suggest making some colorful lampposts for placement near the Library? It's up to you, of course.

TAG: CharacterMail!SwordInStone!Merlin_Mail001_MessageTitle
A small request.

TAG: CharacterMail!SwordInStone!Merlin_Mail002_Message
Dear {PlayerName}, I have been visited by a mysterious benefactor! Someone left a small package of precious gems for me in my Library. Little did they know, they gave me something much more valuable: a mystery! Please take these gems for your purposes, as I've no immediate use for them. Who could this Mystery Giver be? Most sincerely, Merlin

{PlayerName}, are you feeling run down? I couldn't help but notice the Village was looking a little tired, dear. I'm concerned! I thought perhaps you could liven things up with some flower beds to improve the look of the village. Of course you'll have to pick the blooms, but I can't do everything around here, can I?

Dear {PlayerName}, when I heard there was a mysterious gift giver in the Valley, I knew it was only a matter of time before I'd find a package on my doorstep. It wouldn't be my first secret admirer, unlike you. Oh, I'm just teasing! Well, I was given these materials and have no idea what to do with all this coal. But I do know you like to cook. I'm sure my admirer will soon remember that FLOWERS are far more appropriate. Your acquaintance, Mother Gothel

Hi {PlayerName}! I was just thinking about how great it would be for you to have a nice big table to work on. It would be good for art, or cooking or... well, ANYTHING! That's why I found you a bunch of materials to make a beautiful new table. Use it for whatever you like, but I just know it would look great in your home!

For your art?

TAG: CharacterMail!ToyStory!Buzz_Mail001_Message
Hey, Space Ranger! Have you considered adding more Crafting Stations around the Valley for easier access to your tools? I think it would be a game changer for your various projects. I scraped together a few supplies for another Crafting Station in case you agree and want to get started. Do whatever you want with them â just a suggestion of course!

Howdy {PlayerName}! By now you must've heard about this Mystery Giver sending gifts to everyone. Turns out today's my lucky day! Someone left a whole lot of wood at my place. Gotta hand it to 'em, that's pretty clever, considering my name's Woody. Anyway, I thought about using it to make ANOTHER toy box, but I figured you could build some new furniture instead. Hope it comes in handy. Your pal, Woody
