Mother Gothel... we need to talk.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Why, {PlayerName}, whatever about?

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
WALLÂ·E and I found this empty vial...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Yours, I presume?

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
A presumption indeed!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So, it's not yours?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Come on; it has to be yours!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do you know who it belongs to?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Why would there possibly be a fuss over an empty vial?

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
You're being awfully evasive.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Come now, {PlayerName}; a lady must have her secrets.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Well, it's less about the vial than what was supposed to be in that same area. WALLÂ·E's plant has gone missing.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Oh, you're worried about THAT little thing?

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Why didn't you say so?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I tried, but you were being really evasive!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I... uh... Never mind.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're right: I should have been more direct.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Hmmm, and whose fault is that, dear?

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
What happened to it?

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
Well, I could tell you... if you do something for me first.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Why am I not surprised you want something?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Fair is fair.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
What if I say "pretty please"?

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
So, you saw the plant?

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
I did indeed! My keen senses immediately detected something special about it.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
And?!

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Ooh, someone's in a hurry.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
*sigh* Fine. I brought the plant to Ursula, and she helped me examine it with a number of arcane techniques that I'm sure would be beyond your comprehension...

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
...

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
But the pathetic little weed was useless.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
Simply full of storybook magic, a trite and weak form of enchantment.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
Because you understand how the world works, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
OK, OK, what do you want?

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
Well, I used some rather precious ingredients trying to bring that plant back to health.

TAG: MotherGothel_025_f
If you bring me replacements... you'll have your information.

TAG: MotherGothel_026_f
Really? Do you want me to brew up a whole potion for you too?

TAG: MotherGothel_027_f
And trust you to do it correctly? Hardly. I'd much rather rely on Ursula's skills for that.

TAG: MotherGothel_028_f
Bring me <ActivityItem>Seaweed</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Cucumbers</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Sunflowers</ActivityItem>, and I'll tell you where the plant is.

TAG: MotherGothel_029_f
How mature of you!

TAG: MotherGothel_030_f
Oh, you can't possibly be serious! ... Wait, you are? Well, then...

TAG: MotherGothel_031_f
No.

TAG: MotherGothel_032_f
That's what I thought.

TAG: MotherGothel_033_f
At least you can admit your faults, darling.
