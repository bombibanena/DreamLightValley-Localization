Well... I suppose these will do.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
So, what did you do with the plant?

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
I threw it away.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
WHAT?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How could you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We were reading a story to it...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
I said I disposed of it. Really, dear, you should pay better attention.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Where did you throw it out?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
The rubbish pile, of course.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
... Mother Gothel, we don't have a rubbish pile in the Valley.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Of course we do! It's a nasty shade of yellow, rather rectangular, has a ramp in front...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Rubbish pile?! That's WALLÂ·E's home!

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
... Well, I'm not sure how to react to that without infuriating you further.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
I... Never mind. Thank you for telling us where you left it.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Goodbye, {PlayerName}! And I hope that's the last time you meddle with my belongings.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Well, it would have clashed terribly with the dÃ©cor here â surely you can see that?

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Oh... that is so pathetic; it must be true.
