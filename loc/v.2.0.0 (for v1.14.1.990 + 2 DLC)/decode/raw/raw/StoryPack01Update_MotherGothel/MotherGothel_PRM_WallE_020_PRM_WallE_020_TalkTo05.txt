So... how are you feeling about that, uh... magic moment with Merlin?

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Magical?! Ha!

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
That windbag's attitude only proved to show how unappreciated I am here. Why, he seemed almost offended!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's a crying shame!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Have you tried doing anything we could appreciate?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No need to get angry at Merlin.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Finally, someone understands! Merlin should have been thrilled to be seen in my company.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Ugh. Fine. I'll be a tad more charitable upon our next meeting. But no more than a tad.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Excellent!

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Well, Merlin's not the most sociable guy. Don't take it personally.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
In fact â he might have been intimidated by your wit and charm.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Very perceptive, {PlayerName}... I suppose anyone would be intimidated, wouldn't they?

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Poor Merlin was likely dazzled and not thinking straight.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
In any case... this was all WALLÂ·E's idea.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Really? Perhaps I underestimated the little rolling crate.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
I'll have to keep my eye on him.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Well, since you're feeling more cheerful, can you let bygones be bygones with Merlin?

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Gracing you with my presence should be more than enough! Why, Merlin ought to be flattered that I'd even give him the time of day.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Angry? He's not worth getting angry over. I'm merely appalled at his lack of taste.
