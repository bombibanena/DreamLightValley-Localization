Hey Donald, Olaf wanted me to give you these so you can write the scripts.

TAG: Donald_008_f
Now he wants me to write it all down for him...

TAG: Donald_009_f
...AND star in the hardest role in the whole play?!

TAG: Player_000_f
You think playing yourself would be hard?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I guess that's fair. You're very complex and layered.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I suppose it would be hard to keep up with your energy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you sure you don't just have stage fright?

TAG: Donald_001_f
WAK! What's the big idea?! He wants me to write the whole story down too?!

TAG: Donald_002_f
*grumble grumble*

TAG: Donald_003_f
Oh, and he wanted me to ask you one more thing...

TAG: Donald_004_f
Will you star in the play as yourself?

TAG: Donald_005_f
That's it! Olaf's making me do too much work!

TAG: Donald_006_f
I had to tell him the story over and over and over again... while eating popcorn...

TAG: Donald_007_f
You too, huh?

TAG: Donald_010_f
Exactly! It would take me weeks to get into character for it.

TAG: Donald_011_f
I'm done. Tell Olaf he can write the script himself!

TAG: Donald_012_f
And he better find somebody good to play Donald Duck, because Donald Duck's not gonna do it!

TAG: Donald_013_f
Exactly! It's exhausting being me! Imagine how exhausting it would be to be me playing me!

TAG: Donald_014_f
Stage fright?! That's preposterous! I'm a stupendous actor.
