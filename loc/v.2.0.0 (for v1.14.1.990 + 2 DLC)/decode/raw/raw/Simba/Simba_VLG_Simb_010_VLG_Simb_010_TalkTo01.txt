Wow! That does look more comfortable, {PlayerName}. Timon and Pumbaa would approve.

TAG: Simba_005_f
But I don't think comfort is everyone's problem. Some folks around here are just downright cranky.

TAG: Simba_006_f
Maybe a change of scenery would help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What could make it more relaxing?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Some people are just cranky by nature...

TAG: Simba_012_f
Great! So, I've been thinking...

TAG: Simba_013_f
Growing up in the jungle with Timon and Pumbaa helped me a lot. There was an oasis there where we could really relax.

TAG: Simba_015_f
And relaxing is a lot easier when the place you live is peaceful.

TAG: Simba_001_f
There was all this green, lush jungle and lots of places just to sit and enjoy the moment.

TAG: Simba_016_f
What if the Meadow could feel like that?

TAG: Simba_017_f
Yes! I'll make it so relaxing you'll feel like you're back in the oasis. I'll start by putting down some <ActivityItem>Seating</ActivityItem> and add to the <ActivityItem>Landscape</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Simba_014_f
Heh. Maybe you're right. But still. We could try.
