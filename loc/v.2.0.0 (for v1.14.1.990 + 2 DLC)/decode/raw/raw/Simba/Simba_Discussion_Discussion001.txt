Say, {PlayerName}. What do you think's the most important part of being a good king?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Balance.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Respect.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Power.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Right... Everything exists in a delicate balance. I need to remember that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What if you slip up?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds hard.

TAG: Simba_002_f
Then you have to find the balance again. Everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is that you learn from them.

TAG: Simba_009_f
When I was a cub, I thought being king meant you could do whatever you wanted. But I know that's not true now.

TAG: Simba_010_f
If you had a choice, {PlayerName}, do you think you'd want to be a ruler?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I already am.

TAG: Simba_011_f
I respect that, though I hope it's for the right reasons.

TAG: Simba_012_f
I don't blame you. Being king is a tough job.

TAG: Simba_013_f
I guess this Village is your kingdom, isn't it? Well, I hope you rule it well.

TAG: Simba_003_f
It is hard. But it's also very important.

TAG: Simba_004_f
That is important. I have to respect all the creatures in my kingdom, from the ants to the antelope.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
And meerkats.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
But ants are small.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
But you eat antelope.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Hey, have you been talking to my friend Timon? Heh-heh.

TAG: Simba_006_f
They may be small, but they're still important.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Yep. And someday, I'll die, and my body will feed the grass. The antelope will eat the grass. It's all part of the Circle of Life.

TAG: Simba_008_f
That sounds like something Scar would say.
