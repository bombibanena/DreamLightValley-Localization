Hey, Nala. {PlayerName} and I missed you at the partyâ

TAG: Simba_000_f
Party?! Simba, we were supposed to meet to scout for food.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Oh no! That was today...?

TAG: Simba_002_f
Yes. I know you wanted to have a gathering, but you also said you'd help me.

TAG: Simba_003_f
And that's not all. Some of my memories of the Valley are starting to come back.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I remember that you used to have some sort of special role here, Simba.

TAG: Simba_004_f
I think we need to figure out what it was. Or bad things will keep happening here.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I'm sorry, Nala! I honestly just forgot.

TAG: Simba_007_f
And you're right. We need to figure out this memory you've had.
