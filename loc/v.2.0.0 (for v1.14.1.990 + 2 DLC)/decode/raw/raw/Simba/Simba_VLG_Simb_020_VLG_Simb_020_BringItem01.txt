But I guess we still need to figure out who to invite to our gathering. What if we start with three that others look up to and would want to follow?

TAG: Player_000_f
We need to invite...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...someone fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...a Villager so nice they'll put everybody at ease.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...a hero with many stories to tell.

TAG: Simba_004_f
You mean like Goofy? Something funny always seems to happen when he's around.

TAG: Simba_000_f
He reminds me a little of Pumbaa.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Wow, I think we have the perfect guest list.

TAG: Simba_007_f
I'll invite them on your behalf. You try to think of where we can have the gathering. I'll be right back.

TAG: Simba_006_f
Okay, now who else?

TAG: Simba_008_f
Well, that has to be Minnie. She's always so kind to everyone.

TAG: Simba_009_f
Maybe Maui? He's even wearing some of his stories on his skin. It's pretty impressive.
