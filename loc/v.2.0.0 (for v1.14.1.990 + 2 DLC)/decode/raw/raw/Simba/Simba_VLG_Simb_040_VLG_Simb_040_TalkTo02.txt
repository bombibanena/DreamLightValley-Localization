Wow, {PlayerName}. This is incredible! There are trees growing all over the Valley. It really feels like the balance has been restored. And everything kind of smells different, don't you think?

The human nose is less sensitive than a lion's...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The lion smell overpowers the rest.

I wonder what Nala will think of all of this. I bet she'll be pretty excited.

TAG: Simba_007_f
I want to see the look on her face when she finds out too!

TAG: Simba_008_f
Let's go find her!

TAG: Simba_004_f
Oh. Well, trust me. Something's definitely different.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Hey! ... Aw, I'm just kidding. Every creature has a different scent. Just wait till you meet a warthog. Anyway...
