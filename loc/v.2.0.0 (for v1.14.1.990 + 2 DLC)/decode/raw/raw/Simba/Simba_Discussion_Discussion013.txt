Hey, {PlayerName}. I'm heading out for a trip around the Sunlit Plateau with Nala.

TAG: Simba_001_f
We're gonna visit all our old haunts. The water hole. The bendy tree.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is this a date?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds like fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What about the Elephant Graveyard?

TAG: Simba_002_f
A date...?

TAG: Simba_003_f
You know. Doing something with someone you love. Usually you give them flowers and chocolates.

TAG: Simba_004_f
So... I should get some flowers for Nala? I don't know if she'd like that.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Ah, forget it. I guess it's just a silly human thing.

TAG: Simba_006_f
It'll be nice to have some time together, just the two of us.

TAG: Simba_007_f
I think we'll steer clear of that place.

TAG: Simba_008_f
Too many bad memories.
