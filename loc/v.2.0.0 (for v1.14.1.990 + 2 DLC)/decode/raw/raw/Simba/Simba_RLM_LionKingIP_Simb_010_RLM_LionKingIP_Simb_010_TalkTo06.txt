There's a river that used to run through here. It fed the oasis and kept the plants alive.

But the river's blocked. Looks like there was some kind of mudslide.

I've been trying to dig it out with my paws, but there's a giant rock blocking the flow of the water.

Maybe if I could use my Pickaxe to break it, we could get the water flowing again.

You really think you can break that rock? That would be great!
