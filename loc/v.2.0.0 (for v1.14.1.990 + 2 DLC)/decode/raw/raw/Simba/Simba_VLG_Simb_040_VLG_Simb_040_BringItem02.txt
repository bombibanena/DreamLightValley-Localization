Hey, {PlayerName}, Mother Gothel came by to see me. She was... helpful. In a way.

TAG: Simba_010_f
Anyway, once you've watered enough of them, we'll go back to the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem> on the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Simba_001_f
And pretty soon, new <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Trees</ActivityItem> will grow.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's amazing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So our trees are networking?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It sounds a little... convenient.

TAG: Simba_000_f
She sort of reminds me of my uncle Scar... Which means, you should definitely be careful around her.

TAG: Simba_011_f
Anyway, she wanted me to tell you what you need to do next...

TAG: Simba_004_f
First, choose the part of the Valley where you want to grow a new <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>, then water the <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem> there.

TAG: Simba_012_f
Watering <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem> to grow a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>. Sounds a little strange, but okay...

TAG: Simba_013_f
Mother Gothel said that the roots of <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Trees</ActivityItem> stem from both the one above the Well in the Plaza and the one we planted together...

TAG: Simba_005_f
And they span the whole Valley.

TAG: Simba_006_f
Watering <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem> with a special <ActivityItem>Fertilizer</ActivityItem> helps the water reach the roots of the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Simba_014_f
So new sprouts can grow there. Then we'll have trees all over the Valley.

TAG: Simba_002_f
Yeah, I thought so too.

TAG: Simba_008_f
I guess there's only one way to know if it works. I'll go to the Frosted Heights, Forgotten Lands and Glade of Trust to water some <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Simba_009_f
If it works there, it'll work anywhere in the Valley.

TAG: Simba_015_f
Sounds good. I can't wait to see what happens.

TAG: Simba_016_f
I don't know what you mean... but they're connected. That's for sure.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Well, maybe it won't be as simple as it sounds.
