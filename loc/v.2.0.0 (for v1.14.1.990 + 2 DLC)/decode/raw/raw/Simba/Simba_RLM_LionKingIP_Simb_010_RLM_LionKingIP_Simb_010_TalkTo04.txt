Huh? That looks just like <ActivityItem>Rafiki's Walking Stick</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Simba_002_f
You're not gonna bop me on the head with it, are you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course not!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We need it for a spell.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Only if you want me to.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Good.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Merlin told me that to cast this spell, I'd need to start by finding something to remind you of the past.

TAG: Simba_008_f
Well, that definitely works. Just looking at that thing makes me think of all the things Rafiki's told me.

TAG: Simba_009_f
Then I think it's time for the next part of the enchantment.

TAG: Simba_010_f
Stand back. This is going to take a lot of Dreamlight Magic to cast. Merlin says it might be dangerous.

TAG: Simba_011_f
I don't think we'll be able to try this twice if it goes wrong...

TAG: Simba_004_f
A... spell?

TAG: Simba_005_f
That's okay. I'm not really looking for a headache today.
