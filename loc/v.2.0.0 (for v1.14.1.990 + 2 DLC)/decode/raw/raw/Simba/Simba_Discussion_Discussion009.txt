Ya know, {PlayerName}, some folks think I'm lazy...

TAG: Simba_001_f
...because I'm always "lion" around.

TAG: Simba_002_f
You get it? "Lion" around?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh no. That's a terrible pun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Who'd you learn that joke from?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
At least you're honest and not a "cheetah."

TAG: Simba_003_f
You think so...? I thought I'd try it out, just to see.

TAG: Simba_004_f
I told Timon and Pumbaa it wasn't funny, but they said it was.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Some hyenas. But then my friends, Timon and Pumbaa said it was pretty funny.

TAG: Simba_006_f
Guess their sense of humor rubbed off on me a bit. Or maybe a lot.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Oh wow! Good one! I'm gonna have to remember that.
