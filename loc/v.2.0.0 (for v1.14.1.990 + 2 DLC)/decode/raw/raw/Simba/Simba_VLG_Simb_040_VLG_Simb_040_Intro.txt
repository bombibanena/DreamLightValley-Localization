{PlayerName}, I'd like to take a closer look at the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fruit</ActivityItem>. Can you help me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not right now.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Since the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem> grew on the Sunlit Plateau, I've started to remember more about my past here.

TAG: Simba_009_f
There used to be more than one <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem> around the Valley. It would be great if we could bring the others back.

TAG: Simba_011_f
That way, every creature in the Valley can enjoy them no matter where they live.

TAG: Simba_010_f
So, I was thinking, maybe the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fruit</ActivityItem> that grows on the tree can help us do that...

TAG: Simba_002_f
I want to examine them up close, but every time I try to grab one, I end up squashing it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Let me get them for you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I didn't know lions were expert gardeners?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Squashed fruit... You should bake it into a pie.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Simba_003_f
I'm not, but I'd just like to take a look at it. Maybe it'll help me remember more. Could you grab some for me?

TAG: Simba_007_f
Bake it into a what...?

TAG: Simba_008_f
I'll ask Remy about that later. For now, could you just grab some for me?

TAG: Simba_004_f
That's okay. Please come find me when you can.
