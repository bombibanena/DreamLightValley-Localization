It's great being back here with Nala. Last time, we didn't get to explore much.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I want to do something special for her. Show her what life was like for me with Timon and Pumbaa.

TAG: Simba_007_f
And a special occasion in the jungle always calls for grubs!

TAG: Player_000_f
Grubs...? Wait, like... bugs?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds tasty.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Ewwww! Yuck.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
As long as I don't need to eat any.

TAG: Simba_008_f
They are! Nala doesn't think they'll taste good, but I bet we can prove her wrong.

TAG: Simba_011_f
I'll just need some help finding everything.

TAG: Simba_012_f
There are some really <ActivityItem>Slimy Bugs</ActivityItem> that you can fish out of the river around here.

TAG: Simba_013_f
And there are some really <ActivityItem>Colorful Bugs</ActivityItem> just outside the jungle, in the dried-out oasis.

TAG: Simba_000_f
Okay, I'll go collect those while you get everything ready here.

TAG: Simba_009_f
Yeah, that's what Nala thinks too. But I bet you'll both change your minds.

TAG: Simba_010_f
You don't. But when you see how tasty they look, you'll change your mind.
