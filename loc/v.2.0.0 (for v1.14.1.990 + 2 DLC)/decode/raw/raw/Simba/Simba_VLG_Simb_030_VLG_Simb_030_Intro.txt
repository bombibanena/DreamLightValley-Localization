Hey, {PlayerName}. Do you have time to help me figure out more about my past here in the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll come back later.

TAG: Simba_004_f
Thanks. I don't remember much, but I do know it's important to the Valley that I uncover my past.

TAG: Simba_001_f
I know I had a role here, something I was responsible for â like Nala said.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I want to figure it out. But I don't know where to start.

TAG: Player_001_f
We need someone who remembers EVERYTHING about the Village. Someone who was protected from the Forgetting by being trapped in a certain giant skull cave. We need Scar...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Don't worry. I'll handle the discussion.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I know you don't like dealing with him.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm sorry, Simba.

TAG: Simba_006_f
You just stay here. I'll talk to him. I know he's tricky.

TAG: Simba_009_f
I don't like this.

TAG: Simba_010_f
But I guess there's no other choice.

TAG: Simba_011_f
If there's no one else here who knows about my past... then, you're right, you'll have to talk to him.

TAG: Simba_007_f
That's what my friend Timon would call an understatement.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Thanks. Maybe if I keep trying, I'll remember more on my own.
