I'm starting to remember something, {PlayerName}. You and Remy used the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fruit</ActivityItem> in a bunch of recipes...

TAG: Simba_008_f
But I'm still not sure if the fruit will help us get more <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Trees</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Simba_003_f
Maybe I knew once.

TAG: Simba_006_f
For now, the only other thing I remember is Mother Gothel sometimes picked the fruit.

TAG: Simba_000_f
Do you think she knows something?

TAG: Player_000_f
I'll talk to her...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She'll want to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't think she likes lions too much.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She's difficult to deal with.

TAG: Simba_001_f
That'd be great. Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Simba_004_f
Yeah. Some folks are a little wary around us.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Good luck, then. Thanks, {PlayerName}.
