{PlayerName}? Well, I was looking for Scar, but never mind that. You and I are long past due for a chat.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Go ahead. Yell at me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've got nothing to talk to you about.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're just going to tell me what to do like everyone else.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Yell at you...? Why would I...? Oh, no, no, no! I'm not angry.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They don't feel very powerful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You don't know what you're talking about.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Leave me alone.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I'm... well, I'm rather worried. Of course I'm concerned about all that's going on in the Village... but it's you I'm most worried about.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Well... you don't have to worry.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
<Forgotten>(Because I'll run away. I'll run away and never return...)</Forgotten>

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Please, {PlayerName}... let me explain... You, well, er, you don't even have to listen if you don't care to.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Now then... it's only natural that as you mature, there will be parts of yourself you question â things you wish to leave behind.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
But there are some things you must never lose faith in.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Friendship, love, acts of care for one another... they're the most powerful magic of all.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
And they're the greatest forces in Dreamlight Valley, or... well... anywhere!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Ah... I see. Sometimes, when we feel cut off from love, from friendship, it might appear that way. But impressions can be misleading.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
We all care deeply about you. I promise: Love and friendship are always here for you when you're in need of them.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're lying.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You'll never understand.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Love and friendship... What a joke.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Every word I've said is the truth.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Be careful of the path you're walking down, {PlayerName}... I implore you.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Some things must never be forgotten.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
<Forgotten>(Some things... must be... Forgotten...)</Forgotten>

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Perhaps not. But I'll never stop my pursuit of knowledge, or trying to aid you.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
You must not let yourself believe that!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
I may not know half as much as I wish to. But what I've just told you is one thing I am quite certain about.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
I shall, in just a moment. I have one last thing to say...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Please. Just lend your ear for a moment.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
No, no, no, I've no desire to tell you what to do. I only wish to try and help.
