Bravo! You've found enough <ActivityItem>Forgotten Relics</ActivityItem> for us to proceed with the enchantment!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
The magic coming off of them is stronger than anything the Forgotten left behind. And it's story magic; of that I'm certain.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
We mustn't tarry a moment longer. Are you ready to <Lore>pass through and explore the Dark Castle</Lore>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I've never been more ready.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm scared... but I'll fight through it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe we could get Donald to do this instead?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Confidence! That's exactly what you'll need, {PlayerName}. With confidence, I know you can face any challenge.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
You've learned a great deal since that first day you returned to the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It feels like yesterday.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That seems so long ago...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
To you. To me, it seems as though I've barely blinked my eyes, and yet so much time has passed.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
You've become the ruler that Dreamlight Valley needs. Look around at all you've done, all the friends you've brought back. {PlayerName}... I'm proud of you.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Now, <Lore>follow me</Lore>, and let's set the world right before I devolve into unbearable sentiment.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Yes, I believe you will. And that's true courage, isn't it? Recognizing our fears and facing them.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Donald may be very brave, but the last time he found himself on the other side of a Dark Portal, he spent far too long wandering around a foggy forest.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
You can do this, {PlayerName}. In fact... ONLY you can do this.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Your final lesson is to know when to trust in yourself. You've learned a great deal since that first day you returned to the Valley.
