Oh dear, {PlayerName}, you look worried. Is there something I can help you with?

TAG: Player_000_f
Yes. The Fairy Godmother is pretty tired. I think she could use some help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm very worried.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you have a potion to help her?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Should I expect some kind of hilarious magic catastrophe?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Yes well, I suppose I have noticed that she's been working rather hard.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Ha-ha! You didn't think I noticed, did you?

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Well, the Fairy Godmother kept it for so long, it's practically hers already.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Great. I'm thinking we could add some <ActivityItem>Mint Chocolate</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>White Impatiens</ActivityItem> in a <ActivityItem>Basket</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
And I'll ask for some advice from someone who knows how to pamper herself: Ursula...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
And she does so much for the Village... You're quite right! It's only fair that we take care of her, too.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Let's put together a <ActivityItem>Care Package</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Marvelous idea!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
But we could go even further. Shall we organize something to make sure the Fairy Godmother knows how much she's appreciated?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Like a party?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Precisely! I'll organize a get-together to show her we care.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Yes, yes... I'll invite some Villagers, and you... you craft this <ActivityItem>Care Package</ActivityItem> of yours.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
And I know just what you can add to it. This <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> you snuck back on my bookshelf.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
A potion? No, no, that will never do! In cases like this, the best way to take care of someone doesn't involve magic.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
No, we must think of something else...

TAG: Merlin_016_f
You mustn't laugh about these things, {PlayerName}. Imagine if it was you who got turned into a pumpkin. Now, what should we do...

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Now, what should we do...?
