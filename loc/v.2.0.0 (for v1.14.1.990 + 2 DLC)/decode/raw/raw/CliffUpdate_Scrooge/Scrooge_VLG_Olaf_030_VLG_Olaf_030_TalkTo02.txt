Ya want me to audition for a play?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Hmm... And what'll the salary be?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
... Zero Star Coins.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The love of an adoring crowd.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The satisfaction of a job well done.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Och! Doesn't sound like there's much profit in acting here, is there?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Well, how much of my time will I be needin' to invest?

TAG: Player_001_f
Well, you'll need to learn all the lines, attend rehearsals, do the performances...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It'll be a lot of work.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You can probably just wing it, though?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Curse me kilts! Sounds like ya want me to invest hours of my very valuable time for no return.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I'll have to think on it... What's the part?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Donald Duck.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Uh... a certain nephew of yours.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Ya want me to play my nephew Donald?

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
No deal! Even if the returns were worth my time, I cannae begin to fathom the workings of that lad's mind.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Best of luck finding someone who can!
