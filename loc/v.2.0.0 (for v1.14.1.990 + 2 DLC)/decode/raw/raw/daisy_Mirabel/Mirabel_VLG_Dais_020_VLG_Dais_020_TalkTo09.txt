Hola, {PlayerName}! Wow, you look busier than my sister Luisa on "move the donkeys to the pasture" day. What's going on?

I'm helping Minnie and Daisy launch their fashion line: Dots & Daisies. They need a <ActivityItem>Sewing Machine</ActivityItem> to get started.

TAG: Player_000_f
Do you have an extra one they could borrow?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They'd really appreciate it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It would help a lot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can you believe they don't already have one?

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
I can do better than that â I can give them a sewing machine to keep! I have an extra one I never use.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
That's so great! Muchas gracias, Mirabel!

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
De nada! Ooh, maybe I can have a sewing party with them.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Well, sometimes you miss the forest for the sewing machine!

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
... That joke was funnier in my head. ANYWAY!

TAG: Mirabel_000_f
I can't lend them a sewing machine.
