What's this, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
A gift from Ursula. She made this so it smells like your favorite thing in the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Ah... Well, thank you for delivering it.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
You're not going to open it?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Not without taking the necessary precautions!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, that's probably wise.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I have no opinion on this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's a little mean.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
It never hurts to be careful around witches. Particularly THAT one.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
You don't need one. Just remember to take care around the Sea Witch.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Perhaps, but I've learned to be careful around Ursula. She's as crafty as they come!
