You've done a wonderful job, {PlayerName}! The <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem> looks as good as new â both elegant and useful!

You know, seeing you do so many useful things reminds me of the Cheerful Chums Club.

What's the Cheerful Chums Club?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I like being useful!

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Well, I don't recall exactly who was in the club.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
But I know we made sure everyone in the Village had what they needed.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
If the club were around today, I might just nominate you to be the president!

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Oh, before I forget, I made these clothes as a thank-you present for all your wonderful work.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
I hope you like them!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
And we're all very grateful for your help!
