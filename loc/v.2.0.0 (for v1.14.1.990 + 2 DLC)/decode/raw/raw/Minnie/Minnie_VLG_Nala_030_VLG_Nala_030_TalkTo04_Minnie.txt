{PlayerName}, I'm so glad you're here. I'm worried about the strange things that have been happening in the Village.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
It's like what happened before. I hope I don't start disappearing again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's not going to happen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I need your help to fix this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm scared we're ALL going to start disappearing soon.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Oh, I know you'll do everything you can to fix things. And I'll help however I can.

TAG: Minnie_000_f
I hope you don't mind if I cut this up into a few pieces.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
Oh please, do whatever you need to do.

TAG: Minnie_015_f
I can always replace a bow.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
But the Here and There... being stuck between worlds... it's so scary. I won't let that happen to anyone ever again.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
That's actually exactly why I'm here.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Nala and I are trying to perform an enchantment to fix the rifts in the Valley. We need something from you.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
From me? But why?

TAG: Minnie_009_f
The rifts lead to the Here and There. To stop them, we need something that's also been to the Here and There.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
Is there anything you can give us? Something you had on you when you disappeared?

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Of course! Here. Take this.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
I was wearing that bow when I first started to disappear.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
You do? What do you need? I'll do whatever I can to help.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Well, I'll do whatever I can to help you stop that from happening.
