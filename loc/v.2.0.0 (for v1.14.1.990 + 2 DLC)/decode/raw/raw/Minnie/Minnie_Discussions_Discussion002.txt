You know, {PlayerName}, I'm actually glad we have some villains in the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Me too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're dangerous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Villains are cool.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
I think it means we have the chance to show them the value of kindness.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
If they see how much good comes from helping others, maybe they'll change their perspectives.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That would be great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Kindness? Sounds boring.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Wouldn't it? Let's be sure to set good examples.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Hmm... Well, I think if you tried it, you'd find it's very rewarding.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Oh, I'm not sure I'd go that far. There's a reason they're called "villains"! Besides...
