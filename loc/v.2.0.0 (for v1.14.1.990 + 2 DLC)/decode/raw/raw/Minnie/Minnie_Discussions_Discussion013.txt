I've been thinking, {PlayerName}... Isn't it interesting how all the parts of the Valley are so different?

TAG: Minnie_001_f
Just walking through the Village, I can visit a forest, a meadow, or a beach!

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Do you have a favorite?

The Forest of Valor.

The Peaceful Meadow.

Dazzle Beach.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Oh, I like the forest, too. The tall trees and their long cool shadows...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
And all the adorable little forest creatures scurrying about.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
What do you like to do in the forest?

Wander and explore!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Usually just fetch things for people.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
That sounds like fun! Perhaps we can play sometime.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
Well, there's certainly a lot to explore.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
It's nice that we can help out, isn't it?

TAG: Minnie_004_f
The Meadow is very lovely and so open.

I like picking flowers and relaxing in the clover.

Me too! It's a perfect place to sit and enjoy the breeze.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
The Meadow is a wonderful place for that. There's so much space!

TAG: Minnie_005_f
I do like sitting on the Beach and watching the waves.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
And sometimes I collect seashells, too.

The water here is perfect for that. Especially on a hot day.

You should talk to Mickey. He's very good at building sandcastles.

TAG: Minnie_019_f
Maybe he could give you some pointers.
