Excuse me, Ms. Gothel?

TAG: Minnie_001_f
Hm? Yes, dear?

I was making some new bows, and I had some lovely dark red fabric...

TAG: Minnie_003_f
So I made this one, and I thought it would match your dress. Would you like it?

TAG: Minnie_004_f
... Well, it is rather fashionable, and I see you've sewn it with a backstitch. I'll consider wearing your creation as a favor to you.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Oh... well, here you go. (I suppose that's "villain" for "thank you.")
