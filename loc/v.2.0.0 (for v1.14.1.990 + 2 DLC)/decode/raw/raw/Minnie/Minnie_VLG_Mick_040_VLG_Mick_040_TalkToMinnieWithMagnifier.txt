Minnie! You've stopped disappearing! The Magnifier is working!

TAG: Minnie_001_f
You're right! I'm here! I'm...

TAG: Minnie_003_f
... Goodness, I'm sleepy. I don't feel quite like myself.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
It's almost like I'm missing an anchor... something to bring me back for good.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Oh. I feel like I've been wandering for ages.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
*yawn* I've never been so tired. If only I could lie down.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Where's my... I think I had... a House?

TAG: Minnie_008_f
With a bed in it. A soft bed. Do you think you could bring back my House?
