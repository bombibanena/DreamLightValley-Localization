You know, {PlayerName}, I've been thinking about the weather.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
Really? What's there to think about?

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Well, it's the one thing we all have in common.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Even if you haven't got anything else to talk about, you can always talk about the weather.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Huh. I guess that's true.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Not that I don't have many things to talk to you about. But if we didn't, we could comment on the fact that it's raining today.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
What's your favorite kind of weather?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Clear skies.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Rain.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Snow.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
That is nice. When the sky is clear, you can do so many things!

TAG: Minnie_011_f
You can go bicycling, or play a game, or go on a picnic.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
Or just sit outside and read a wonderful book.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Oh, I do like it when it rains sometimes.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
It's fun to go out with my umbrella and raincoat and smell the fresh air.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
But I also like listening to the rain from my window.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
Oh, snow is so much fun! You can do so many things with it...

TAG: Minnie_015_f
Make snowmen, or snow angels, or throw snowballs.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
And it's so pretty when it's all new and fresh.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
The weather's been so nice in the Village lately.
