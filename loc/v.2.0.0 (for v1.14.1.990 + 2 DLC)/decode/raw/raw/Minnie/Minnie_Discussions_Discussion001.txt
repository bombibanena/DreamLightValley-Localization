Isn't Mickey the sweetest? I'm so happy that we're together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why do you like him?

You seem perfect for each other.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You look really similar.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
Well, he cares about everyone, and he's so optimistic. And he always makes me laugh.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Me too! Mickey's so funny. It's one of my favorite things about him.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
That's very important! I love how clever Mickey is. He can find a smart solution to the stickiest problem.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
Oh. That's never been very important to us, but I hope you find whatever makes you happy.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
I think we are! But every relationship takes work. Mickey can be rather impulsive.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
And sometimes I can be a little stubborn. So, we do have the occasional argument.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
What do you do when you argue with someone you love?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Try to win.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Try to understand.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Cry.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
I can understand the temptation to try and argue your point.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
But when Mickey and I disagree, we always try to look at it from the other's point of view.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
That's a very good idea. I know it can be difficult in the moment.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
But I think it's wonderful that you try!

TAG: Minnie_015_f
Oh, I understand what you mean. Being upset with someone you love can hurt.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
I hope you always find a way through it.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Hee-hee! I suppose we do.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
And it's such a coincidence that we have the same last name. Isn't that funny?
