{PlayerName}, there's someone in the Village I'd like to talk to...

TAG: Minnie_001_f
...but I have to admit that I'm a little nervous about it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I get nervous about talking to people too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No need to be nervous! Everyone here is so nice.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Could you give me some advice?

TAG: Minnie_005_f
You see, I'd like to talk to Ursula.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Ursula? What do you want to talk to her about?

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Well, I like to be friends with all my neighbors, so I was hoping we could find some things in common.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
But I'm not sure she'd be open to it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Talk to her like you would anyone else.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
She's pretty friendly. Just don't sign any contracts.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Better not to talk to her. She's a villain.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Are you certain? Is it that easy?

TAG: Minnie_017_f
Definitely. I'll bet if you give Ursula a compliment, you'll become her favorite Villager.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
Well, I'll give it a try. Thank you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Minnie_012_f
Oh, I'd never do that! I know she's a villain.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
But everyone should have a few friends.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
Oh, I know that. But everyone should have a few friends.

TAG: Minnie_015_f
I'll think about it. Thank you for always looking out for us, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
It can be scary to talk to someone new...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
...especially when that someone is Ursula.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
That's true. Most everyone here is...

TAG: Minnie_007_f
...but I was hoping to talk to Ursula.
