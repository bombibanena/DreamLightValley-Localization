Hello, {PlayerName}. What's wrong? You look worried.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Scar is plotting against you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Scar is manipulating you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I know you and Scar are working together!

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
Scar? Why would he be plotting against me?

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
Scar has been having secret meetings with Ursula and Mother Gothel, and I found these mysterious diary entries...

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
I even took some pictures!

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Oh! No, {PlayerName}, you have it all wrong! No one is planning anything evil...

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
I introduced some of the Villagers to poetry recently!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Seriously?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I should have known this was about poetry...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Are you SURE this isn't some grand evil scheme?

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
Yes, I thought it would help with some of the more difficult emotions around here.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Scar really took to it, but he wanted to keep it quiet to "protect his reputation." Maybe you noticed Scar's poem was handwritten? He dictated, and I wrote it out for him.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Scar... writing poetry...

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Timon is going to LOVE this!

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
Poetry has helped me deal with a lot of my difficult emotions.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
I'm sure.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Poetry has helped me deal with a lot of my difficult emotions.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
What do you mean?

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
I wouldn't call it work...

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
But you admit it? So Scar doesn't want to overthrow you? You're actually plotting WITH him?

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
Wait, what are you talking about?
