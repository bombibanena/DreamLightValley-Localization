Remy! How would you feel about getting a nice day off?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Well, a day off's always great. But what's the catch?

... Hades will be filling in for you.

Does... does he even know how to cook?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I hope so.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
... Yes?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Frankly, no idea.

He was hyping up his Grecian Baked Fish recipe to me.

TAG: Remy_000_f
I don't know. Hades doesn't exactly inspire trust...

TAG: Remy_007_f
What if I keep an eye on him to make sure things don't go too wild?

TAG: Remy_010_f
Well in that case, I think I could be persuaded to take a little time off.

TAG: Remy_011_f
If Hades thinks he can handle running Chez Remy, let him try!

TAG: Remy_012_f
Great!

TAG: Remy_013_f
If he's planning on making Greek food, could you make sure he has enough Ingredients in stock?

And if you need a refresher on how to make a <ActivityItem>Grecian Baked Fish</ActivityItem>, I think I have a recipe floating around my House.

Perfect, thanks Remy.
