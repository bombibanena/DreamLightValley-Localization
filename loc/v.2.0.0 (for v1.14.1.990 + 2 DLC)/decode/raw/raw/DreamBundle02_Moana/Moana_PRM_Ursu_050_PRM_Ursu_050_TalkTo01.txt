Is there anything I can do for you, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Moana_003_f
Well, there's something you promised Ursula...

TAG: Moana_004_f
Oh no!

TAG: Moana_005_f
I forgot Ursula!

TAG: Moana_006_f
She gave me this amazing star chart of the sky around the Valley... And I got totally lost in it.

TAG: Moana_007_f
It completely slipped my mind to get back to her.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Maybe you can just tell me the advice and I...

TAG: Moana_009_f
No, I can do better than that. I'm going to make her some coconut oil for her hair!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Wow, so simple.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I should've known.

Somewhere Maui is yelling, "You're welcome!"

TAG: Moana_010_f
Yes, but it works really well!

TAG: Moana_014_f
Why don't I help you whip up some coconut oil for her?

TAG: Moana_015_f
That would be great! We need someone to shred the coconuts...

TAG: Moana_016_f
Oh, I bet WALLÂ·E can probably do it in the blink of an eye! I'll bring him some <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem> and be right back.

TAG: Moana_017_f
You're amazing!

TAG: Moana_011_f
What can I say? The coconut is a pretty incredible fruit.

TAG: Moana_012_f
And in this case, he's right.
