Mickey! Can we talk food for a moment?

You bet, {PlayerName}!

Great! I'm trying to figure out how to make this dish I saw in a memory â and which Villager made it.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Do you remember sharing a Cajun meal in the Glade of Trust with some other Villagers?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Merlin remembered some <ActivityItem>Enchanted Chili Peppers</ActivityItem> and Moana told me about the <ActivityItem>Onions</ActivityItem> in the dish.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Gosh, let me think for a minute...

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Anything bubbling to the surface?

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Wait... Yeah! I remember the dish was based on <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mickey_012_f
It was super fluffy and perfectly cooked. It was like each bite of rice brought all the other flavors together!

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Perfect; thanks, Mickey!

TAG: Mickey_013_f
I think I have all the info I'll need to make it! I'll be sure to swing by to give you a taste once it's ready.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Time to keep hunting for the other Ingredients! See ya!
