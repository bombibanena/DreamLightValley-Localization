Hi, Scar. You look... agitated.

TAG: Scar_018_f
Oh I do, do I?

TAG: Scar_004_f
I know what that insolent little Vanellope creature tried to leave in my den.

TAG: Scar_010_f
And... I know that you took care of it. I suppose a show of gratitude is in order.

TAG: Scar_020_f
Keeping the Villagers safe and happy is my number one priority... ALL of the Villagers.

TAG: Scar_021_f
I'll make sure nothing like this happens to you again.

TAG: Scar_022_f
And I do appreciate that.

TAG: Scar_019_f
What happened?

TAG: Scar_017_f
I'm certain that insolent little Vanellope creature has been spying on me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why do you think that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Vanellope would never do such a thing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She does give off a mischievous vibe, doesn't she?

TAG: Scar_002_f
I've seen her lurking about, like a predator stalking prey.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Must be strange for you to be on the other side of that, huh?

TAG: Scar_013_f
Hardly. It's not as if the child could truly harm me. But she is exceedingly annoying.

TAG: Scar_014_f
Listen, I'll take care of whatever Vanellope is up to. Just... try not to get too worked up over this, okay?

TAG: Scar_015_f
Not to worry, {PlayerName}. I am imperturbable.

TAG: Scar_016_f
Sure you are, Scar.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Please. She has "bothersome brat" written all over her.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Don't be mean. Vanellope is sweet!

TAG: Scar_007_f
Ugh.

TAG: Scar_008_f
But you have a little mischief in you, too, don't you?

TAG: Scar_011_f
{PlayerName}, I am wickedly clever, cunning, ruthless, determined, perhaps mildly vengeful... but mischievous?

TAG: Scar_012_f
To boil royalty such as me down to one simplistic, juvenile word is disrespect of the highest order.
