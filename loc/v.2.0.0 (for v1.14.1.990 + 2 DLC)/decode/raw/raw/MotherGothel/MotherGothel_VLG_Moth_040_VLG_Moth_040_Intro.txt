{PlayerName}, it took me HOURS of work, tireless research, and an uninvited visit to Merlin's library, but I've finally learned how to restore the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
How can I help?

TAG: Player_002_choice_004_f
No. Not helping you right now...

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
I'll get to that, you can be sure.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Oh, how lucky you are that I'm here, {PlayerName}. Someone less... gifted would never have figured it out.

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
It's only because of me that there's hope of restoring the Giant Willow in the Glade.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Believe me, I know!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What did you discover?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Get to the point...

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
And that's why you're my favorite. Now...

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Neither the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem>, nor the symbols in the Mystical Cave said anything about how to put the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem> back together...

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Or what to do in case of dimmed <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem>. But did I let that stop me? Of course not.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
I discovered that the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>'s heart must be made of a piece of the sun. So that is what we need.

TAG: Player_000_choice_012_f
Am I going to fly to the sun?

TAG: Player_000_choice_017_f
How do we get that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_018_f
On the sun, the floor is LITERALLY lava. I'm not going up there.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Don't be ridiculous, dear. We're going to make it come to us.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
I've uncovered a spell that calls for a shower of <ActivityItem>Sun Meteorites</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
But first, we need to restore the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem>. I can't call for the shower without their power.

TAG: Player_000_choice_019_f
I'm going to make so many wishes during the shower!

TAG: Player_000_choice_020_f
What do I do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_021_f
I hope no <ActivityItem>Sun Meteorites</ActivityItem> fall on my head.

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
Eh-eh-eh. Priorities, {PlayerName}. We must ensure that it happens.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
We'll start with the <ActivityItem>Dawn Fragment</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_027_f
To be restored, it must be infused with Ingredients as fresh as the morning to "remind" it of its nature and awaken it.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
You'll have to gather <ActivityItem>Lemon</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Oregano</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Mint</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Ocean Water</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Then, submerge the <ActivityItem>Dawn Fragment</ActivityItem> in a pot with these Ingredients like you would for any meal.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Return to me the moment that you've finished.

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
Wouldn't that be a sight to see? For now...

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
And no one said that you would, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Always so dreadfully direct, {PlayerName}...

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Another disappointment... I should be used to this by now.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Very well. When you decide the fate of your Village is important, I'll be here... waiting.
