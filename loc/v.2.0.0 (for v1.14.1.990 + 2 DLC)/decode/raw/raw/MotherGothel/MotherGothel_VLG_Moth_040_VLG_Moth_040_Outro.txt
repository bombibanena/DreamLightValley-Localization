The <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>! Finally!

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
I can already feel its effect. I'll stay young and beautiful forever!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You look younger than me...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You look just like...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess youth is in the eye of the beholder...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Of course I do, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
Maintaining my youth is only a fraction of the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>'s power. When I place it in the Giant Willow, it will grace us all.

I am glad I let you help me, {PlayerName}. Getting the <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem> from that doddering fool, Scrooge...

Going to the Mystical Cave and finding the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem>...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
For being so good at running errands, I want to give you a present.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
I know you'll love it. And no, no, no! Don't give me anything in return, though of course you want to.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
I'm going to bathe in the rays of the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem> now. You should really consider it too. You look absolutely exhausted.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Just teasing, dear. Ta-ta!

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Don't you mean fabulous? And now there's no risk of that changing. Ever.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, don't be so negative when you talk about yourself.
