{PlayerName}! Did I see a gray hair in my reflection? Look at my hair. Is any of it gray?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No gray hairs.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I see one gray hair.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Lots of gray hairs!

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Oh, what a relief! One must be very careful about one's appearance, you know.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You look great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How old are you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I see a wrinkle.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
That's kind of you to say. Of course it's true, but it's still sweet of you to say it.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Didn't anyone ever teach you that it's impolite to ask a woman's age?

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
And I know you'd never be impolite to me. Isn't that right, dear?

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
AHHHH! NO! MY BEAUTIFUL SKIN!

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Grrr... I must find Rapunzel quickly. If only she cared about her poor, dear mother.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're such a good mother.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You only want her hair.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
I am, aren't I? Why ever would Rapunzel run away? She's terribly ungrateful.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
What a horrid thing to say! I love my daughter.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
It's the cruelty of the world that wants to take advantage of her gift.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
No. NO! I'm becoming old and withered!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
You look fine.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
There's nothing wrong with getting old.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Yep.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
Do I? Well. Perhaps for now.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
But this is just the start. After the gray comes the wrinkles.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
I will NOT lose my youthfulness!

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
Ha! You're almost as deluded as my daughter.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
When you're old, the world discards you. You become... irrelevant. I WILL stay young, no matter the cost!

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
So cruel. When YOU are old, I hope YOU have an unfeeling reprobate who taunts you with it.
