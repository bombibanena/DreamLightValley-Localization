Ah, my favorite little assistant. You're just in time to hear my news about the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem> that you've been "helping" me track for some time now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Tell me EVERYTHING!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Meh... I don't want to deal with this now.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
After some brilliant deductions on my part, that picture you brought me back from the Mystical Cave showed me what happened to the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
To put it simply: It broke. I need you to find the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem> and bring them to me.

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
Only someone with Dreamlight Magic at their fingertips can gather the pieces of the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
And you're so good at fetching things. It really is your only talent, you know.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Oh, I'm just teasing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
I love your jokes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
Why are you so mean?

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
How about an apology or I don't do anything...?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Finally, someone who appreciates me. My daughter can be so ungrateful.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Now, about the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem>...

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Each of them will appear at a specific time and place. The <ActivityItem>Dawn Fragment</ActivityItem> in the morning on the Sunlit Plateau...

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
... The <ActivityItem>Noon Fragment</ActivityItem> at midday in the Glade, and the <ActivityItem>Dusk Fragment</ActivityItem> at night in the Forest.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
They'll glow like miniature suns on the ground, so you should find them easily. Collect them all, and bring them back to me.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Oh, don't be such a baby, {PlayerName}. I'm merely making sure you don't take yourself too seriously.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
You really should smile more. You don't want to get wrinkles, do you? After all, your face is plain enough as it is...

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Goodness, someone's being petulant today.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Fine then. I'm sorry...

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
You really should learn to take a joke. Being so serious all the time will give you wrinkles, dear. And trust me, your face is plain enough as it is...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
{PlayerName}... stop with the mumbling. I hate it when you mumble. Come see me as soon as possible. It's important.
