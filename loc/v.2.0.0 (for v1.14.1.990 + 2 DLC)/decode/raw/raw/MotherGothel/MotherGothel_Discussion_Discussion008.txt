{PlayerName}, you have my attention. Shall I give you some motherly advice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Okay!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're not my mother.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Your advice is kind of toxic.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Oh, it's so nice to have someone appreciate my kindness!

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Unlike some ungrateful children who will remain unnamed.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
What would you like advice about, dear?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Life.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Romance.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Reasons I shouldn't leave my tower.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Well, life is a race, {PlayerName}. If you're not winning, you're losing.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
And most people are forever losing. You must make sure you win â always.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Oh, my advice about romance is simple...

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Don't.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
It's never worth it. You can only depend on yourself.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
I see. Now you're the one teasing me. I'll remember that.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
True, but I give very good advice.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Toxic! Oh, I'm wounded, {PlayerName}!

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
I come to you offering nothing but support, and you insult me.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
*sigh* Fine. Give me some advice.
