Have you seen that absurd stall in the Meadow?

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Run by... who is it... Doofy? The selection is so paltry.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What do you mean?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I like Goofy's Stall.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Excuse me. His name is Goofy.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
The wares are nothing but bland, common items.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
It's completely useless if you're in need of more... unique... ingredients.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Like what?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you gonna brew evil potions?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You could talk to Goofy about it.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Well, as a purely theoretical example...

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
A youth serum.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Or parsnips.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Evil potions? Never. Perish the thought.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
And don't ever confuse me with Ursula again.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
I've spoken to that... individual.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
I fear that whatever changes he attempts to make will be less than inspiring.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
And I'm sure it's fine if you need something common, such as apples.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Whoever he is, he has an inexcusably sparse stock.
