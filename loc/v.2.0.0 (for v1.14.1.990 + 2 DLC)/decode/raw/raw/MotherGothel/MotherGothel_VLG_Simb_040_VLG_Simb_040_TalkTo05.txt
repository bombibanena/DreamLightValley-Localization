Ah, {PlayerName}, for what pedestrian problem do you need my advice today?

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Simba wants to grow more <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Trees</ActivityItem>, and he remembers you picking <ActivityItem>Fruit</ActivityItem> from them in the past...

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
So I wanted to ask...

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, you've come to the right place. Of course I'll help you.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Why, I just happen to have a book that holds all the answers you're looking for.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
It's something Merlin dropped in the Glade, long ago. And it has notes on the... experiments... you two were so fond of. Here you are â <ActivityItem>Experiments on the Dreamlight Tree, Volume 42.</ActivityItem>

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Thanks for keeping it safe.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What does it say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why didn't you give it back?

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
You're welcome, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
Go make the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Fertilizer</ActivityItem>, and I'll leave the rest of the instructions with your lion friend.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
It's not exactly a scintillating read.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
The important thing to remember is that only someone wielding Dreamlight Magic can bring back the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Trees</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
You'll have to make something called <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Fertilizer</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
In an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem>, mix the <ActivityItem>Fruit</ActivityItem> with some <ActivityItem>Vitalys Crystals</ActivityItem>...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
...<ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Sunlit Plateau Water</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Once it's done, apply it to your Royal Watering Can and then...

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Then?

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Then there's more to do. But I wouldn't want to overwhelm your little head with too many steps.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Because, clearly, that old blowhard can't even be trusted to keep his own books safe. You should be grateful. Also...
