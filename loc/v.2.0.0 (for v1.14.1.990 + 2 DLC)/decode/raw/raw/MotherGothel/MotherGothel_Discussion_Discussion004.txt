{PlayerName}, good. Let's talk through a purely hypothetical situation.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
If you were, say, tracking your wayward daughter through the forest...

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
How would you convince her to come home?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ask her nicely.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Trick her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let her go.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Yes, I'll just ask her politely to stop acting out and sit in her tower like a good girl.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
You've obviously never met a teenager.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Well, of course that's my instinct as well. I'm glad you agree, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Never! Rapunzel belongs with me, and NOTHING will ever change that.
