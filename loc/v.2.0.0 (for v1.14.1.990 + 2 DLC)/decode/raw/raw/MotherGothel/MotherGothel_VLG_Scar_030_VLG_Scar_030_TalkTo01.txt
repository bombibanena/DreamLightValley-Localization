Oh, someone's looking for some motherly advice. How can I help you, dear?

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Actually, Scar and I are trying toâ

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Ugh. Don't tell me you're still associating with that creature.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
My advice is to exile him from the Valley immediately. Do you know that he tried to hunt me down like some sort of prey?

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Before the Forgetting, I was gathering herbs and I felt something following me. Something with... hungry intent.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
He pretended it was all a big mistake, but I knew that was a lie. He was looking for brunch and decided I was it.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
*gasp* HE WAS?!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
You'd be helping me. Not Scar.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
He denied it, of course.

TAG: MotherGothel_027_f
But I could see in his eyes that to him, I was a three-course meal plus dessert.

TAG: MotherGothel_037_f
Look... maybe if there was more room for Scar to roam around, we wouldn't have this kind of problem.

TAG: MotherGothel_035_f
I'm trying to open up the other side of the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: MotherGothel_038_f
There's a wall of wildebeest bones blocking the bridge.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
Oh yes, I believe I have the answer you seek.

TAG: MotherGothel_039_f
Listen closely to a little story... Long ago, there was a young, beautiful, and brilliant woman.

TAG: MotherGothel_042_f
(The woman was me, of course...)

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yeah, I kind of guessed that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
*gasp* I'm shocked!

TAG: MotherGothel_026_f
This young, brilliant, and beautiful woman studied the lions and learned about something called the Circle of Life. For them, there is an order to the world...

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
...and some <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem>. The more ancient and crumbling, the better.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Uh... where am I supposed to find that?

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
Well, there are fossils deep in the mines beneath the Sunlit Plateau. Those should do nicely.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
Those mines are huge. I'll be looking forever.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
Oh, I'll help with that, dear, if you can follow some simple directions.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
When you walk into the mines, <Lore>take a left, walk for a bit, take the first right you see, then take another left.</Lore>

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
Left, right, left. Okay, I think I've got it...

TAG: MotherGothel_034_f
Now, once you have the <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem>, you'll have to <Lore>find a way to turn them into ashes</Lore>...

TAG: MotherGothel_036_f
Scar should know a way to do that. He seems to be rather fond of destruction.

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
Okay. I'll go <Lore>find some Old Bones in the mines, get some Purified Night Shards, and talk to Scar to figure out how to turn it all into a potion...</Lore>

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
And every living creature takes part in it. The lions eat the wildebeests, but when the lions die, they become the very grass the wildebeests eat.

TAG: MotherGothel_025_f
Some would call it poetic.

TAG: MotherGothel_031_f
Well, once I learned of the Circle of Life, I realized there just might be power in it.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
So I perused Merlin's library and found a recipe for a potion.

TAG: MotherGothel_032_f
You must brew the same potion and apply it to your <ActivityItem>Royal Shovel</ActivityItem> to dispatch those bones.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Got it. Find the Ingredients, brew the potion, save the day. But what do I need for the potion?

TAG: MotherGothel_033_f
Oh, just the typical things...

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Some <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem> to give it a spark of magic...
