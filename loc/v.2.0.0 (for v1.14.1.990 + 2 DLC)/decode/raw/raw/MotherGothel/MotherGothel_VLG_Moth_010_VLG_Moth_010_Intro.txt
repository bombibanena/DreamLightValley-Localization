Oh, good. The Valley's gofer's here. Tell me you have time to obtain an artifact for me. I'm in desperate need.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Well this gofer has something else to do...

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
That merchant with the feathers... Stooge, is it? He has a magical scroll. The <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem>. It doesn't lead to riches, so it's completely useless to him.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
It does lead to the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>, though. A magical artifact that will help us restore the Giant Willow in the Glade.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
Plus there's an insignificant little side effect that keeps me forever young... But the important thing is that everyone will benefit.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
I doubt the merchant even knows what the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem> does. So, be a dear and fetch it for me.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Has Mr. McDuck agreed to give it to you?

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Not in so many words. But that can be quickly fixed.

TAG: MotherGothel_027_f
We'll simply spy on him, learn where he hid the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem>, and then take it for my... our... selves.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Spying is fun. Let's do this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
I think I'll just talk to Scrooge directly.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Oh, aren't you scrumptious! Now, go to the food seller â you know, the one in that ridiculous green hat â and warn him someone will steal the <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
He'll believe you and want to help. He'll run to tell the merchant, and I'll be hidden nearby, listening.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
It should be simple enough, even for you.

TAG: MotherGothel_029_f
Let's use a recording device...

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
It'll be easier.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
That way, you'll hear everything perfectly.

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
Better than seeing you in a fedora and trench coat...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Children these days, always relying on gadgets to do their chores.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Lackeys are far more reliable. But fine, {PlayerName}. If you insist, we'll do it your way.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Now, what exactly is a "recording device"?

TAG: MotherGothel_028_f
It's a machine that will let us listen in on conversations. We'll hide it in a plant. We can call it a <ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Nobody will suspect it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
We'll just remove it later.

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
That'll teach Scrooge McDuck not to make me work for free.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Well, it's not like any of these fools have brains enough to be suspicious.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
I'm going to need <ActivityItem>Soil</ActivityItem> and some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
And I'll need to find some <ActivityItem>Electronic Components</ActivityItem> for the mic...

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
Hmm... you might find something in that annoying living box's House.

TAG: MotherGothel_025_f
You know, the one with the obsession for refuse.

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
What are you waiting for? Off you go! Make this "<ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem>" of yours and place it in front of Scrooge's Store.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Covering your tracks? We might just make something of you yet, {PlayerName}...

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
As I told you, the whole Village will benefit from the discovery of the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>. Including you, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
That Goofy does have a tendency to mumble. A dreadful habit...

TAG: MotherGothel_026_f
Now, what exactly is a "recording device"?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
I have no idea what you're saying, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Ugh! I should have known you couldn't do such a simple task.

TAG: MotherGothel_030_f
Fine. Run along then. Maybe Scrooge McDuck will make a deal with you.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
As long as you bring me back the <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem>, I don't care how you do it.

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
What else could someone as dull as you be doing? I'm just teasing, dear. Don't be so serious. Come back soon!
