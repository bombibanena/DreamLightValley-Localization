Finally, someone has managed to open the door to my prison and free me fromâ

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
*gasp!*

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
It's you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Have we met before?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who trapped you in here?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The Dark Magic is gone. You're free!

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Why, you look just like...

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
No, my mistake. It must be your dreadfully ordinary face.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Hah! I'm just teasing. Don't take everything so seriously. I'm very happy to see you.

TAG: Player_004_f
The Ruler locked you up in here?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Why?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
There must be some reason.

TAG: Player_004_choice_003_f
You probably deserved it.

TAG: MotherGothel_031_f
Oh, fine, I'll admit it. I may have been fiddling with a tiny bit of Dark Magic!

TAG: MotherGothel_032_f
I was merely trying to concoct a curse that would keep someone locked away, safe and sound.

TAG: MotherGothel_033_f
After all, why bother with a secret tower when you can just use magic?

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
That's very sensible.

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
That's evil!

TAG: MotherGothel_036_f
Finally, someone who appreciates my genius!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I was just trying to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
This is your fault!

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
How do I fix it?

TAG: MotherGothel_034_f
Now, I'll confess, the spell may have gotten a bit out of hand.

TAG: MotherGothel_039_f
Some might even say it was threatening to destroy the whole Valley. I suppose I don't know my own strength! Ha!

TAG: MotherGothel_035_f
Well, that's when our Ruler decided to turn the spell back on me and lock me away in here.

TAG: MotherGothel_038_f
Now, as much as I appreciate you freeing me, I'm afraid you've made a dreadful mistake.

TAG: MotherGothel_026_f
What do you mean...?

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
You see, just as I was trapped in here by my curse...

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
...the curse was trapped in here with me.

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
Now that you've freed me, <Lore>you've unleashed my Dark Magic on the whole Village</Lore>. Tsk, tsk. What a mess you've made!

TAG: MotherGothel_027_f
I know, darling. It's truly tragic.

TAG: MotherGothel_030_f
But if we can restore the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> to the Pillar of Trust, it just might get rid of all this pesky Dark Magic.

TAG: MotherGothel_040_f
And aren't you lucky? I happen to know where the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> is hidden!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Will you tell me where it is?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Tell me. Now. Before I get mad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I helped you. Now you help me.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Oh, I adore your manners, child.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
Since you're so polite, I'll let you in on my little secret.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
To draw on the Dark Magic I needed to create my curse, I had to rip the <ActivityItem>Orb of Trust</ActivityItem> out of the Pillar.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Come quickly. Let's go to the Pillar of Trust.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Manners, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
You'll soon learn I don't take kindly to rudeness. But just this once, I'll forgive you...

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
It's the Sea Witch who loves to cut a bargain, my dear. Not me.

TAG: MotherGothel_025_f
But since you helped me, I'll let you in on my little secret.

TAG: MotherGothel_028_f
My fault?! You're the one who lifted the curse!

TAG: MotherGothel_029_f
Well, it won't be easy.

TAG: MotherGothel_037_f
Evil? Don't be so melodramatic, dear. Just because I meddle with Dark Magic, that doesn't mean I'm evil!

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Well, you're a feisty one, aren't you?

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Don't you know? Our kind and gracious Ruler, of course. It seems like eons ago now...

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Thank goodness! After our miserable Ruler locked me away in here, I thought I'd never be free of this place.
