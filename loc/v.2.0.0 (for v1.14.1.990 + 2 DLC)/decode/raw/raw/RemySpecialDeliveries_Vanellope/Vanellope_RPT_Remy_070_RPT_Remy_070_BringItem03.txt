Hey, thanks, {PlayerName}! These <ActivityItem>Power-Ups</ActivityItem> are perfect.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What are you going to use them for?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're just a sugary tea drink, though?

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Oh, I need them for the treacherous battle that lies ahead...

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
I'm about to take on the <Lore>final boss of Dreamlight Valley</Lore>!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The Forgetting itself?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
... Me? Am I the final boss?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I give up. Who's the final boss?

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Huh? Oh, you mean all those weird vines and everybody losing their memories and stuff?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Nah. Battling that would be BORING!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
I'm talking about the REAL final boss.

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Why don't you follow me and find out?

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Just stay back so you don't get caught in the battle. Unless you wanna help me; it can be a co-op thing.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
You? No way! You give me lots of gifts and stuff that I don't even have to battle you for.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
I'd say you're more like an end-of-level bonus.

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Don't be ridiculous. You just gave me potions for strength, dexterity, health, durability, and magic!
