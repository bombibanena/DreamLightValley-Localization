Excuse me, Mr. Merlin!!!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Isn't this close enough?

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
CLOSER...!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
What in the world is this magical power of yours that requires me to be so close to experience it?!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
DRAGON BREATH! AHHHHHH!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
Dragon breath? What is dragon breathâ

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Ugh! What a foul smell. Have you eaten an entire field of garlic?!

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
Oh... Um, I'm beginning to realize I've been tricked. There's no magical discovery at all, is there?! Of all the inconsiderate... Why I... Harumph!

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
Smell ya later, Mr. Merlin! Or I guess... smell ME later! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Ah, Vanellope. Why... er... hello.

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Is there something I can help with?

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Yep! I just discovered that I've got a new magic power.

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
A new magic power, you say?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
How fascinating! Is it... technological in nature? Or purely mystical?

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Lean closer and find out!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Hm? Well, all right.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Closer...
