Mother Gothel? I need to talk to you about Rapunzel.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Oh? What is my precious flower up to today? Breaking more rules and shattering my heart?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why do you call her your flower?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I heard you made her sing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Escaping your control once and for all!

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Hmm? Oh, it's just my little pet name for her.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
My fragile, delicate, rebellious little flower...

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Uh-huh... And calling her "flower" has nothing to do with her magic â when she sings for you?

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
I've no idea what you're talking about, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Listen. I'm trying to find a way to harness Rapunzel's magic so she doesn't have to sing for you if she doesn't want to.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
What a brilliant idea. I can't believe I never thought of it. Oh, that's right. I did.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
I've searched for answers for years! You know how much I would love independence...

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
For Rapunzel.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Help me to help you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Let's work together!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'll succeed where you failed.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
I know you're SO busy with... uh... being glamorous.

TAG: MotherGothel_026_f
So very true. It's exhausting being in such high demand. I suppose you could try...

TAG: MotherGothel_028_f
*sigh* Very well... Rapunzel's magic comes from a rare bloom called the Sundrop Flower.

TAG: MotherGothel_029_f
Hmmm... I might be able to find some petals if I use my Hourglass. Where would I look?

TAG: MotherGothel_030_f
Well, since you're feeling so ambitious, take this. It's a <Lore>map</Lore> I made of places the Sundrops grew before they all dried up, petals scattered to the wind.

TAG: MotherGothel_031_f
If you find any â which you won't â take the petals to someone skilled with magic. Perhaps they'll know what to do.

TAG: MotherGothel_032_f
<Lore>Find the Sundrop Petals with the map and Hourglass. Take them to someone magical</Lore>. Got it.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
Why would I waste my precious energy on a task I know is fruitless?

TAG: MotherGothel_025_f
So... let me do it for you?

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
Fail? Don't be ridiculous. And now that I have Rapunzel back, I've no reason to embark on fruitless quests.

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
I think you're afraid that I'll beat you at your own game. You don't want me to figure it out.

TAG: MotherGothel_027_f
Ha! Please. But since it seems you won't go away...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
"Made"? Please! You've seen her running around the Isle! I can't make her do a thing anymore.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
She was happy to volunteer her voice for me.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
She didn't seem happy about it.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Oh, was she a little pouty? Ignore that. You just don't know Rapunzel like I do.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
You're right. You know her best, so... Where does her magic come from?

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
Who knows? It IS magic after all.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
My control? Ha! Oh {PlayerName}, you shouldn't try to make jokes with such a faulty sense of humor.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
I'm her MOTHER. Is it any wonder my daughter loves me after all I've done for her?

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Kind of.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Excuse me?
