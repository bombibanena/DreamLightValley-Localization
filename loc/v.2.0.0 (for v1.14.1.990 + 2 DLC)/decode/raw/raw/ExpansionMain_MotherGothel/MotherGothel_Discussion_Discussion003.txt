Ah. {PlayerName}. Just who I wanted to see. I'm trying to come up with more dangers I can tell Rapunzel about.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
I've done poison ivy, quicksand, bears, spiders, and large spiders.

What other terrifying things can you think of?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You shouldn't scare Rapunzel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Men with pointy teeth.

Hippos.

All I'm trying to do is keep her safe!

Sometimes she has to be a little terrified to be safe. That's just how it is when you have children.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
I actually already have that one. But it's a good one. Points for effort.

Interesting. I've heard about those animals. They're kind of cute, but also extremely dangerous.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
I like it. It will make Rapunzel scared of cute things.
