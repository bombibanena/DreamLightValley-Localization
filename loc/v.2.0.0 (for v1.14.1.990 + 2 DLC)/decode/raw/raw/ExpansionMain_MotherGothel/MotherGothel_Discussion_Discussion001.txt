Ah, {PlayerName}. Tell me: What do you think of my daughter, Rapunzel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm her friend.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She's part of the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She wears her heart on her sleeve.

A "friend." How sweet. Let me make one thing perfectly clear, "friend":

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
...If you hurt a hair on her head I will take you apart piece by piece.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
You have no idea what I've done to protect her. Do we understand each other?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're awful.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
I'm so glad.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Be careful, {PlayerName}. You don't want to upset me. Bad things tend to happen to people who upset me.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Oh, now let's not be churlish, dear. It's very unbecoming.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
I see. How civic-minded of you. The happy leader of a happy little Village of happy, simple people.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Well, let me make one thing perfectly clear...

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
You're not wrong. It seems we share an ability to read people.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Perhaps we might even work together.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
However, let me make one thing perfectly clear...
