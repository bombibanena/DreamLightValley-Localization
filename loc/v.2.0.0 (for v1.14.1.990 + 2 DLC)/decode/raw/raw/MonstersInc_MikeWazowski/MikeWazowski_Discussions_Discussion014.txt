Well, I'm generally a happy guy. But today, I am particularly happy I don't have fur.

Why is that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You mean like Sulley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You'd look cute with fur!

Because every day I get to sleep in for 30 minutes more than Sulley!

He gets out of the shower, and it's at least half an hour with the blow dryer.

Plus, all the shedding! I made him take vacuuming duty the first day we became roommates.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
I swear, he sheds more in a week than I weigh!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Exactly. He finally invested in one of those high-powered blow dryers. Now it only takes 30 minutes after a shower, not an hour.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Ya think so? Hmm...

Well, if Celia said she liked it...
