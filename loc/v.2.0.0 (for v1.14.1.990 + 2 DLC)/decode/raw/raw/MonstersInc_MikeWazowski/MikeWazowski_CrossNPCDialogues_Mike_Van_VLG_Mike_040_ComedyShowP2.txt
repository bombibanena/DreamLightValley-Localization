Keep going! Show me what ya got, old timer.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Really? But I've never even played a cooking simulator.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Ha! Roasting is when one comic ribs another... Gently.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Roast? Ribs? Are you sure you aren't hungry, pal?

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Where's your stomach, anyway, you giant gumball?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Ha-ha! That's it! What do I look like? Tell me another.

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
You look like... a mutant tennis ball?

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Dig a little deeper!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
You look like... a green apple with toothpicks for arms and legs!

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Seriously, how do those freakishly stick-y limbs carry you around?

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
You're about to fall on your face and knock me over like a bowling pin any second!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Okay, whippersnapper. Ahem.

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Ha! Nice, kid! I was right â you're a natural roast comic.

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
I can see why Sulley likes you.

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
Because I'm hilarious and adorable? Guh-doy!

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
I was gonna say because you KINDA remind me of me!

TAG: MikeWazowski_023_f
What? Ha-ha-ha! Now THAT'S hilarious!

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
I think it's about time we wrap this up, don'tcha think?

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
One last joke; you do the honors!

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
Okay... My mother used to say, "beauty's in the eye of the beholder."

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
Since she's mostly eyeball like me, I thought I was the most beautiful monster in history!

TAG: MikeWazowski_028_f
Now I have a girlfriend named Celia. She's cycloptic too.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Back at Monsters, Inc., we used to scare kids for scream energy.

TAG: MikeWazowski_029_f
She always tells me, "I only have eye for you!"

TAG: MikeWazowski_030_f
And I say: "We each only have one eye! Who ELSE could we be looking at?"

TAG: MikeWazowski_031_f
And that's all we've got, Dreamlight Valley!

TAG: MikeWazowski_032_f
WE'VE been great and YOU'VE been an audience!

TAG: MikeWazowski_033_f
See ya in the funny papers!

TAG: MikeWazowski_034_f
That was AMAZING!

TAG: MikeWazowski_035_f
You're a natural, kid! Trust me; this show will be the first of many.

TAG: MikeWazowski_036_f
... Sorry I filled your House with rubber chickens.

TAG: MikeWazowski_037_f
Hey, pranking is a form of comedy too!

TAG: MikeWazowski_038_f
... Just don't ever do that again.

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
And I wanted to be a Scarer ever since the first grade. Talk about BIG dreams!

TAG: MikeWazowski_039_f
Oh, don't worry; I won't... I'll plan something WAY BETTER!

TAG: MikeWazowski_040_f
Oh boy, I've created a monster.

TAG: MikeWazowski_041_f
Actually... I'm kinda proud.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Look at me. The only kids I could scare are the ones afraid of eye contact!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
What was I gonna do? Challenge 'em to a staring contest?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Ha-ha-ha! Not bad for an animated jawbreaker.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Ya know kid, forget rubber chickens.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I think your REAL talent might be roasting.
