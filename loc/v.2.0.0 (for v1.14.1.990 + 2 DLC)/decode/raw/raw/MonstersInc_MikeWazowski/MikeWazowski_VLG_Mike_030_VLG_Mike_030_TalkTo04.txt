So? How does Vanellope like the props?

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
This kid thinks she's got what it takes? Well, I say bring it on!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I like where this is going.

Let's not get too aggressive here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
She loves them!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Great!

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
In fact, she loves them so much, she's excited about being a better comic than you.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
... And not so great.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Can't take a little challenge?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Can't take... {PlayerName}, do you know who you're talking to?

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
I set the all-time laugh record.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I am THE top-performing Jokester in all Monstropolis!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Oh yeah, there's no comedy like comedy performed under pressure.

<ActivityItem>Comedic Meet and Greet Decor</ActivityItem>! It'll set the perfect atmosphere for folks to schmooze and trade jokes.

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
Great, I'll get started!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Okay, I need time to work on my set.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
{PlayerName}, can you get things kicked off for the comedy night?

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
We need a gathering to let everyone get introduced to each other, schmooze for a while, size each other up.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
And give the audience a taste of the comedy they'll enjoy in the full show!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Sure, what will I need?

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Well, luckily, you already have those <ActivityItem>Laugh Canisters</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
If you can find some <ActivityItem>Bricks</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>, that should do the trick.

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
What am I making?

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Right, right... I gotta be funny, not aggressive!
