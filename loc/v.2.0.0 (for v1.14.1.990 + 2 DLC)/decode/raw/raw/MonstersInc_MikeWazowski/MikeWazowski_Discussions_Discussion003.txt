Ya know, back home, we have this GREAT restaurant called Harryhausen's. It's my girlfriend Celia's favorite.

She's a real gourmand. But talk to me about you â you got a favorite kinda food, {PlayerName}?

Fancy food!

I don't think about food much.

I hear that! I could go for a rot dog with some fly fries right about now.

Nothing like the classics, am I right?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Well then, you've got great taste, just like Celia!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Keep it classy, {PlayerName}!
