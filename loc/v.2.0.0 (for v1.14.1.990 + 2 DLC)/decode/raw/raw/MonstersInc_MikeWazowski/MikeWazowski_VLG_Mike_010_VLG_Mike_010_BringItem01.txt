Mike, I brought you some flowers!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
I thought these would look nice â you're not allergic to them, are you?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Oh, that's...

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
It's...?

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
That's ah... ah...

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
ACHOOO!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Bless you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I thought these were supposed to be de-pollened!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Gross, sneeze into your shoulder next time.

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Thanks...

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Oh no...

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Is something wrong?

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
I can't see! My contact lens! I must've sneezed it out!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Oh? Well, it must be around here somewhere.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Actually... I opened the window right before you got here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
We're gonna have to look all over the Valley, aren't we?

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Hey, my sneezes are powerful!

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
But given the direction I was facing... I'm thinkin' it might be on <Lore>Dazzle Beach</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Oh, and when I sneeze, it's also pretty wet. So <Lore>if you see puddles, you're prob'ly on the right track</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Eww... but good to know.

TAG: MikeWazowski_023_f
Oh no, it could be anywhere!

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
They were! Are you tellin' me the pollen here is stronger than Monstropolis pollen?

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Well, Dreamlight Magic works in strange ways...

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
