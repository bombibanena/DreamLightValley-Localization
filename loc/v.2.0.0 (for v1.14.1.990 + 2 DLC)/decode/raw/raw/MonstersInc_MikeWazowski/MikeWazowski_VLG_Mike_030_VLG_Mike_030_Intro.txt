{PlayerName}! You're here! I just had the best idea.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Do you have time to talk about a way to revolutionize the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh, lemme finish up some other stuff first.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
So what's your idea?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Comedy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I like comedy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Is that supposed to be a joke?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What about comedy?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Of course you do. Everybody loves to laugh!

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Dreamlight Valley's first-ever comedy club, here we come!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Great! Where do we start?

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Well, if I'm gonna be the headliner, and I'm definitely gonna be the headliner...

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
I'll need some others to open for me.

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Sure, any ideas?

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
I've got three candidates in mind â <Lore>the Fairy Godmother, WALLÂ·E, and Vanellope</Lore>.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Can I get a little more info?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I'll go talk to them!

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
No offense to the others here, but some of 'em are not that funny.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Oh sure, they're noble, compassionate, brave, blahblahblah...

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
But funny? ... No!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Not to worry; I can fix that!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
I'm listening.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Okay, wow... I feel like I've been preparing for this moment my entire life!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
So, ya know I've been teaching new Jokesters back at Monsters, Inc....

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
But now, I'm gonna bring the laughs here and teach the Villagers how to be comedy experts!

TAG: Player_003_f
What strikes you as comedic about...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
...the Fairy Godmother?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
...WALLÂ·E?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
...Vanellope?

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
I don't know. She just has that twinkle in her eye that makes ya think she's got something hysterical to say but is too polite to say it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
I wanna teach her to stop repressing the chuckles and let 'em fly!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You know, you're right!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm not convinced...

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
Cool! I'll <Lore>go talk to them</Lore> and see if they want to participate.

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
Oh, he's definitely a natural. The physical comedy chops are written all over him!

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
That kid has got her finger on the pulse of today's youth.

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
And she's already mastered the biting zinger!

TAG: MikeWazowski_028_f
Hopefully, they want to participate!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
In itself, no, but the jokes will come!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
We need more of it!
