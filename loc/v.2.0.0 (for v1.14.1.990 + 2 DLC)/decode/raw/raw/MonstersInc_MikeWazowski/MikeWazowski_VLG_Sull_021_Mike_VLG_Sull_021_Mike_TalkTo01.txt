Hey, {PlayerName}! Are you the "amazing assistant" Sulley promised me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I'm here to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Wow, now I need to live up to this expectation.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Amazing. Finally an accurate description of me.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Great! Not that I need it. I'm a shoo-in for Villager of the Month.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
With all my years of training Sulley and lookin' out for him, I know what he appreciates. There's no question that I'm gettin' that title!

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I know exactly how to remind him I'm the clear winner. We're gonna make his favorite <ActivityItem>Hodgepodge Ã  la Monstropolis</ActivityItem> for the whole Village!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
So we're bringing another Monster delicacy to the Valley?

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
You bet we are!

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
I'm almost scared to ask... What's a <ActivityItem>Hodgepodge Ã  la Monstropolis</ActivityItem>?

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Only the best meal ever! It's perfect after a long day of working tirelessly for, let's say... a big energy company.

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
And for it to be great, we need fresh Ingredients...

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
What types of Ingredients?

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Any type. The best thing about <ActivityItem>Hodgepodge Ã  la Monstropolis</ActivityItem> is that it's good with everything. The more diverse, the better.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
I'll get you some fresh Ingredients from around the Valley. Let's say <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Corn</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Bell Peppers</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
What is that?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Aw, don't worry. It's not anything too complicated.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
With all my years of training Sulley and lookin' out for him, I know what he appreciates. There's no question that I'm gettin' that title!

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Yeah, yeah, you're great, {PlayerName}...

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
But so am I! After all my years of training Sulley and being his best friend in the whole world, I know what he appreciates. There's no question that I'm gettin' that title!
