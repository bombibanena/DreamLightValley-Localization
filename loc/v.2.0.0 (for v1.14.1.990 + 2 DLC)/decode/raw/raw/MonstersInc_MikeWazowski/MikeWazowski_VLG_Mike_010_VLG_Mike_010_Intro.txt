Mike! How are you settling into the Valley?

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Oh boy, where do I start?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
At the beginning?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Think it over â I'll be back later.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Okay. Wait... AAA-CHOOO! Sheesh! This place is nuts! *sniff* Is it actually safe? If I leave my House, is the air gonna poison me?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What? No!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Is whimsy and joy toxic to you?

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
You'll be fine, Mike. No poisonous air here. Just relax and come have fun.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Relax?! How am I supposed to relax here?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
No Harryhausen's! No cars! And all this nature! ACHOO! Grr... It's like a different planet!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Is it really that bad?

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
I'm sure you can survive without Harryhausen's for a while. We've got Chez Remy's, after all!

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
I get it; you want fashion goggles. Go for it, pal!

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Just make sure they're industrial strength!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Survive? {PlayerName}, I'm talking about living, here!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Think of this as an extended glamping trip.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Glamping?! I do not "glamp."

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
And even if the air here is fine, YOU are constantly hopping around worlds, right? What if you picked up some sort of interdimensional parasite?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Can't you put on something that'll keep me safe from whatever strange magical germs you might be carrying?

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
If it will get you to calm down and stop being so dramatic, sure!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Great! I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Safety Goggles</ActivityItem>. I'm VERY vulnerable to optical parasites.

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
I can <Lore>talk to Scrooge McDuck and see if he can order something</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
I'm sure you can survive without Harryhausen's for a while. We've got plenty of food!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Oh, funny. I guess my health is a big joke to you.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Okay. Wait... AAA-CHOOO! Sheesh! This place is nuts! *sniff* Is it actually safe? If I stay outside, is the air gonna poison me?
