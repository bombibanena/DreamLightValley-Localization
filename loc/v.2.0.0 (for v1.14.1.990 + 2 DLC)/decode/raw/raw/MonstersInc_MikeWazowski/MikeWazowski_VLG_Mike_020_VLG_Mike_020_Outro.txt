So, how are you feeling about the Valley now?

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
Well, a lotta folks here have some very strange tastes...

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I know it can't be fun when other people don't share your interests...

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
...but at least you got to catch up with your best bud and share a nostalgia-inducing treat!

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
And even if the Villagers don't like the same food as you, they're still super happy that you found your way back here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Aww shucks. You're choking me up here, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
How am I supposed to keep up my air of cool sophistication when you're makin' me misty-eyed?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Right, I forgot that you're a cool city guy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Don't hide from your emotions, Mike!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're right; my apologies.

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
And don't you forget it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_029_f
Oh, and one last thing, {PlayerName}...

TAG: MikeWazowski_030_f
Yes, Mike?

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Even if your taste is questionable...

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
You're still the best.

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
You're right. I gotta appreciate how welcoming everyone is.

TAG: MikeWazowski_028_f
Listen, us city folk have an image to maintain!
