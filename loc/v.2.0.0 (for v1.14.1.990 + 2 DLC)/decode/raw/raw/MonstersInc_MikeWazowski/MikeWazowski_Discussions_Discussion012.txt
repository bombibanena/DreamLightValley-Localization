Yeah, I think my eyesight's getting worse.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh no!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That'll be a big problem for you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Was it already bad?

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Oh, don't worry. I just need to go in and get my eye checked.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Maybe get a new prescription...

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Do you think I could pull off glasses? Err... glass?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You'd look great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You'd look a little funny...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The contact lens is working for you!

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Really? Huh... I gotta think about this.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Thanks, pal!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Funny's perfect! Huh... Ya know, this just opened up a completely new world of comedic possibilities!

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
You're right! Why cover up such a handsome face?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Yeah, since I'm mostly eyeball.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
I probably just need a new prescription.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Nah. I do wear a contact lens. But it's not that bad.
