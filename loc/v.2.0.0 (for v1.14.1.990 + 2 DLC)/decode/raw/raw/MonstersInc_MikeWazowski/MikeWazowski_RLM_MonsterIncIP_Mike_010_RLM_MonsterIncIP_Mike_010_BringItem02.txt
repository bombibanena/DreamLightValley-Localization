A whoopee cushion, huh?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
OH!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
I know exactly how to make this kid laugh!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
A whoopee cushion means this kid MUST be a connoisseur of gassy jokes of all kinds.

I'm gonna burp the biggest burp in the history of burps. That'll DEFINITELY help me smash my last record to smithereens!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Great idea!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Well, I guess it's for the record...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's gross.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Yep, it's gonna make my record unreachable!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Okay, Jokester Assistant. This is the big one â the mother lode! This burp needs bass. It needs power! It needs vibrato!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
I've got two tokens here â I need you to <Lore>bring me one can of soda from each of the three vending machines around reception</Lore>. They'll all add a little something extra to this burp.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Two tokens... but there are three machines?

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Kid, if you wanna be a Jokester, ya gotta <Lore>use the tools you have at your disposal!</Lore> Improvise!

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
<Lore>Get one soda from each machine. Improvise.</Lore> Got it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
You got it! And we got THIS!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
I think you mean, "Great"! That unreachable record is as good as ours!
