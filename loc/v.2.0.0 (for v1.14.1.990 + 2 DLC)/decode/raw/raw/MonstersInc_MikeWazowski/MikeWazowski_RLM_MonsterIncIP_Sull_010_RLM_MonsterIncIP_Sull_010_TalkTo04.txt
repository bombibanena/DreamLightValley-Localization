You... You got me out! You saved me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you okay?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Was it scary in there?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sulley was really worried about you.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Me? I'm great! But, sheesh, am I happy to be back!

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
When I couldn't open the door to the monster world, I KNEW Sulley and you were hard at work trying to get me out.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
I said to myself, "Mike, stay calm!" Then, I used the opportunity to try out some new stand-up material.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Normally, I don't have time to do more than a tight five.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
I'm tellin' ya: That kid was laughing so hard their parents woke up. You got me out JUST in time!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great to have you back, Mr. Wazowski!

Making the best of a bad situation.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
... Can I hear a joke?

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Hey! After all you've done for me? Call me Mike.

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
Ya know what? I'm sweating up a monsoon here. I need some time to center myself before I get back to work.

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Go check in with Sulley while I get back in the zone.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Exactly! You get it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
After all you did for me? Of course!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Why don't slug monsters enter races?

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
... 'Cause they never win, they only ooze.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Hahaha, good one!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Hmm... Not bad.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Does that make kids laugh?

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Thank you! Thank you! I'll be here all week.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Not an easy laugh, huh? I'll think about that one a little more.

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Most of the time. Sometimes I gotta explain that "ooze" rhymes with "lose" but at that point... well, what's the point?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Not even a little!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
If this had been back in the old days when we thought children were toxic? Oof, I don't wanna think about that! But...

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Was he? Aw, that loveable lug.
