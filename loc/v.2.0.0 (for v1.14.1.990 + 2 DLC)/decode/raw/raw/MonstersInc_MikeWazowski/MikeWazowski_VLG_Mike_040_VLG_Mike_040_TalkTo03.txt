Mike... I'm afraid that we've got a problem.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
About that...

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
She won't speak to you directly. You'll have to talk to her manager, Scrooge McDuck.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
She already has a manager?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, I was surprised too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why don't you have a manager?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This is classic Vanellope.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
A problem? Of course we've got a problem! My life is an endless loop of problems!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
*INHALE* *exhale* ... Okay, hit me with it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
It's Vanellope... She doesn't want to open anymore.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
WHAT?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
She wants to be co-headliner with you.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Wow.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
The kid hasn't even done her first show and she wants to go big time, huh?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I gotta go explain to her how this works.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Okay, we need a plan...

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Talk to her manager... All right, if she wants to play that game...

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
I'll get Sulley to be MY manager!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
And you... you can be my agent.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Cool!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How much do I get paid?

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
So what's next?

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Go put on somethin' spiffy enough to look like a real agent.

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
Somethin' <Lore>professional</Lore>, <Lore>elegant</Lore>, or <Lore>modern</Lore> should do the trick.

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
And then, we'll have a business meeting.

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
Talk to her manager... Fine! Her people can talk to my people!

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
Ha! Good one, {PlayerName}. Maybe we should have you replace Vanellope.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Good question.
