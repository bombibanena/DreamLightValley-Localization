All right, perfect! We got doors! Let me have a look at the files that came with those keycards.

TAG: MikeWazowski_000_f
You know... the files with information on how to make the kid behind each one of these doors laugh themselves silly?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
There were no files with these cards...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh no, did I lose them?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yeah... Files... About that...

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
No files?! How am I supposed to work without intel?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
No files, no laughs, no breaking records â Sulley's vacation will be ruined!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Slooooow down, Mike.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
There has to be some way...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He could go without you.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
I am your Jokester Assistant, and we will figure out a way to do this!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Hm... Why don't I make NEW files?

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
New files? NEW FILES? That's preposterous! That's absurd!

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
... Make new files how?

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
I'll sneak into the kids' rooms while they're still empty... and see if I can <Lore>find clues</Lore> about what would make each one laugh.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Really? That's... genius! I knew you'd be a great Jokester Assistant.

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Don't worry, Mike. I'm on the case. I'll <Lore>search for clues in each of the rooms</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Perfect! Let's head to door F2 first!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Maybe... maybe... we could... Oh, I don't know! This isn't my department! I tell jokes, I don't do RESEARCH!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
What? No, that's impossible. Trust me. Sulley and I are a package deal.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Nah, it's probably not you. I'm tellin' ya, this place is a paperwork disaster!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
... There are none, are there? Ugh! This place is a paperwork disaster!
