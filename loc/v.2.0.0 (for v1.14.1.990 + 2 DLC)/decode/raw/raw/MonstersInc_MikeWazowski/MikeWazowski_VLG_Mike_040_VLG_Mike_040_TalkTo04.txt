Well, that...

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
We got steamrolled!

That Scrooge McDuck is one crafty negotiator. Think I should fire Sulley and hire McDuck out from under Vanellope?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds kinda mean.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't think Scrooge is getting paid, so go for it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Mean? Nah! It's just the comedy business.

Try to <Lore>find Vanellope's posters and stick my face on 'em</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Can do!

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Great! I'll work on my set. Got a few final polishes to put on it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
So what's the plan?

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Well, they're already putting up posters...

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Okay, two can play at that game!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Oh, are we going to make some posters too?

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
No need. They've already done the work for us!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
We're just gonna add my handsome face to their posters.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Here, take these.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Interesting. I'll keep that in mind...
