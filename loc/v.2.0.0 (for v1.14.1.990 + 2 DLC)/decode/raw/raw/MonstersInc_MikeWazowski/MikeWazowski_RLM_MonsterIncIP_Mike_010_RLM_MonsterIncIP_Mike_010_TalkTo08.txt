Don't say a word. I heard everything you said to Sulley. You're a human?!<lw>I... uh... I gotta admit, I freaked out a little at first, but now that I've had some time to think about it...

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
You're a human with an opportunity for a vacation to someplace called "Dreamlight Valley"! And boy, do I need a vacation! There's just one problem â I can't leave. Yet.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
You know I already set the All-Time Laugh Record...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yes, so... what's the problem?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Hm, no. You never mentioned that.

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
If I take a vacation, some other monster could break my record while I'm on the beach pretending to read a book but really asleep!

TAG: MikeWazowski_000_f
I can't let that happen. I've gotta set a Jokester record nobody can ever beat!

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
You understand, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's set a record!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We can make that happen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How will we know when it's high enough?

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
That's the spirit!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
As Senior Co-President of Monsters, Incorporated and Chief Executive Vice-Deputy Administrative Director of Comedy Resources Management, I hereby officially promote you from intern to Jokester Assistant!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
First order of business: We need DOORS, which means we need keycards!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Keycards?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I can't believe I got promoted!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'll be running this place soon!

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Okay, write this down:

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Keycards tell the system which doors to the human world to bring us. Once you find a couple of those, we're in business!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Currently, all the <ActivityItem>Keycards<ActivityItem> are at <Lore>Reception</Lore>. So, start there.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Just one problem... We don't have a receptionist today, and that door is jammed up. So you might have to <Lore>find something to jimmy it open</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
<Lore>Jimmy the jammed door</Lore>! Okay!

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
Hey, nice rhythm!

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Believe it! You're gonna join me at the top!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
I like that ambition!

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I like your attitude!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Good question... that I do not have an answer for.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
But I will!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
All right, all right. I deserve the sarcasm. My point is...
