My contact lens! You found it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Hope it's not scratched up or anything.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
This thing? It's built like a tank! When you've got one eye as big as mine, you need heavy-duty contacts.

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Plus, it's covered by insurance. Monsters, Inc. has excellent benefits.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Well, if it is scratched, do we need to fill out an incident report?

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Inform the insurance company? Start the paperwork?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Pa-paperwork? Did you say, "p-p-paperwork"? Oh boy, I gotta sit down.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is paperwork really that bad?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh come on, Mike, lighten up!

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
You can only say that if you've never worked at Monsters, Inc.!

TAG: MikeWazowski_028_f
Noted.

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
I could keep goin'! Do you have all day?

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
As much as I'd love to hear everything about them that bothers you, I actually don't have all day.

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
But I've got an idea! What if I dress up like Roz and then you can let out everything you've clearly wanted to say to her.

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
Huh. That could be interesting. Well, I'm game if you are!

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
She always wears these <ActivityItem>horn-rimmed glasses and a red sweater</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
Hmm, I've got something else in mind that will <Lore>help me look like Roz</Lore> too...

TAG: MikeWazowski_023_f
You try and center yourself for a moment; I'll be back to help you open up.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Wait... What are you up to?

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Making something that I think will be a big help! I'll be putting together some <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Rope</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
I thought... I thought I'd get a break from Roz and her twin sister Roze here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
Well, this I gotta see.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
You will!

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
What is happening? I'm actually shaking now.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
And... ACHOO! My allergies are acting up again!

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
Hmm, I wonder if there's a link between your allergies and stress...

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Have you tried figuring out why Roz and Roze get under your skin like that?

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
You mean aside from how they say, "Wazzzooowwwskiiii" every morning when I get to work?

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
Or their constant demands for paperwork?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
You don't understand! The paperwork!
