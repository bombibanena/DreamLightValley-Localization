Minnie â are you okay? Did Jack Skellington give you a horrible gift?

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Oh, no. Jack had the most wonderful gift for me!

TAG: Minnie_008_f
He... did?

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Yes. I came back to my House to find a mysterious letter saying "Happy Dreamlight Day"... and then everything went dark!

TAG: Minnie_010_f
When I reached around to find the light switch, I put my hands into something that could only have been cold and slimy guts!

TAG: Minnie_011_f
No!

TAG: Minnie_012_f
Yes!

TAG: Minnie_013_f
I kept looking, but the next thing I knew, my hands were full of what felt like eyeballs!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This sounds horrifying?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That Jack has questions to answer...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hmmm, that sounds familiar.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
It was! I absolutely loved it!

TAG: Minnie_027_f
Yeah. Maybe if we can convince him that Oogie Boogie has come to the Valley, too... that might frighten Jack?

TAG: Minnie_028_f
Let's try it! I've already made some <ActivityItem>Oogie Boogie Fan Club Signs</ActivityItem> and an <ActivityItem>Oogie Boogie Shirt</ActivityItem>! Maybe you could use them to trick Jack.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
If you put a sign in <Lore>each Biome</Lore>, then Jack is sure to see them!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Thanks, Minnie!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Please don't try to scare me in the future!

TAG: Minnie_018_f
When the lights came back on, there was a plate of cold spaghetti and a bowl of peeled grapes right in front of me!

TAG: Minnie_019_f
Oh, so Jack gifted you a classic haunted house experience?

TAG: Minnie_020_f
He did. And it was so much fun!

TAG: Minnie_021_f
I wonder, though... Jack spends so much time thinking of ways to scare other people, but when has anyone taken the time to scare him?

TAG: Minnie_022_f
That's a great question, Minnie. How about we take the initiative and go for it?

TAG: Minnie_023_f
That's just what I was thinking, and I have an idea.

TAG: Minnie_024_f
You do? What could scare someone like the Pumpkin King himself?

TAG: Minnie_025_f
Well, he mentioned that he used to have a nemesis. What if we use the idea of Oogie Boogie?

TAG: Minnie_029_f
You're very welcome.

TAG: Minnie_000_f
Oh, and if you really want to give him a fright, try using the Touch of Magic tool with this <Lore>Oogie Boogie Motif</Lore>!

TAG: Minnie_030_f
I'll only do it if you ask to be scared first. I promise.

TAG: Minnie_015_f
Oh, please don't be angry at him!

TAG: Minnie_016_f
Did the guts and eyeballs... smell like food?

TAG: Minnie_017_f
They did!
