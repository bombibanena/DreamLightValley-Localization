Hey Minnie, got a moment for a little poll?

TAG: Minnie_014_f
I'm talking to a bunch of Villagers on behalf of Jack Skellington.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Of course, {PlayerName}. What would Jack like to know?

TAG: Minnie_003_f
What's your favorite holiday and why?

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Well, I adore different things about all the holidays. But if I had to say the one that's the most fun, it would be Halloween!

TAG: Minnie_005_f
I just LOVE dressing up... and being scared!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's kinda surprising, to be honest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Me too!

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Really, why? I love experimenting with fashion.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
I'm glad I could help. Goodbye, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Minnie_000_f
Though I do like being fun-scared, not real-scared.

TAG: Minnie_015_f
When I was trapped in the Here and There, that was really scary and not fun at all.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
What do you like about being fun-scared?

TAG: Minnie_009_f
It's just so exciting!

TAG: Minnie_010_f
It's like a marvelous surprise, and when it's over you remember that you're safe and surrounded by your friends.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Aww, Minnie, that's really sweet.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
Jack Skellington will be happy to hear it! Talk to you later.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Oh, I bet you've had some wonderful costumes!
