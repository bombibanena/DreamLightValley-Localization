That... that was amazing.

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
Everybody just accepted me for who I was. I thought they'd be mad... I thought they'd hate me...

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
I guess kindness, love, care... It's like they're always waiting here for me, aren't they?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
As long as you're willing to give as much as you get.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
As long as you're willing to ask for it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Always. No questions asked.

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
... Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
This is... This is a LOT. I hope you don't mind if I spend some time alone for a while, just... to process.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Take as much time as you need.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Don't take too long. We've got a lot of catching up to do.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Don't worry. I don't think I need too much time. But... I appreciate you giving me the space.

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
I couldn't believe how much kindness everybody showed me, even after everything I did.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
I feel a lot better already. Promise to <Lore>keep visiting me in the Dark Castle</Lore> until I'm ready to explore the Village?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You couldn't get rid of me if you tried.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sure, but you have to be okay being alone sometimes too.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
We've got too much catching up to do.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
That sounds... kind of great.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
Oh! Hey! Before you go...

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
...I've got something for you. The <ActivityItem>Orb of Remembrance</ActivityItem>.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Maybe now you can <Lore>put it back in the Pillar</Lore>.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
I know you spent a lot of time alone before. But I think you need to learn to see that being alone doesn't need to be misery.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Sometimes it can be kind of nice!

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Yeah. It's not so bad being alone when you don't FEEL all alone.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Don't worry. I think I'll be ready to come explore the Village with you pretty soon.
