I remember now. This bookshelf, it used to be covered in our favorite stories.

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
We'd spend hours reading them together...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Stories let us be whatever we wanted.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Stories let us explore from the safety of our room.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Stories were our safe place.

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
Even when we were just a little kid in a big world... stories let us feel powerful. They let us be whoever we wanted.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
I... I wish it could be like that again.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It can be. Trust me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe it can't be. And maybe that's okay.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Growing up doesn't have to mean leaving the things that are important to us behind.

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
You can hang on to what you love.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
But... what would you hang on to?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Joy and enthusiasm.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Excitement and exploration.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Creativity and play.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
When you're a little kid, you're not so afraid of stuff yet. All you know is joy and excitement about everything you find.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Come with me. All of those things are waiting for us back in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
After everything I've done... it's not too late?

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
It's never too late.

TAG: TheForgotten_022_f
The spell I started... I don't know if I can stop it on my own.

TAG: TheForgotten_023_f
Then we'll stop it together. Come on.

TAG: TheForgotten_000_f
I never want to lose that feeling. No matter how old I get.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
... Me neither. I guess there's still more of a connection between us than I thought.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
That and... I can't get what Merlin told me out of my head all of a sudden... Love, kindness, acts of care. You need those too, don't you...?

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
Now you're getting it. And the stories we loved as kids... They hold all of these things.

TAG: TheForgotten_025_f
Of course. So as long as we remember those stories... the things we loved about being kids... they'll never be...

TAG: TheForgotten_026_f
They'll never be...

TAG: TheForgotten_027_f
...forgotten?

TAG: TheForgotten_028_f
Exactly.

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Remember those days? Everything seemed like an adventure. Everything was new.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
When you're a kid, you haven't figured out how the world works yet. So there are no limits on what you can do.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Things won't ever be quite like they were when we were kids. But that doesn't mean leaving EVERYTHING behind.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
You can hang on to what's important to you.

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
Even when we weren't allowed to bike past the stop sign at the end of the street... stories let us see to the other side of the universe.

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
No matter how bad the world got... stories were somewhere safe.
