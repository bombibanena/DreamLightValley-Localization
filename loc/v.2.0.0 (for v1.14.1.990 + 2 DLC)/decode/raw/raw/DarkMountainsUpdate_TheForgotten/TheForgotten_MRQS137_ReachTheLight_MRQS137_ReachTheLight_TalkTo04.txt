This desk... I don't remember anything about it.

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
I think I do. This was where I used to do my homework.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Homework was never my favorite thing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I got so intense about it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I had no time for anything else.

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
Ugh. Me too. I remember wishing I could go play instead.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
It was like we were being pulled apart. I wanted to play, but you wanted to work.

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
There must be something else here though. Something from before all that...

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
I remember that. It felt like you and I were being torn apart. I wanted to play, but you wanted to work.

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
That sounds right. It was like part of me disappeared.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
The part of me that was... you. I wanted to play, but you wanted to work.
