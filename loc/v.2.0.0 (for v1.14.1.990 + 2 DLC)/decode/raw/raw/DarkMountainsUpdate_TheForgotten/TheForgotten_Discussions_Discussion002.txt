Do you think any of the Villagers are still mad at me because of the whole... almost destroying the universe thing?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
No way!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
They'll forgive you in time.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You just have to show that you're really sorry.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
Everyone in Dreamlight Valley knows that you didn't mean to do that. Trust me.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
You're sure...?

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
You made mistakes... and that's okay. Everyone messes up sometimes.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Really...?

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Sure. It doesn't always feel good to mess up, but it's the best way to learn.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Learn what...? How to mess up even more?

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
How to do better next time. If we were always perfect, we could never grow.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Huh... that's true... I guess...

TAG: Player_003_exit_000_f
Gotta go!

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
Some of the Villagers might still be a little on edge. But they'll come around.

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
The more you visit the Village, the more everyone will see that you didn't mean to hurt anyone.
