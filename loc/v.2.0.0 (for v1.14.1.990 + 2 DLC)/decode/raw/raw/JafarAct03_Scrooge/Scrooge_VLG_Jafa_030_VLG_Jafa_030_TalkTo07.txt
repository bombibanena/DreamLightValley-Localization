Hey Mr. McDuck, how are you feeling today?

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Oswald is sick and Rapunzel is... off.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
<i>Is it so strange for my accent to have diminished?</i>

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
When you put it that way, I guess not.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
But all at once? Overnight?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
<i>Good day to you, {PlayerName}!</i>

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
<i>I am quite well.</i>

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Umm, there's something different about you...

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
<i>A new twinkle in my eye, perhaps? A new spring in my step?</i>

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
No... it's not that.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
What happened to your accent?

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
<i>Is it not natural for one's mode of speech to gradually shift?</i>

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
<i>I have been in Dreamlight Valley for quite some time now, and it has been ages since I visited my homeland.</i>

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
<i>You see? All is well!</i>

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
Hmm, not so sure about that...

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
<i>Why, you are as paranoid as that EVE creature!</i>

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
EVE? What about her? Why is she paranoid?

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
<i>She has been highly disagreeable today. I would suggest avoiding her. She clearly wants to be left alone.</i>

TAG: Scrooge_020_f
... Weird.

TAG: Scrooge_021_f
All right, thanks Mr. McDuck. I'll see you around.

TAG: Scrooge_022_f
<i>Goodbye!</i>

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
<i>Did it change overnight? Or did you simply not notice the shift?</i>

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Oswald is sick and Gaston is... surprisingly wordy.
