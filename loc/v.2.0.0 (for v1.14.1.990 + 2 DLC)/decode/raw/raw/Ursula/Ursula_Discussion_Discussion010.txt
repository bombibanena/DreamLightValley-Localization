I think I'll brew some potions today. Mustn't let my stocks get too depleted.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What kinds of potions?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How do you do that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
... Evil potions?

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Magical ink. Oh, and moisturizer. Can't run out of that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What do you use magical ink for?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why do you need moisturizer? You live underwater.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Can I have some?

TAG: Ursula_006_f
My contracts, of course.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
The ink needs to be mystically binding and waterproof.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Oh, darling. There's a difference between my skin being moisturized and simply having moisture on it.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
No, that wouldn't be wise, dearie. The ingredients I use are safe for seafolk.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
But they might be poisonous to humans.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
And even if they weren't... you can't get something for nothing, you know.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Oh, I'll never share my secret recipes, {PlayerName}. That would be telling.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Hmm... now, what to make today?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Ha! Always so suspicious.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Don't worry, angelfish. What I make today will only be for me. Hmm... now, what do I need...
