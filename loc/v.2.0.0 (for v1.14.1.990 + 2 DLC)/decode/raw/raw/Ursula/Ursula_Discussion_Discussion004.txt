Oh, those tired old things. I've made a million of them. Though I suppose I could make one that's designed just for the Villagers here. They're not all merfolk, after all.

That's called makeup, angelfish. Though I suppose I could add a little magic to some.

Luck spells are tricky, but they do sell well. Not a bad idea.
