My my, angelfish? What's all this?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
You might have noticed some weird magical stuff going on around here...

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Nala and I found these mystical rifts that opened up in the water. And then that fish swam out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Have you ever seen anything like it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We figured you would be the best person to ask.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We thought it might be one of your relatives.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
It doesn't look like any fish I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Let me take a closer look.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Gah! The fish disappeared right out of my hands.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
But I got enough of a look at it to tell you where it's from.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
And since I'm so generous... perhaps I'll even tell you without asking for anything in trade.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'd trade you my gratitude.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'd really appreciate that.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Out with it, Ursula.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Hardly as valuable as what I'm about to tell you. But that's fine. You'll be in my debt.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
This fish comes from <Lore>the Here and There</Lore>.

TAG: Ursula_021_f
I went to the Here and There to get the Orb of Trust back, but I didn't see any fish like this.

TAG: Ursula_029_f
Poor Nala. She was supposed to be the protector of this Valley, but now she might lead it to its destruction...

TAG: Ursula_000_f
... All because of one clumsy little mistake.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
It's not Nala's fault.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
She shouldn't have meddled in this.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Stop gloating and help us fix this.

TAG: Ursula_023_f
You may have visited, but you merely went as deep as sea-foam skimming the ocean surface.

TAG: Ursula_024_f
This fish came from somewhere much deeper in the Here and There than that...

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Like where Minnie went when she disappeared?

TAG: Ursula_022_f
Ah-ha! Now you're getting it.

TAG: Ursula_025_f
It seems you and Nala have done something to rip open the walls between... well... between the Here and There!

TAG: Ursula_026_f
What about those <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> I showed you?

TAG: Ursula_027_f
If I'm not mistaken, this has happened before. Long ago. Those statues must have been part of some enchantment to seal the rifts.

TAG: Ursula_028_f
But now that you've disturbed them... the enchantment is broken.

TAG: Ursula_030_f
No, of course not. This magic isn't something a lion should be meddling in.

TAG: Ursula_032_f
At least you're wise enough to know to come to me.

TAG: Ursula_034_f
Now, if we don't fix this soon, who knows what else might leak into the Village?

TAG: Ursula_035_f
I'll need some time to figure out how to shut them for good.

TAG: Ursula_036_f
I'm afraid that in these matters, time is the one thing that can't be bargained for.

TAG: Ursula_031_f
Certainly not. Magic like this is no business for a lion.

TAG: Ursula_033_f
I'm not running a charity here, {PlayerName}. Let me have a little fun.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Just remember: You're in my debt, angelfish.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Manners, angelfish. Or I'll keep this valuable information to myself.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
*sigh* Fine. Please tell me.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
Much better. And remember: Now you're in my debt.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
You thought right, dearie. With magic like this, you should always talk to me, not that windbag wizard.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Now, let me take a closer look at this odd creature you've found...

TAG: Ursula_008_f
My relatives?! How dare you?! I ought to turn you into a barnacle for an insult like that.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
You're lucky I'm just as curious as you about what this fish might be.
