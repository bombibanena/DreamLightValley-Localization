Time to...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Hold up your end of the bargain.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Free Prince Eric.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Undo your magic spell.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Yes, of course... As promised, angelfish, your very own... pathetic... Prince Eric.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He's still an unfortunate soul!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How do I transform him back?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's not what we agreed to!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Oh, it's up to you to figure out how to fix that. Always read the fine print, dearie.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
But since I'm in a good mood, I'll give you a gift. Take this outfit. And don't worry your pretty little head about my growing power. I promise to put it to good use.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
And since I'm in a good mood, here's an outfit as a gift for all your hard work... and to make sure you keep your nose out of my business.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
And since I see a bit of me in you... here's a gift. It'll remind you of me. Isn't that fabulous?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Oh, it's up to you to figure out how to fix that. Always read the fine print, dearie.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Isn't it? I offered to TRADE Eric... and I have!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
It's up to you to figure out how to re-prince-ify him!

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Yes, of course... As promised, angelfish, your very own... pathetic... Prince Eric.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Who said anything about transforming him back? All I promised, angelfish, was that Prince Eric would be yours.
