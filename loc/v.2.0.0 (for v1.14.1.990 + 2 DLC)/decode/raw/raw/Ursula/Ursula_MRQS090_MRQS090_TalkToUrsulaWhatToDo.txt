How typical. Once again, a bearded old geezer leaves all the dirty work to yours truly... and to you, apparently.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Tell me, {PlayerName}... are you ready to do whatever it takes?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Anything for Dreamlight Valley!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Gulp. I hope so.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There's a limit to my sacrifice.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Ha! We'll see about that!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Now dearie, some of us managed to break free of the Dark Magic running rampant in the Village. But we'll need to give something up to free the others.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Merlin gave me his trust. Given our history, that was probably enough of a sacrifice.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
As for me, I'm sacrificing my pride for the greater good. Marvelously noble of me, isn't it?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
That leaves Kristoff. He fought off the curse before it could lock him up. It's up to you to get something from him. The greatest sacrifice of all.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
<Lore>His love.</Lore>

TAG: Ursula_008_f
He must be willing to give up all his memories of his love â Anna â to save the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
That's awful! I can't!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
That's all? Easy.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
YOU HAVE TO! It's the only hope to save your friends.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
And we'll need a few Ingredients to complete the spell. Make sure you bring back a few <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Night Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
When you have all that, come to <Lore>the cave where we first met</Lore>. I'll do my magic on the spell there.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Good. Because it's the only hope of saving your friends.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Hope? Bah! Hope's for idealistic fools. If you're going to help, you'd best be made of stronger stuff.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Then I suppose we'll see where your limits lie...
