Ah! Just the guinea pig I need. You'll help me with a little magical experimentation, won't you?

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Just a trifling thing, really. I doubt ANYONE will get hurt.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
It's a little power-extraction spell, using that Flower you acquired. What do you say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Wait. You DOUBT anyone will get hurt?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
If you say it's safe, I trust you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A dangerous ritual? Fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Sorry, it'll have to wait!

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Oh, don't be so dramatic, dearie!

TAG: Ursula_004_f
We'll set up for the spell, and I'll make SURE it's safe. Promise!

TAG: Ursula_011_f
First we need a seashell. But not just ANY seashell... We need one from that girl who's always talking to the ocean, Moana.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Once you have that, find some <ActivityItem>Aquamarine</ActivityItem> and some <ActivityItem>Squid</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Then combine all those things together into an enchantment Potion and bring it to me!

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Ooo, you're so sweet, I could eat you up!

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Careful, dear. The danger shouldn't be the exciting part.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
All right, let's prepare for a spell... and don't forget who's the boss!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Don't stay away too long. You don't want to get left out in the cold.
