Say, Ursula, there's something I've been wondering about.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
How do you get around the Village so fast?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Sometimes I'll see you swimming in the ocean... and then a minute later you're in a pond in the Meadow.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's impressive.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's confusing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's freaking me out!

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Oh dearie, there's an entire world beneath this Village that you know nothing of.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
There are countless secret waterways and passages that let me be anywhere I want.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
... And keep an eye on anyone I want.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
You might rule the Village above the surface, but in the waterways, I'm the one with all the power.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm fine with sharing!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You want power? Be ready for responsibility.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You better not try anything, Ursula. I'm watching you.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I don't mind if everyone plays a role in taking care of this Village, above or below.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Can you possibly be so naÃ¯ve? No one's ever satisfied with just a little power.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Sooner or later... you and I are going to have to make some deals, angelfish.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
If there's a world beneath this Village, you better be ready to take care of it, just like I take care of the Valley above.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Responsibility? You sound like that windbag, Merlin.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
If power were nothing but a chore, then there wouldn't be so many trying to get it.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Don't be afraid to have a little fun, angelfish.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Dreamlight Valley is a place where we can all get along together in peace. Don't ruin that.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Is that a threat, angelfish?

TAG: Ursula_016_f
... I love it! You're finally learning.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
Don't worry. I have no interest in taking over your precious Valley...

TAG: Ursula_018_f
...yet.
