Ursula, we need your help. We've got these <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem>, but we don't know what we need to do next...

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Well, it's about time you came to see me, dearie.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I've had about enough of these pesky fish and all this mystical nonsense clogging up the Village waterways.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
But luckily for you... I've figured out exactly how to set things right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Really? How?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Oh, thank you, Ursula!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Then stop complaining and tell me.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
It's simple enough.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Now, listen closely, {PlayerName}. I don't want to have to repeat myself.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
To make new <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem>, you'll need to find <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Sand</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Then to focus the magic, each statue will need a gemstone embedded in its forehead. A gemstone from the place where each rift opened.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
The rifts opened on Dazzle Beach, in the Glade of Trust, and in the Frosted Heights...

TAG: Ursula_005_f
An <ActivityItem>Aquamarine</ActivityItem>, an <ActivityItem>Amethyst</ActivityItem> and a <ActivityItem>Citrine</ActivityItem> ought to do, then.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Finally, you'll need to <ActivityItem>craft the Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> and place them near each rift to ensure it closes.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Best of luck, angelfish. I hope it's not too much for you.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Finally! Some appreciation for all I do around here.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Complaining?! Hardly. If I told you all of my complaints about this place, we'd be here all month.
