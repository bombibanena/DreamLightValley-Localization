Angelfish, it's you! Did you find anything in the ruins?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A <ActivityItem>Dark Crystal</ActivityItem> on a pedestal.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Nothing except this rock.

TAG: Ursula_000_f
Fabulous! Power, magic, it's exactly what I wanted!

TAG: Ursula_003_f
There were four pedestals in the ruins... and when I picked this up, they all started to glow!

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Four pedestals in the ruins, eh? Well then, the other <ActivityItem>Crystals</ActivityItem> must've been scattered throughout the Village after the Forgetting.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
The glow on the pedestal must be the ruins calling out for the <ActivityItem>Crystals</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Oh, and I see that you already found the other three! Bring them all back to their corresponding pedestals and see what happens.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Don't forget this one, dearie. You're gonna need it.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Look around the Village, {PlayerName}! Bring those <ActivityItem>Crystals</ActivityItem> back to their pedestals and see what happens.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Oh, and take this one with you. You're gonna need it.
