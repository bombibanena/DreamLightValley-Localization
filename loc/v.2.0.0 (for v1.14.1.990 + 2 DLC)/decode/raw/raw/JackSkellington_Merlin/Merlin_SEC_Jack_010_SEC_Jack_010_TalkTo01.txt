Hey, Merlin... I was wondering if you've noticed anything strange going on around the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Will do â thanks, Merlin!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
I most certainly have!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
The magical instruments in the Library have been acting quite irregularly!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
They've registered an influx of magic in the Valley â magic that hasn't been felt here in quite some time.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Do you think it could have anything to do with this <ActivityItem>Matryoshka Doll</ActivityItem> I found?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Hmm... I suppose it's possible. Perhaps someone new is trying to come through into the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
They may be having trouble fully manifesting. I highly recommend you investigate all anomalies.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
In fact, have you <Lore>surveyed the Forgotten Lands</Lore> recently? My instruments indicated a disturbance there.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Perhaps those odd dolls have something to do with it.
