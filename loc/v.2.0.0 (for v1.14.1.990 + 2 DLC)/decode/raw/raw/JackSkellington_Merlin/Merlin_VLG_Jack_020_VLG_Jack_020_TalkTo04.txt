Merlin, I could use some help â it's a bit of an emergency.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
An emergency? Goodness, what's the trouble now?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Well, I was helping Jack Skellington with his dreams of scientific discovery...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
And something went dreadfully wrong? Ahh, I've certainly been in that position.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I knew you'd understand.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Amazing. You're a lifesaver.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Aren't you a wizard, not a scientist?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Far too well.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Now which one was it...? Was it green? No... no... it must have been purple.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Okay, purple potion. Got it.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Or was the purple the exact one to avoid in this situation? I'm sure it's in my notes...

TAG: Merlin_016_f
I do know that you're looking for the <Lore>Night Thorn's perfect opposite</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
I've a <Lore>Green Formula</Lore>, a <Lore>Blue Formula</Lore>, a <Lore>Yellow Formula</Lore>, and a <Lore>Purple Formula</Lore>. But which is the right one...?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Now, tell me what went wrong.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
So Jack Skellington was curious about Night Shards, and well...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
...somehow he made a Giant Night Thorn plant.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Hmm... I suppose I should be disapproving, but... I can't say that I haven't been in the same pickle.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
... Really?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Oh yes! I did my share of experiments before you returned to the Valley and... well, not all of them were successful.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Luckily, I have just the formula for this. A sort of potion, as it were. It turns out that complementary metaphysics are the key!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
You're the best, Merlin.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Just look around my library â you'll find it easily enough.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Merlin, look at this place â it's a mess!

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Nonsense! Everything is exactly where it's meant to be! You simply don't understand my filing system.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Must be a wizard thing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Clearly not.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I have my doubts about there being a filing system at all.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Precisely!

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Now, I've other business to attend to. Good luck, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Well, I'll leave the administration of the Valley to you, and you leave the organization of my home to me.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Happens to all wizards â people attribute to you what you haven't done, and dismiss what you have!

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Oh well, it'll be easy enough to find once you enter my library.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Merlin, I've seen what it's like in your House â the place is a mess!

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Oh, hem, well, let's see what I can do before you go on thanking me.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
Yes, yes. But a thoughtful wizard is a scientist who uses magic for their research!
