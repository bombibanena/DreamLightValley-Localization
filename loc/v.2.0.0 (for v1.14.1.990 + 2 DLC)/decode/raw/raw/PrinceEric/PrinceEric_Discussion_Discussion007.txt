Settle a question for me, {PlayerName}.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
I love sailing big ships. Galleons, with a crew and three masts.

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
But Moana says there's nothing like skimming the waves in a small canoe.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
Which do you prefer? A big ship or a small canoe?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Big ships.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Small canoes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It depends.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
That's how I feel. I like a solid deck under my feet.

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
And bigger ships means you can haul more, and carry more people.

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
But maybe I'm just more comfortable with large ships because they're what I'm used to.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
Yeah? Well, they are useful. I can't deny that. Light and fast.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
Moana offered to teach me how to sail one. Maybe I should take her up on it.

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
I guess you're right. Different kinds of boats work for different things.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
My kingdom needs large ships to carry trade cargo.

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
But Moana's canoe is perfect for navigating between smaller islands.

TAG: PrinceEric_012_f
We're lucky we have both options.
