{PlayerName}, I really want to do something nice for Ariel. So I thought I should take her on a picnic.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
Just the two of us. Where do you think we should go?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Dazzle Beach!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The Forest of Valor!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The Frosted Heights!

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
That's a great idea! A blanket, some nice food...

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
Watching the waves and the horizon.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
Well, the location's decided. What should I bring along to enjoy with our main course?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Fruit.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Freshly baked bread.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Chocolate chip cookies.

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
Sounds good! I'll gather some different fruit and maybe visit Goofy's Stall.

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
Ariel will love it.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
She gets almost as excited about surface food as she does about human objects.

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
Yeah! Merfolk can't exactly mill flour underwater.

TAG: PrinceEric_012_f
So I bet Ariel hasn't tried many different kinds of bread.

TAG: PrinceEric_013_f
I'll ask Remy if he has any good ideas.

TAG: PrinceEric_014_f
Great idea. We definitely have to have a dessert.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
Yeah, that'd be nice. I can lay down a blanket beside the river and she can swim up alongside me.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
That's a little cold for us, but I bet Ariel would like to explore up there.

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
It would be an adventure.
