Hey, {PlayerName}. I had a thought â you know forks?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Like, the cutlery?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yes. I am aware of forks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You mean "dinglehoppers"?

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
Yes. Forks, as in cutlery.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
They have kind of a boring name, don't they? "Fork."

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
Ariel calls them "dinglehoppers." That's way more fun. Do you think we should change the name?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds kind of confusing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think you're very in love with Ariel.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
I guess you're right.

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
But I still think "dinglehopper" is a great name.

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
Ha. Yeah, I am.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
Maybe changing the name isn't the best idea.

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
I just love how excited she gets about dinglehoppers.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
Sorry, that was a silly question. Of course you're aware of forks.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
Ha! Yes. Exactly. I was just thinking...
