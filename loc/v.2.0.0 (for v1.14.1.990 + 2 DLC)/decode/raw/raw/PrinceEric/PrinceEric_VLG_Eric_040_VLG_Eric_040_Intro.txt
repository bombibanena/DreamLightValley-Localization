Mysterious ruins... and some kind of magic messing with your Compass? Hm...

TAG: PrinceEric_000_f
Hey, {PlayerName}. If you've got some time, I have another mystery that I'd love your help solving.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I always have time for my friends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll come back later.

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
Thanks! So on my last expedition, I was sailing by some mysterious ruins. My Compass started to go haywire... I think some sort of magic was messing with it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
We need to get to the bottom of this!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Magic sure causes a lot of trouble.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
I agree.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
I found an odd Valley artifact while I was sailing by the ruins. Then a storm hit.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
I bet there's more to find in that area if I could just get closer.

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
But when I do, my Compass is useless. So I was thinking â what if we could enchant it to get through the magic?

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
Then I could sell the blueprints for all kinds of amazing artifacts!

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
I'll ask Merlin. He knows a thing or two about enchantments.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
That would be great! Here, take my Compass and the artifact I found. Maybe he can enchant the Compass to lead us back to the ruins.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
I'll say. Magic's been nothing but trouble for Ariel and me. But then again, we couldn't be together on land without it. Anyway...

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
Great! I look forward to it.
