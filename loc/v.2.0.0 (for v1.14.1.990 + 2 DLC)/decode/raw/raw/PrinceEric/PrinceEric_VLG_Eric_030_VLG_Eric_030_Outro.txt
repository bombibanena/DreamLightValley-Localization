I used to bring back all kinds of lost Valley artifacts from my voyages.

We would preserve and archive them, and I'd make blueprints so we could build replicas anytime we wanted.

And now that you've fixed my Compass and brought me new maps, I can start sailing again and sell the blueprints I make here in my House.

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
That'll help me finance future expeditions.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm happy to help with your projects.

I've always wanted to become a patron!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This better be a good investment...

Thanks, {PlayerName}. You're a great friend.

Come by and look at the table in my living room anytime to see if there's something you'd like. I already added some old blueprints I found.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
And I'll add new stuff as often as I can.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
I really appreciate it.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
Ha-ha! Nice Scrooge McDuck impression. Trust me; I think you'll like what I find.
