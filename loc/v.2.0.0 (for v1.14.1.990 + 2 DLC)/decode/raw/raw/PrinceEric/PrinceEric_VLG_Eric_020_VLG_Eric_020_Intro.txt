{PlayerName}, I could use your help solving a mystery that came up while I was being held captive by Ursula.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes. Tell me everything.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Some other time, sorry.

TAG: PrinceEric_000_f
While she had me in her little "garden," Ursula liked to taunt me with something.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
She said there was a way that Ariel wouldn't have to be torn between worlds anymore. That we could be together on land whenever we wanted.

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
She said there's a kind of magic that would allow Ariel to change between human and mermaid.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
I've been looking in every book in Merlin's library, but I can't figure out what she was talking about. It must be Dreamlight Magic.

TAG: Player_000_f
Hmm. So it's all about changing shape... I should speak to Maui...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He's got a power like that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's been around a long time. I bet he's seen a lot of weird magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's a demigod after all.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
Right! Maybe he can teach Ariel.

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. Come back and see me after you talk to him.

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
Yeah, maybe he heard about something like this on one of his adventures.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
Yeah, he probably knows all about this sort of stuff.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
That's okay. I'll be here when you have the time.
