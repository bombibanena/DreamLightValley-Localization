I can't thank you enough, {PlayerName}. There were times when Ursula had me captive that I lost hope. I thought I'd never see Ariel again.

But now, because of you, we're reunited.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm a sucker for a good love story.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I couldn't let Ursula win.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No problem. Helping the Valley is what I do.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
There's just one thing I can't stop thinking about.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
Something Ursula said to taunt me...

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
Actually, never mind. You've already helped me enough for one day. I'm gonna try to solve this mystery on my own.

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
Thanks again, {PlayerName}!
