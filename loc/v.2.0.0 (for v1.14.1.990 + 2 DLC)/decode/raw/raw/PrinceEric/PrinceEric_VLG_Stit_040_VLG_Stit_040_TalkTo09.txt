Hey, Eric... you play the flute, right?

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
I do. But I haven't had much chance to practice lately.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
I'm kind of rusty.

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
Not too rusty, I hope? Stitch is putting together a band. I think it'd be great if you'd play with him.

TAG: PrinceEric_012_f
Kristoff has already agreed to join. I think you'd make a great trio.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You could get some practice with your flute again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Stitch would love to have a prince in his band.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's just for fun. No pressure.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
Well, it would give me the chance to play more and learn some new songs.

TAG: PrinceEric_013_f
Sure, I'll do it!

TAG: PrinceEric_014_f
Great! Start practicing. In the meantime, I'm going to <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>.

TAG: PrinceEric_017_f
Now that we've got a band together, you'll need to put on a concert. Maybe he has some sound equipment he can lend us.

TAG: PrinceEric_015_f
Great! Now I just have to <Lore>find one more band member...</Lore>

TAG: PrinceEric_016_f
Hmm... isn't there someone around here who plays the lute?

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
You might be right. He was asking me something about a music-playing king the other day, but I'd never heard of him.

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
It would be fun to play music with other people again.
