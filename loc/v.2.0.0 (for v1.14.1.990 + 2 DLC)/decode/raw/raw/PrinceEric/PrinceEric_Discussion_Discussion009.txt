Hmm...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You look thoughtful, Eric.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is everything okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hmm?

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
Do I? Well, I've been thinking about something Olaf asked me, and it's a little complicated.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
If you have a ship for a long time, you need to repair it.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
If you repair it so much that you've replaced every piece of it...

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
...is it still the same ship?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes â it's the same ship.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No â it's a different ship.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I don't know.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
I guess so. After all, it looks the same. It feels the same.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
Even though everything is different...

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
Strange to think about, huh?

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
I can see that. After all, it's all new parts. Different wood. New sails.

TAG: PrinceEric_012_f
But even so, it looks the same...

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
Yeah. I don't either. It's funny to think about.

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
Oh, everything's fine. I was just thinking about something Olaf asked me.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
Oh! Sorry, I was lost in thought. Olaf asked me a question that I can't quite figure out.
