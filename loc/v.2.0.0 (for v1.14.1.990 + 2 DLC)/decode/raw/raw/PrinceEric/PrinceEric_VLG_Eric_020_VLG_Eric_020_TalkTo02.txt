Did you learn anything from Maui?

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
He told me we need to enchant an object. I put together everything we need for the spell... except for the object we need to enchant.

TAG: PrinceEric_000_f
Enchanting an object? That sounds familiar...

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
Wait! Ursula! When she made a deal with Ariel for her voice, Ursula used a Nautilus shell pendant.

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
It allowed her to speak with Ariel's voice. So we know they can be enchanted!

TAG: Player_000_f
A Nautilus shell...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's get one.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is that an octopus snail?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I've never fished one out before.

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
It won't be easy; they live deep under the waves, but maybe we can lure one up.

TAG: PrinceEric_013_f
They're scavengers. We'll need something that smells awful, like it comes from the depths of the ocean. I have this <ActivityItem>Fish Gut Oil</ActivityItem> sailors sometimes use.

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
Maybe we can combine it with some other Ingredients... But I'm not sure what would work.

TAG: Player_001_f
I'll ask Remy. He knows everything about...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...how to put together flavors.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...seafood.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...scavenging. He IS a rat.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
That's great! Here, take the <ActivityItem>Fish Gut Oil</ActivityItem> with you. And thanks again for helping me.

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
That's a pretty good description, {PlayerName}.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
That's not surprising. They're rare on the surface but maybe we can lure one up.
