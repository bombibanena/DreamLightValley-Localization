THAT'S IT! I can't take it, {PlayerName}! It's too much!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Whoa, what's too much?

TAG: Hades_003_f
It's Daisy again â she won't let up!

TAG: Hades_004_f
Here I am, fresh off a tiring day of inspiring the masses with my... ME, and she comes over with a to-do list!

TAG: Hades_005_f
Telling me to prep for tomorrow, read this script, sign thatâ AHHH! I can't take it anymore!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I feel you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you ask her for a break?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's the life of a celebrity for you â always on the grind.

TAG: Hades_006_f
This is supposed to be a place where we can all relax and enjoy ourselves!

TAG: Hades_007_f
Exactly! People should come to ME to tell me how much they love me. I shouldn't have to go to THEM!

TAG: Hades_012_f
So is this the end of your celebrity era?

TAG: Hades_013_f
Yes, and good riddance! I just wanna lay back on my lounge chair and let the fans come to me.

TAG: Hades_014_f
At least one good thing came out of all this â my merchandise sold out!

TAG: Hades_016_f
Which proves, one: I have fans; and two: Jerkules isn't the only one who can cash in on fame!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh, congratulations!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Afraid I have some bad news about that...

TAG: Hades_017_f
Hmm... I can't tell if you mean that. Sheesh, I really do need some rest.

TAG: Hades_023_f
I... Fine, I'll leave you alone for now.

TAG: Hades_024_f
Good. Go. Scram! I need some time to think.

TAG: Hades_022_f
There's gotta be an easier way for me to be thunderously appreciated...

TAG: Hades_018_f
Mr. McDuck bought up all the merchandise. He's gonna try to sell it for a higher price later on.

TAG: Hades_019_f
WHAT?!

TAG: Hades_020_f
That... that... Hold on. That PROVES my star is rising! Scrooge is a savvy businessman. He wouldn't invest if he didn't think he could make a profit.

TAG: Hades_021_f
Okay, I gotta think about next steps.

TAG: Hades_015_f
Oh, that's awesome! Congrats!

TAG: Hades_008_f
Excuse me, "ask"? I am not an employee or a child, {PlayerName}. I don't "ask" for anything. I'm a god. I demand things!

TAG: Hades_009_f
How'd that work out for you in the past?

TAG: Hades_010_f
I, well, uh... Look, I've got plans on plans. Everything's a work in progress.

TAG: Hades_011_f
It's too much!
