Okay Hades, I'm back from speaking with Tiana!

TAG: Hades_002_f
She's happy to do the catering for your party. She's wondering if you can do something for her in return.

TAG: Hades_003_f
I'm thinking... I'm thinking... Okay, that's fair.

TAG: Hades_004_f
What's it gonna cost me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You make that sound so ominous...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Nothing too demanding.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How are you at carpentry?

TAG: Hades_005_f
What can I say? Ominous is just sort of my resting aura.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What's that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What would have happened if I kept my eyes open?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I may have peeked a little...

TAG: Hades_008_f
So what does she want?

TAG: Hades_009_f
She wants some help promoting Tiana's Palace around the Valley.

TAG: Hades_010_f
That's easy! I thought she was gonna ask for an intervention with the Fates or something.

TAG: Hades_011_f
Let me think...

TAG: Hades_012_f
Got it! Shut your eyes for a second, {PlayerName}. This next part is kind of a gods-only trick.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Done! Here, take these.

TAG: Hades_014_f
{PlayerName}, as the lord of the Underworld, I've got a special relationship with gems, seeds, metals â basically anything under the earth.

TAG: Hades_018_f
If you <Lore>plant each of those gemstones around Mythopia and water them</Lore>...

TAG: Hades_019_f
They'll grow into regal, elegant signs pointing the way to Tiana's Palace.

TAG: Hades_000_f
Word to the wise (and consider that a compliment) â <Lore>the gems should take about five minutes to grow</Lore>.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Great, I'll hop on that now.

TAG: Hades_022_f
That's a good head minion.

TAG: Hades_024_f
And while you're out, I'll start considering what kind of entertainment we'll need for the party...

TAG: Hades_015_f
Ya know, it would be interesting to find out. I've never really seen a clash between my powers and Dreamlight Magic...

TAG: Hades_017_f
And what did you make for me? Some... gemstones?

TAG: Hades_016_f
Okay. Well, if you feel nauseous and have a new relationship with your mortality, it'll wear off in a year or two.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Perfect!

TAG: Hades_007_f
{PlayerName}, do I seem like I'm the type who looks for splinters? I've got Pain and Panic under my skin most of the time anyway.
