I'mâ Wait. Why do ya ask? What have ya heard?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I haven't heard anything.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I was just curious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're acting... suspicious.

TAG: Hades_001_f
Good. Because I'm not up to anything.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Anyway, I'm just gonna go for a stroll. See the sights. Maybe pick some flowers. You know me; I'm all about the flowers.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Oh. That's actually kinda nice. No one ever just asks me about my day.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Something about "fearing the lord of the Underworld." Which makes sense, I guess.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Still, people can be so judgmental based on your career. Besides, it's not like I asked for the job. Zeus bestowed it on me!

TAG: Hades_006_f
Suspicious? Me? Don't be ridiculous.

You attempt to turn a baby god mortal ONE time, and no one ever trusts you again.
