Okay Hades, your statues have all been set up.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Finally! I thought my flames were gonna start going gray!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's... possible?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I didn't know you could age.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry, I got caught up!

TAG: Hades_003_f
Sheesh, comedy's not your strong suit, is it?

TAG: Hades_004_f
Go see an Aristophanes play and get back to me, all right?

TAG: Hades_005_f
Do you like your statues?

TAG: Hades_006_f
Ya know, I really do. You captured my stature, my commanding presence... I was worried I'd have to hire Phidias, yet â hey â you surprised me.

TAG: Hades_007_f
But...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
There's always a "but," isn't there...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
But you need more help with something...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Wait, lemme guess.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Hey, leave the sarcasm to me, okay? It just doesn't have the right bite without a few millennia of cynicism behind it.

TAG: Hades_023_f
Oh, and take some initiative too, would ya? I'll be busy. It's the one day a month I have to listen to the dead's grievances...

TAG: Hades_010_f
Okay, so what do you want?

TAG: Hades_011_f
I don't know... respect. Adoration. Constant groveling. Basically, everything I'm due. But everyone here is so... nice. I can't trust 'em to be honest about the changes I made around here.

TAG: Hades_012_f
So I need you to go incognito and listen in on what they're saying.

TAG: Hades_013_f
You sure you don't want me to just ask people directly?

TAG: Hades_014_f
NO! People lie. They butter you up for their own gain.

TAG: Hades_015_f
No, you need to <Lore>disguise yourself and listen in</Lore> at some kind of agora space where everyone gathers, like the uh... the <Lore>Library of Lore</Lore>!

TAG: Hades_021_f
Get yourself some <Lore>Rustic Green and Brown</Lore> clothing â should help you blend right in.

TAG: Hades_022_f
All right, I'll give it a shot.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Do my eyes deceive me? A Fate... with two eyes?!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You want to get back at Zeus.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You need to contact the Fates.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You feel inadequate compared to Zeus.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Well, yes, eternally... but that's not THIS thing.

TAG: Hades_018_f
WRONG!

TAG: Hades_019_f
Wow, I ask for an assistant and I get a therapist.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Trust me, {PlayerName}; you're not ready for what's really in my head.

TAG: Hades_000_f
That's fair â you don't want me in there, and I don't want to go.

TAG: Hades_016_f
Well, lucky for you I can let bygones be bygones... for those who grovel.
