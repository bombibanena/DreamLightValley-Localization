Okay, okay, {PlayerName}, we need to have a little chat about your so-called job performance.

TAG: Hades_002_f
I'm STILL not back on Mount Olympus. Which means you're definitely NOT gonna make minion of the month.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm working as fast as I can!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
So why don't you do it yourself?

TAG: Hades_003_f
I think I'm one step closer to getting inside Mount Olympus.

TAG: Hades_004_f
But I've run into a little problem.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Good news. Bad news. How's this... I'm empowering you to use that brain of yours to solve that little problem.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Two brains are better than one.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
But you've got such an impressive brain. You could help me a lot!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You know, a good boss is always willing to talk things out with his minions...

TAG: Hades_019_f
You'd think, but Pain and Panic have two brains, and they couldn't even manage to take care of Hercules. When he was a BABY!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
There has to be a way.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Is there anything you two DIDN'T mess up around here?

TAG: Hades_022_f
But fine, I get it. If it's gonna help me get back to Mount Olympus... let's talk it out. Go.

TAG: Hades_010_f
I found another Mythic Trial. If I could just get inside, I could get us one step closer to Mount Olympus.

TAG: Hades_011_f
But there are these blue and green flames scattered around it. I can't get past them.

TAG: Hades_012_f
Ah. Right. Those.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Ya see, Maleficent and I had a little... disagreement.

TAG: Hades_014_f
A disagreement that ended with some fireballs being tossed around.

TAG: Hades_015_f
I tried to get rid of the fire, but since it's got some of Maleficent's magic in it...

TAG: Hades_016_f
Nada. Nothin'. Won't budge.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Well, that Aurora lady... I heard she managed to get rid of a few of the flames.

TAG: Hades_024_f
Had somethin' to do with a <Lore>Sacred Spring</Lore> filled with magical waters.

TAG: Hades_025_f
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find it.

TAG: Hades_026_f
Then I guess we're right back where we started. But maybe <Lore>the Lorekeeper can help</Lore>.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'll go talk to her.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Thanks for nothing, I guess.

TAG: Hades_027_f
Sounds like a great idea. Especially since it requires nothing from me.

TAG: Hades_030_f
<Lore>Have a schmooze with that tattered old book</Lore> and you'll have me back on Mount Olympus in no time!

TAG: Hades_028_f
Hey! The best managers don't solve their minions' problems for them.

TAG: Hades_029_f
Figuring this out yourself is the only way you can learn and grow. Ugh. That made me a little sick just saying it. Anyway...

TAG: Hades_018_f
Point taken. BUT, a good minion focuses on solutions, not problems. Let me think...

TAG: Hades_020_f
Okay, okay, you've got a point.

TAG: Hades_023_f
If it's gonna help put me back on Mount Olympus, let's talk it out. What's the problem?

TAG: Hades_021_f
All right, all right.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Oh, I'd be happy to.

TAG: Hades_006_f
If it weren't for all that ink blocking the way that only YOUR little magic tricks can get rid of!

TAG: Hades_007_f
Well, that's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
