I'm back from talking to Remy!

TAG: Hades_001_f
He's cool with you taking over Chez Remy for today, and I even got a stock of ingredients for you if you're going to be doing a Greek dish.

TAG: Hades_002_f
YES! That rodent's not gonna know what hit him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm looking forward to trying your food!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Please don't hit Remy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll ready my best "Opa!" shout.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Well, when you're nice to a god like that, you usually get rewarded.

TAG: Hades_006_f
All right, well good luck.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Luck! HA, I don't need luck!

TAG: Hades_008_f
Just watch. Remy's gonna be begging me for business advice after this.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Figure of speech. But out of curiosity, why? Did he say something bad about me?

TAG: Hades_009_f
No, just on principle... don't be mean to the Villagers.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Listen, when I break something, it's on purpose!
