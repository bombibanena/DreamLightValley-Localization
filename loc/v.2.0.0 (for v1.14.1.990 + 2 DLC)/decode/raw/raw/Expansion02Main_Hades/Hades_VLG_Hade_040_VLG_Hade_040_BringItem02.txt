Invitations are all sent!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Ah, nothing like a good scheme coming together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Excuse me, "scheme"?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, they're more fun when you have competent help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Now you just need to bring the DJ skills.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Plan? Goal? Come on, {PlayerName}; I'm not a thesaurus.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Sorry, I guess I'm used to that sort of word choice having ominous connotations.

TAG: Hades_015_f
I get it. But as my faithful head minion, I recommend you stop jumping to conclusions.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Or what about a nature theme? Green, Brown and Sporty could be interesting. You'll be wearing it â what do you think?

TAG: Player_001_f
Personally, I'd prefer to dress up in...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
White, Yellow, and Elegant.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Red, Yellow, and Modern.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Green, Brown, and Sporty.

TAG: Hades_003_f
So, how's the DJ practice going?

TAG: Hades_011_f
Good. I'm really gettin' the hang of it.

TAG: Hades_012_f
My guests are gonna be treated to a revolution in music!

TAG: Hades_013_f
Wow, you seem quite sure of yourself.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Oh, you'll see! Okay, next on the list... You are definitely not dressed for the kind of classy function I'm tryin' to cultivate here.

TAG: Hades_006_f
But... I'm having a hard time deciding on a dress code for the party.

TAG: Hades_018_f
At first I thought White, Yellow, and Elegant to steal Zeus's thunder...

TAG: Hades_019_f
But then, why would I want to imitate him? So, I could go Red, Yellow and Modern for a fiery look that says "I do what I want!"

TAG: Hades_000_f
Which of these dress codes would I go with?

TAG: Hades_021_f
It's gotta be Olympus-core â show Zeus that you can do his style better than him!

TAG: Hades_024_f
Okay, okay... I can see it. Well, you know your dress code.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Dionysus is gonna flip when he hears I out party-hosted him!

TAG: Hades_025_f
Oh, and by the way, to make things easy, I've set up a little portal to zoom you and the other guests to the party location.

TAG: Hades_022_f
Definitely the modern Hephaestus-core look. Your blue highlights will stand out and everyone will notice you!

TAG: Hades_023_f
Earthy and sporty? I'd call that Artemis-core and would love to dress up like that!

TAG: Hades_007_f
I get it. But as my faithful intermediate minion, I recommend you stop jumping to conclusions.

TAG: Hades_008_f
I get it. But as my faithful associate minion, I recommend you stop jumping to conclusions.

TAG: Hades_009_f
I get it. But as my faithful junior minion, I recommend you stop jumping to conclusions.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Yep. Working with you has made me realize just how useless Pain and Panic really are.
