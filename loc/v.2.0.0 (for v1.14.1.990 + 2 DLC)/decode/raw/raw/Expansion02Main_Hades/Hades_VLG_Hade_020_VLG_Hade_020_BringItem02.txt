Finally, if somebody at my temple made me wait that long for a gift, they'd be dealing with what we in the biz like to call "ironic consequences."

... {PlayerName}, is this supposed to be a joke?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I mean, it is kinda funny.

Anyone ever tell you you've got a lousy sense of humor? 'Cause if they haven't, let me be the first!

BUT... what about Scrooge? His shop is complex, sophisticated â that's what I need!

TAG: Hades_013_f
I'll just mosey on over there and demand that he let me take over.

TAG: Hades_011_f
Why don't I go ask for you? If I know Mr. McDuck, he'll respond far better to politeness than to demands...

TAG: Hades_014_f
Offering to do things for me? See, my management skills at work. Now go!

TAG: Hades_005_f
I never should've trusted her. Not without something to hold over her.

TAG: Hades_006_f
My faithful minion, nice work on the empathy. I'll remember that.
