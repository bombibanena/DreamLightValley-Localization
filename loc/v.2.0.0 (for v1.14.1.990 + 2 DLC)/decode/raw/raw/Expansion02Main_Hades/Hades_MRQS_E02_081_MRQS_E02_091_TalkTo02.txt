Okay, that didn't go exactly how I planned...

TAG: Hades_002_f
But hey, learning from failure is an important part of becoming a better minion, am I right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll try something else, boss!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uh, not to be rude, but pulling that lever was YOUR idea.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't WANT to become a better minion.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Great! You got this.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Look, there's gotta be a way to fix this.

TAG: Hades_003_f
There's a few tons of leftover marble around from when I had that statue of myself built.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Think you could <Lore>use that marble to hold up the drawbridge</Lore>?

TAG: Hades_006_f
Yeah, I think our problem here is really an issue of execution.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Well, great. Because with that attitude...

TAG: Hades_008_f
...YOU NEVER WILL!
