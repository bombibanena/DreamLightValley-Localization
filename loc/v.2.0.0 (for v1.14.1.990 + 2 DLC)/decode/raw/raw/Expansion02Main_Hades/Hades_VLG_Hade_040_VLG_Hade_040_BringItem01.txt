There you go, Hades; one DJ table, fashioned in quality Greek marble!

TAG: Hades_002_f
I... Whoa, I haven't been this choked up since I got a hunk of moussakaâ Ya now what? Been there, done that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Happy you like it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Better start practicing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I can send Vanellope over to give some advice if you want.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Yep, that promotion is looking more and more likely, my competent minion.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Now... I think we need to talk invitations.

TAG: Hades_015_f
Sure! Have you thought about stationary? I can go craftâ

TAG: Hades_016_f
{PlayerName}, {PlayerName}, {PlayerName}, still thinking like a mortal.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Well, I AM a mortal...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Paper is mortal?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Hey, mortals have thought up some cool stuff!

TAG: Hades_020_f
Hey, I try to be polite and not bring it up, but you keep ruining that.

TAG: Hades_024_f
But let's get back to the invitations.

TAG: Hades_017_f
I'm planning a party fit for the gods themselves! We need something better than just paper.

TAG: Hades_018_f
No, you're gonna <Lore>catch some Bird Snippets for me</Lore>. I'll write the invitations on them so that when I release 'em, they fly straight to the invitees!

TAG: Hades_000_f
The <Lore>blue ones from the Bind</Lore> should do the trick.

TAG: Hades_019_f
Okay, I'll get on that!

TAG: Hades_021_f
Sheesh. You're givin' me a headache. One moment you've got great ideas, and the next, "is paper mortal?"!

TAG: Hades_022_f
Fair enough â you did bring me the DJ table.

TAG: Hades_023_f
I revise my prior statement â mortals can be good at bringing you stuff.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Are you saying I'm gonna be terrible at this?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sure you'll be great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
DJing is hard!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Well, if you don't practice, you definitely will be terrible.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Of course I'll be great â I'm Hades!

TAG: Hades_008_f
For you, maybe. But I'm kind of a god.

TAG: Hades_009_f
If I wanted to consult a philosopher, believe me, I know a few.

TAG: Hades_010_f
... {PlayerName}, we were getting along so well and then you had to go and ruin it.

TAG: Hades_011_f
I'm just saying that Vanellope might have some good advice, being a digital person and all. There might have been a DJ game in her home arcade.

TAG: Hades_012_f
I'm just gonna say this one more time... I DO NOT need mortals telling me what to do and that goes double for "digital persons"!

TAG: Hades_013_f
Fine! Suit yourself...
