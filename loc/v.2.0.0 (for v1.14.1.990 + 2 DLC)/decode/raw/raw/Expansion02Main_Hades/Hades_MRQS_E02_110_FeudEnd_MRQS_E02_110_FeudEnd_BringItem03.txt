{PlayerName}! What's this?

TAG: Hades_001_f
An apology from Maleficent? Yeah, not likely.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Wait a second. Is this an invitation?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh humble lord of the Underworld, we request your presence...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you like the little blue flame we added?

TAG: Hades_003_f
Heyyyy, now that's the kinda respect I deserve.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Not like what I get from any of the gods at Zeus's parties.

TAG: Hades_007_f
But hold on now â what are you inviting me to? Merlin's retirement bash?

TAG: Hades_008_f
It's a very important meeting with the Lorekeeper. We need YOUR help to stop the Neverafter.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Let me see here... "We invite you to the first meeting of the <Lore>Grand Council of the Neverafter</Lore>"?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
We can't do it without you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You'd be the guest of honor.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Look, are you coming or not?

TAG: Hades_009_f
Ya know, I would like to deal with all of the ink around here. It's really messing up the ambiance.

TAG: Hades_010_f
But before I RSVP to this thing, I've got one question...

TAG: Hades_011_f
Is Maleficent gonna be there?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
She's going to be there, Hades.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Hopefully.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Why don't you show up and find out?

TAG: Hades_012_f
Urrgghh, I knew there had to be a catch.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Ignore her. This gathering is ALL about you!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
You two NEED to put this silly feud aside for the good of the Vale.

TAG: Player_003_choice_003_f
Fine. Don't come. Enjoy ruling over a kingdom flooded in ink.

TAG: Hades_016_f
Yeah, right. Maleficent takes over every party she shows up at.

TAG: Hades_019_f
Ya know, she's the one who started all this.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Everything was goin' great until she put some kinda whammy on me. Then all that ink started showing up on Mount Olympus.

TAG: Hades_021_f
That's weird. Maleficent told me that YOU started the feud, and that the ink started appearing in her castle first.

TAG: Hades_022_f
What? You don't actually believe that, do you? Honesty's not exactly one of her virtues.

TAG: Hades_028_f
Mine either, but that's not really the point here.

TAG: Hades_023_f
Look, I'll show up at this little shindig to help fix the Neverafter. But once that's done? Maleficent had better stay OUT of my territory.

TAG: Hades_024_f
Maleficent cursed Mount Olympus? That's weird.

TAG: Hades_025_f
I'll ask her about it.

TAG: Hades_026_f
Yeah, I'm sure she'll be real forthcoming about that.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Hey! It's Maleficent who needs to leave me alone!

TAG: Hades_018_f
Hey! That ink isn't my doing.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Don't get cute. That means she's DEFINITELY gonna be there.

TAG: Hades_015_f
Let me see here... "We invite you to join the <Lore>Guardians of the Vale</Lore>"?

TAG: Hades_027_f
Let me see here... "We invite you to join <Lore>the Lorekeeper's Legion</Lore>"?

TAG: Hades_005_f
I gotta admit, it's a great touch.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Zeus could never manage that kinda class.
