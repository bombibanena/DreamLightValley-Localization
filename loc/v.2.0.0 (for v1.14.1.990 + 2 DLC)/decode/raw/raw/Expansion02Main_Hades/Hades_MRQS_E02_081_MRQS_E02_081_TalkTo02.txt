Nicely done, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Hades_001_f
I'd say your work here... meets expectations.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You did a great job managing me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uh... thanks, I guess.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
ExCUSE me? My work EXCEEDS expectations, thank you very much!

TAG: Hades_003_f
Of course I did, my loyal minion.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Looks like the bridge has risen. So go ahead; work your magic...

TAG: Hades_008_f
...and get me one step closer to my throne room on Mount Olympus.

Don't mention it. I know how important positive reinforcement is for junior minions.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Whoa, whoa, whoa, {PlayerName}! Handling feedback is a CRUCIAL quality in a junior employee.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Don't make me put you on a minion-improvement plan. Anyway...
