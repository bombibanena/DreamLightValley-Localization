So... how you feeling about your job training?

TAG: Hades_001_f
Kicking me out like that... saying I can't handle customer service.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Sounds like Scrooge is angling for an eternity being heckled by horrible customers.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Oooh, okay, I see that you're upset.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Serves you right.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's take a deeeeeep breath.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I feel you; I hate customer service too.

TAG: Hades_004_f
How dare you! I... I should unleash the Titans on Scrooge's Store!

TAG: Hades_005_f
Maybe he'll be less smug when he's a frozen ice block being whipped around in a tornado.

TAG: Hades_010_f
I'm guessing you don't think you proved your management skills. But did you learn anything valuable?

TAG: Hades_011_f
Oh, I've learned something all right.

TAG: Hades_012_f
This whole thing was a colossal mistake! I'm a god, I shouldn't be... serving anyone.

TAG: Hades_013_f
I'm made for giving commands, not taking them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oddly enough, hating customer service is a very mortal experience.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
So really, you've learned nothing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What if you think of it as "helping" instead of "serving" others?

TAG: Hades_014_f
Haven't you insulted me enough?

TAG: Hades_017_f
No, no, I clearly need to re-evaluate things, come up with some better schemes.

TAG: Hades_018_f
Something that lets everyone know exactly the kind of grandeur and respect I deserve.

TAG: Hades_019_f
Okay, well, I'll let you think that over.

TAG: Hades_024_f
Good. Ya know, this might not have gone exactly as planned, but you definitely were a solid head minion.

TAG: Hades_023_f
Keep this up and I might give you another promotion!

TAG: Hades_020_f
Good. Ya know, this might not have gone exactly as planned, but you definitely were a solid intermediate minion.

TAG: Hades_021_f
Good. Ya know, this might not have gone exactly as planned, but you definitely were a solid associate minion.

TAG: Hades_022_f
Good. Ya know, this might not have gone exactly as planned, but you definitely were a solid junior minion.

TAG: Hades_015_f
Oh, I've learned all I need to know about this whole "work" concept.

TAG: Hades_016_f
Yeah, that doesn't change anything.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Look at me, I'm practically breaking out in brimstone from the stress.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Okay, deep breath...

TAG: Hades_008_f
{PlayerName}, as lord of the Underworld, I thought I had a handle on eternal suffering.

TAG: Hades_009_f
But wow... you mortals have been cooking up something nasty.
