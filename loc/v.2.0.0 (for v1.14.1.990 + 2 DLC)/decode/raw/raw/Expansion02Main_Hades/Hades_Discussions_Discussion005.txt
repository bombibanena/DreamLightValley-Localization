Seriously? Did you just ask me that?

TAG: Hades_001_f
Rule number one, {PlayerName}: You can't just ask someone if they have an evil scheme.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why not?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That was kind of rude, sorry.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But you do, don't you?

TAG: Hades_002_f
Because it's... Never mind! The important thing is my schemes aren't EVIL. They're just balancing the cosmos by putting me in charge which is how it should be.

TAG: Hades_003_f
I'd say more about it, but that'd ruin the surprise.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Yes, it was. Lucky for you, I'm a stand-up sorta guy and I forgive you.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Yes, I do. Obviously I have an evil scheme! I have schemes on schemes. I'm LOUSY with schemes.

TAG: Hades_006_f
But I'm not gonna tell you about it. That'd ruin the surprise.
