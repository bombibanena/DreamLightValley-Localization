Okay, signs are up and Tiana is working on the catering!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Good, good. Now let's talk entertainment.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Orpheus would normally be the go-to, but... we're not exactly on speaking terms at the moment.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Orpheus?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What about me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What about some of the Villagers?

TAG: Hades_004_f
Big-time Greek musician. Really top of the charts. I was gonna break one of my cardinal rules for him. All he had to do was walk out of my Underworld without looking back. But could he? No.

TAG: Hades_016_f
All right, let's go!

TAG: Hades_005_f
Really, it's his own fault, but he insists on blaming me for what he lost.

TAG: Hades_006_f
No, I think we'll have to recruit one of the Villagers here.

TAG: Hades_010_f
They're always humming to themselves. Surely one of them knows a setlist suitable for my party?

TAG: Hades_011_f
I've been... observing and I have a few candidates lined up. But I'll need you to tag along, give me a second opinion, and help me convince them to perform if they don't jump at the opportunity.

TAG: Hades_012_f
Sure, who are we going to audition?

TAG: Hades_013_f
I wanna <Lore>talk to Mirabel and Eric</Lore>.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Her voice doesn't make me yearn to claw my ears off. It's... nice, peppy, not gonna steal my thunder.

TAG: Hades_015_f
And Eric... Well, that little flute of his does kinda make me nostalgic for the Greek double flute.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Uhh... No.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Look, for all I know you're a genius on the lyre, but this is for MY party, and we can't have you being the center of attention now, can we?

TAG: Hades_009_f
Wait â your magic doesn't let you read minds, does it? Actually, never mind. We'll circle back to that. Now, about the Villagers...
