Hades! Look â it's the same magical corruption we saw inside the first Mythic Trial!

TAG: Hades_005_f
Only one problem. How do we get to it?

TAG: Hades_006_f
Oh that? That's easy.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Do you know anything about a jerk named Prometheus?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He stole fire from the gods, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He was a Titan, wasn't he?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No idea who you're talking about.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Bingo. And let's just say old Zeusy was none too pleased.

TAG: Hades_009_f
You ever see Zeus when he's really angry? Trust me. You'll have a lot more appreciation for what a nice guy I am.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Anyway, you're gonna have to make like Prometheus here.

TAG: Hades_002_f
We've got some torches, we've got some places for torches...

TAG: Hades_003_f
So, you'll have to find all the torches and get 'em into the right spots.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Are you going to help, or...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Okay. I'm on it.

TAG: Hades_015_f
I just told you exactly what to do. And that, my friend, is helping!

TAG: Hades_016_f
Look, how about I do the managing, and you do the minioning?

TAG: Hades_017_f
Now that is some good minioning, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Hades_018_f
Keep that up, and there just might be a promotion in your future.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Oh yeah. He's the one who stole fire from Mount Olympus, and let me tell you, old Zeusy was not happy about it.

TAG: Hades_012_f
Seriously? What are they teachin' you kids these days?

TAG: Hades_013_f
Short version: Prometheus was a Titan. Stole fire from Mount Olympus. Ringing any bells yet? Made Zeus extremely mad.
