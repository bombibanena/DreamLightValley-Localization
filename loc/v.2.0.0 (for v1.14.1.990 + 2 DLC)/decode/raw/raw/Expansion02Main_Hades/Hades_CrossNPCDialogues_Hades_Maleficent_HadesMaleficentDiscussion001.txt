Ahh... Maleficent. You, uh... you're lookin' a little greener than usual. It's really workin' for ya.

TAG: Hades_009_f
I guess I can too.

TAG: Hades_001_f
My appearance is entirely irrelevant to the task at hand.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Deeper magic? What are we talkin' about here?

TAG: Hades_007_f
Something is wrong with the Vale. Something beyond the two of us.

TAG: Hades_004_f
I am willing to overlook your disrespect, for now...

TAG: Hades_008_f
...because if we don't set aside this dispute, there may not be a Vale left to rule over.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Hey, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones temporarily...
