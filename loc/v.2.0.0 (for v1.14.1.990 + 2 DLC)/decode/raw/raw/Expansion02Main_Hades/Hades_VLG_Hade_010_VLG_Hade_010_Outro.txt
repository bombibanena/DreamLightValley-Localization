Okay Hades, got you a Lightning Generator! It's a machine fueled by Lightning Spice.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Just what you always wanted?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A good-quality bolt of lightning?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not what you wanted after all?

TAG: Hades_002_f
According to the Villagers, it's the one thing missing with your statues.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Ya know, you're right! I've been on the receiving end of those bolts often enough; it'll be nice to fling 'em myself for once!

TAG: Hades_004_f
Now... Hades needs some shiny, new lightning bolts â let's get this puppy running!

TAG: Hades_005_f
Uhh, first I should pass along a warning from the Lorekeeper about putting in too muchâ

TAG: Hades_006_f
Yeah, yeah, read me the 40-page end-user agreement later. IT'S LIGHTNING TIME!

TAG: Hades_016_f
...

TAG: Hades_008_f
Well, that's...

TAG: Hades_017_f
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THAT'S PATHETIC!

TAG: Hades_009_f
How am I gonna show up Zeus when my lightning wouldn't even make it outta the cloud?

TAG: Hades_018_f
This machine needs more power. I think I have some more Lightning Spice around here somewhere...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Not sure you want to do that...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Oh, keep going...

TAG: Hades_021_f
The Lorekeeper said...

TAG: Hades_022_f
And this lightning better be blue! None of that sunshiny yellow lightning for me!

TAG: Hades_038_f
...

TAG: Hades_025_f
This is why I hate lightning.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Are you okay?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I told you not to overload the machine!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Yeah, lightning is terrible!

TAG: Hades_026_f
Well, I'm not exactly peachy...

TAG: Hades_027_f
But yeah, I guess I'm fine.

TAG: Hades_031_f
Ugh, why do I even bother trying to imitate Zeus?

TAG: Hades_032_f
I'm smarter than him, OBVIOUSLY more charming, a monumentally superior strategist...

TAG: Hades_033_f
I just need to forget about the lightning! You wouldn't happen to know a good hypnotist, would ya, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Hades_034_f
Hypnotist, no. But Mickey always knows how to cheer me up.

TAG: Hades_035_f
Mickey?! Spare me. That is WAY too much cheer. Never mind. Go putter around with the other mortals and give me some space.

TAG: Hades_036_f
Okay, well if you need anything...

TAG: Hades_037_f
Yeah, yeah, you're at my service. Tell me something I don't know. Now scram.

TAG: Hades_028_f
Well, I guess you didn't tell me fast enough!

TAG: Hades_029_f
This is all your fault.

TAG: Hades_030_f
Now, that's what I like to hear!

TAG: Hades_020_f
Zeus won't be so smug when he eats one of my bolts for breakfast!
