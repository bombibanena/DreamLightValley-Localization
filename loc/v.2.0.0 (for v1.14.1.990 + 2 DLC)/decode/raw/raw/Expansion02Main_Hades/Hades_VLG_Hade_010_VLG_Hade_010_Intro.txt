{PlayerName}! Finally! I've been working myself to death here. Get it? Anyway...

TAG: Hades_002_f
You â you're the helpful type, right? All keen, eager, and useful?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, I try...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, busy... helping someone else.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Excellent! Because have I got an opportunity for you!

TAG: Hades_004_f
I'm listening.

TAG: Hades_005_f
So, put yourself in my sandals. You're a god; you've got incredible power, sizzling wit and hey, not a bad mug, if I do say so myself. You follow?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sure, keep going.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'd rather not...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I have the sudden urge to scheme with the Fates.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Someone like me deserves a little class. A lot, actually. I'm talkin' about a domain to reflect my status and dignity.

TAG: Hades_007_f
But have you seen the <Lore>Elysian Fields</Lore>?! It's a disaster! Broken statues everywhere! Demon Snippets running amok!

TAG: Hades_008_f
It looks like Wonder Boy had a temper tantrum in a marble quarry.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What happened?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Can't you do it yourself?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Oof, that does sound annoying.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Well, you know how it goes... You get yourself a nice new domain, try to make it all homey...

TAG: Hades_024_f
Oh, and hey... if some of those flowers happen to be on the head of a dryad... you don't know me.

TAG: Hades_011_f
...and then SOMEONE decides they need to redecorate your place with green flames and thorns.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Huh, that kinda sounds like Maleficent.

TAG: Hades_018_f
BINGO! Shame, really. I thought she and I were gonna be simpatico until things went sideways.

TAG: Hades_019_f
She really did a number here. I'm still tryin' to figure out how I'm gonna get back at her.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Okay, what do you need me to do?

TAG: Hades_021_f
Well, those chunks of sculpture are pretty tough. But, bring me some <ActivityItem>of the magical resources from Mythopia</ActivityItem>, and I'll see about bestowing some god-like powers on your Pickaxe.

TAG: Hades_022_f
Out of the pure goodness of my heart, of course.

TAG: Hades_023_f
Sure, on it!

TAG: Hades_012_f
Hello? God here. Literally the lord of the Underworld and you want me to... clean?

TAG: Hades_013_f
I'm giving you the chance to do a favor for a god! I thought you mortals went wild for that sort of thing.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Finally, some recognition!

TAG: Hades_015_f
Heh. A comedian. Great. Anyway...

TAG: Hades_016_f
That's what I'm talkin' about!
