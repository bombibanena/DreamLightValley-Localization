You wanted something, Hades?

TAG: Hades_001_f
I can't believe you've been keeping this fact about myself from me this whole time!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oookay, let's figure this out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh, no way am I dealing with this now.

TAG: Hades_002_f
What's going on? What have I been apparently keeping from you?

TAG: Hades_003_f
That here, I'm a CELEBRITY!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
... You are?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who told you that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I thought you already knew.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Minnie told me ALL about how here, it's "celebrities" who have fans.

TAG: Hades_015_f
But I'll send her a message to <Lore>come to my House</Lore> â I'm a celebrity and people should come to me, not the other way around!

TAG: Hades_007_f
And what these fans want most is to interact with and gain the favor of their favorite "celebrities."

TAG: Hades_008_f
Yeah, that's kinda how it works.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Well, that explains everything! Nobody's been showing me the proper respect here because...

TAG: Hades_010_f
...they don't know me as a celebrity!

TAG: Hades_011_f
We need to reframe everything. Which means you â as my minion â have got a lot of work to do.

TAG: Hades_012_f
All right, well I can give you a hand with that.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Why don't we <Lore>go talk to Daisy</Lore>? Maybe she can give you some suggestions on how to communicate that you're a celebrity.

TAG: Hades_014_f
That could work. I need to up my game â can't have Jerkules be the only one with his own line of merchandise.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Hey, I knew people knew me, obviously. Big picture. But not the DETAILS of fame.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Minnie said that here it's "celebrities" who have fans.
