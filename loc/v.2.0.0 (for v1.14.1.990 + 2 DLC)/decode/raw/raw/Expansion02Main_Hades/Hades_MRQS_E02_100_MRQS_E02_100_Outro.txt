So, all the trouble around here was caused by those little things I took from the Lorekeeper, huh?

TAG: Hades_002_f
Oh well. I'm back in my throne room and ready to rule over my part of the cosmos!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ready to promote me to CEO of minion resources?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not so fast. You're not going to be ruling anything.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I held up my end of the bargain. You hold up yours.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Uh, sure. Now that I'm back on Mount Olympus, call yourself whatever you want.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Great. Then my first act as CEO will be to request you resolve your little feud with Maleficent.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Right, right. Maleficent. I almost forgot about her... Wishful thinking.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Okay, fine. I guess I can put up with having her around occasionally...

TAG: Hades_011_f
...if SHE apologizes to ME!

TAG: Hades_012_f
I was worried you were going to say that. Maleficent wants YOU to apologize to her.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Apologize to HER? For WHAT?

TAG: Hades_014_f
You know, that lady really has some nerve.

TAG: Hades_015_f
If I didn't despise her, I'd almost respect it. Almost.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Come on, Hades. Tell her you're sorry and let's move on.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
So you won't apologize to her unless she apologizes to you...

TAG: Hades_016_f
Nuh-uh. Not a chance. Nope.

TAG: Hades_019_f
*sigh* ... So neither of you wants to apologize until the other does.

TAG: Hades_018_f
You ever hear of something called a Gordian knot? Sounds like you've got yourself one of those.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Seriously, though, I appreciate you getting me back to Mount Olympus.

TAG: Hades_021_f
I guess I'm going to have to <Lore>talk to the Lorekeeper</Lore> about how to solve this.

TAG: Hades_017_f
...and she won't apologize to me unless I apologize to her.

TAG: Hades_022_f
Why do I get the feeling that Maleficent isn't going to be too eager to apologize?

TAG: Hades_023_f
Because she's a stubborn snake with an ego bigger than Zeus's?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Are you describing her or you?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I mean, you're not wrong.

TAG: Hades_024_f
Hey! My ego is the exact appropriate size, thank you.

TAG: Hades_026_f
I guess I'll have to <Lore>explore Everafter to reach Maleficent's castle</Lore> and see if she's willing to apologize.

TAG: Hades_027_f
Here goes nothing.

TAG: Hades_025_f
Trust me. When you meet Maleficent, you're gonna understand. She's impossible!

TAG: Hades_004_f
Excuse me? Who put you in charge of who gets to be in charge?

TAG: Hades_008_f
I'm the Ruler of the Storybook Vale. It's the only way to resolve your little feud with Maleficent. NEITHER of you get to be in charge.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Oh, right. We had some kind of deal? Gotta say, it's slipped my mind.

TAG: Hades_007_f
I helped you get back to Mount Olympus. Now YOU need to resolve your silly little feud with Maleficent.
