Let's see... my favorite thing?

TAG: Hades_001_f
There's just so much to love! How can I choose?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're being sarcastic, aren't you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No need to be rude, Hades.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I like all the Villagers!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Of course I'm being sarcastic! It's me here!

TAG: Hades_003_f
As if I, Hades, have spent any time thinking about things I may or may not love about this place.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
So... it's all the delicious food, isn't it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You love the people, don't you?

TAG: Hades_010_f
I mean... sure, yeah, the food isn't terrible.

TAG: Hades_011_f
That Mickey guy can make a mean apple pie, let me tell you.

TAG: Hades_012_f
Ugh, yuck, no! People should fear and worship me! Everyone here is too happy for that.

TAG: Hades_013_f
...I mean okay, sure, it's been nice catching up with some previous acquaintances from the Valley. Mother Gothel and I haven't had a chat in ages.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Oh, was that rude? Gee, I'm SO sorry.

TAG: Hades_005_f
In case it wasn't clear, that was more sarcasm.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Hey, I'm kidding. Kinda. Mostly. Chin up, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Hades_006_f
...

TAG: Hades_007_f
I was being sarcastic, but hey, your "totally sincere" thing? It's a good angle.
