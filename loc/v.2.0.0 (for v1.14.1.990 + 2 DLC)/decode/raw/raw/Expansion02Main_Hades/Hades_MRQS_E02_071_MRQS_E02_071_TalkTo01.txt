Finally! What's a god gotta do to get some decent service around here?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is there something you need help with?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Whoa! Hades?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hey! I'm not your employee, you know.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Help? Whoa, whoa, whoa. That makes it sound like I couldn't handle it myself.

TAG: Hades_025_f
Let's get this straight... I don't NEED help. I just EXPECT the respect I oh-so-deservedly deserve.

TAG: Hades_026_f
Look, I don't wanna brag but I'm sort of a big deal around here.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Name's Hades, lord of the dead. Hi. How ya doin'?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How did you get here?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you stuck here...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What's your whole deal?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
I need you to stop feuding with Maleficent.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
What exactly do you need me to do?

TAG: Hades_010_f
Well, it's pretty simple really. I was lounging up on Mount Olympus, ruling over my part of the cosmos, minding my own business...

TAG: Hades_011_f
...when all this ink started shooting up out of the ground!

TAG: Hades_012_f
Then everything started rumbling and BAM â I'm here, in this place! Wherever here is...

TAG: Hades_047_f
What exactly do you need me to do?

TAG: Hades_041_f
See this cart?

TAG: Hades_042_f
Help me get it across. It's got a bunch of <ActivityItem>Vases</ActivityItem> in it that are gonna look great around Mount Olympus.

TAG: Hades_043_f
But let's face it: Right now, this place is a monumental mess. I mean, look at all this stuff in the way!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'm on it!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
You're doing all this for some fancy-looking vases?

TAG: Hades_045_f
I like your attitude.

TAG: Hades_034_f
Normally, I'd send Pain and Panic to do my pilfering and plundering, but I've got no idea what rock those worms are hiding under.

TAG: Hades_044_f
And even if they were here, I've got no ferryman to get everything across for me!

TAG: Hades_035_f
I'm tellin' ya, it is so hard to find good help these days.

TAG: Hades_023_f
So, uh, why don't you start by <Lore>giving this cart a little push</Lore>? Hope that's not TOO complicated for ya.

TAG: Hades_046_f
Trust me. Those, ahem... "fancy-lookin' " vases are really gonna tie the place together. It's a whole theme I've been workin' on.

TAG: Hades_027_f
Whoa, what? Stuck? No, no, no. You've got it all wrong.

TAG: Hades_028_f
I COULD leave anytime I want. I just don't WANT to at this particular moment.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Why don't you want to leave?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You're TOTALLY stuck down here.

TAG: Hades_029_f
Because there's something down here I want.

TAG: Hades_039_f
And the second I get it, I'll leave, crush Maleficent, take my rightful place as ruler of the Vale...

TAG: Hades_040_f
...then, I don't know, maybe a nap, a nice dinner. It's gonna be a full day!

TAG: Hades_030_f
Once again, I AM NOT STUCK! There's something down here I want!

TAG: Hades_015_f
My whole deal? What do you want, my resume?

TAG: Hades_031_f
I told you. I'm Hades. God of the dead, Underworld, what have you. Soon-to-be ruler of the Storybook Vale.

TAG: Hades_032_f
Seriously, what else do you wanna know? If I like long walks on the beach?

TAG: Hades_016_f
Maleficent? Hold on. Do not get me started on Maleficent!

TAG: Hades_017_f
People say I'M a control freak! I've got nothin' on Miss Mistress of All Evil over there.

TAG: Hades_018_f
It's your feud that's causing all these problems.

TAG: Hades_019_f
Okay, okay, I can see you've got an agenda. Whaddaya say we try a little trade-off here?

TAG: Hades_020_f
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

TAG: Hades_021_f
See, you help me with something, and then I'll hear you out about the whole Maleficent situation. Sound good?

TAG: Hades_006_f
So you've heard of me. Good. Saves me some time.

TAG: Hades_007_f
That's good. Because if you were...

TAG: Hades_008_f
...YOU'D BE FIRED!

TAG: Hades_009_f
Okay, okay, let's start over here.
