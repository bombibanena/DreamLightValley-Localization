Hades, you came close to burning down Remy's restaurant!

TAG: Hades_001_f
Too bad I didn't. It would've been a just end for that rathole!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think you're overreacting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Come on; it's not that bad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Wow, Vanellope really got under your skin, didn't she?

TAG: Hades_002_f
Me? Overreact? Never. I'm cool as the cucumber in frozen tzatziki.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You've got this!

Ursula can be tricky â be careful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Hope you're slick enough for her.

TAG: Hades_005_f
It's... it's this job! It's beneath me! You can't be BETTER than everyone else when you're catering to others.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Leave it to a rodent to be happy taking orders from everyone.

TAG: Hades_007_f
I refuse to put myself in a position where anyone can tell me what to do.

TAG: Hades_008_f
I got enough of that from Zeus!

TAG: Hades_009_f
Fair enough. So you're definitely a quick talker... What if you try a job that leverages that? Like a salesman of some kind?

TAG: Hades_010_f
Hmm... Yeah. And then I just talk people into buying things?

TAG: Hades_011_f
Exactly! Capitalize on your charm and persuasion!

TAG: Hades_012_f
I like it! I'll go talk to Ursula â she said she had some potions to sell. My first challenge â talk her into hiring me!

TAG: Hades_013_f
Whoa! Cool it with the cheerleader impression, would ya?

TAG: Hades_014_f
I want admirers, not groupies. There's a difference.

Now before I start, as my head minion, hence assistant, you need to look the part.

TAG: Hades_018_f
You gotta know by now that my colors are <Lore>black and blue</Lore>. And try to scrounge up something <Lore>formal</Lore> too. We're not going to a kid's birthday party here.

TAG: Hades_022_f
Now before I start, as my intermediate minion, hence assistant, you need to look the part.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Now before I start, as my associate minion, hence assistant, you need to look the part.

TAG: Hades_021_f
Now before I start, as my junior minion, hence assistant, you need to look the part.

TAG: Hades_015_f
True. I've heard she's more slippery than Poseidon, and he's never found a deal he couldn't slither out of.

TAG: Hades_016_f
Watch and learn, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Says the mortal who's never been to Bacchus's 10-star joint.

TAG: Hades_004_f
The kid? Get to ME? Not likely.
