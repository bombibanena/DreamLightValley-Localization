Ha-ha-ha-ha! Finally! I am almost back where I belong!

TAG: Hades_003_f
Mount Olympus is MINE! Without any lazy, ungrateful gods lounging around ruinin' the vibe.

You know, {PlayerName}, you played a tiny part in this. So, since I'm such a nice guy, I'm movin' you up to Head Minion.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm honored. Truly.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're not a very nice guy, Hades.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
"A tiny part"?! I did ALL the work!

TAG: Hades_006_f
What can I say?; You earned it!

TAG: Hades_007_f
Now, your first duty in your new role is to <Lore>clean up around here</Lore>.

TAG: Hades_004_f
What a mess! I haven't seen this much chaos since Cerberus chased a satyr through my office. Where's the cleaning crew when you need 'em?

TAG: Hades_005_f

TAG: Hades_011_f
I usually leave a spare key lying under a rug somewhere. <Lore>Take a look around</Lore>.

TAG: Hades_012_f
Oh, and I should mention the keys don't really look like keys; they're more like...

TAG: Hades_013_f
Wait â there I go, micromanaging again. You'll <Lore>figure it out</Lore>.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Excuse me? Find me a nicer lord of the Underworld. Seriously.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Hey now! Without my clear direction and excellent delegation, you'd be NOWHERE. Got it?

TAG: Hades_010_f
Besides, there's still a lotta work to do.
