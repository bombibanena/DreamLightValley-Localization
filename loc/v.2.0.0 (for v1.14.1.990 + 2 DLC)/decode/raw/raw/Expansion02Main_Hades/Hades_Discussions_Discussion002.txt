Oh, do I have my scheming face on? Well, I am workin' on something big. You might even say epic.

TAG: Hades_001_f
Just wonderin' if I should consult the Fates about it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Who are the Fates?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That sounds like a good idea.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What if they give you bad news?

TAG: Hades_002_f
Oh, just some old biddy know-it-alls who keep an eye on the past, present, and future.

TAG: Hades_003_f
They're good consultants if ya know how to butter 'em up.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Though they like giving advice in... ugh... verse.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That sounds like a good idea.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What if they give you bad news?

TAG: Hades_005_f
I'll have to get on their calendar, which is a headache and a half.

TAG: Hades_006_f
They know everyone who's ever gonna want an appointment with 'em.

TAG: Hades_007_f
So they schedule themselves out into the next century.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Yeah, that's the headache of talking to the Fates.

TAG: Hades_009_f
They'll give ya insider intel, but what they say happens.

TAG: Hades_010_f
So if they say a plan's doomed, that's it. You're done. Nothin' can change that fate.
