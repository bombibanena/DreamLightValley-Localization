Hey, what can I say? Sometimes you have a day and things just work out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Did something nice happen?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you do something devious?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did you have a yummy lunch?

TAG: Hades_001_f
You could say that.

TAG: Hades_004_f
I mean, it was nice for me. Not so much for the other guy.

TAG: Hades_005_f
But I'm the one who really matters, right?

TAG: Hades_002_f
Ya know, I did. Just a little primo double-dealing.

TAG: Hades_007_f
I'm not gonna say anything else, because you've got your "quest" face on.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Go fix someone else's problems, okay?

TAG: Hades_003_f
You know what? I did. Moussaka and some really fresh pita.

TAG: Hades_008_f
