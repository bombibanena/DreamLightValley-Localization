Hey, are you ready for your public address? Just want to make sure we're on the same page about Daisy's deal wâ

TAG: Hades_001_f
THE AUDACITY!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Oooh, okay then.

TAG: Hades_003_f
HOW DARE. SHE. TELL. ME. WHAT. TO. DO.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Calm down.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's usually what managers do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
And that's why I don't have a manager.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Seriously, you're not going to be a popular celebrity if you're always blowing up at people.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Okay, fine, fine, I'm calm. I'm fine.

TAG: Hades_006_f
*inhale* *exhale* Just gonna breathe for a bit... I'm good.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Feel better now?

TAG: Hades_011_f
So what did Daisy line up for you? She mentioned an endorsement deal with Goofy?

TAG: Hades_012_f
Apparently, she's lined up a presentation where I show people how to cook food using ingredients from Goofy's Stall.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Cool!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Isn't that... beneath you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That'll be new to you.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Is it? Because a cooking demo isn't really the impact I was going for... *sigh* But I suppose I'm stuck since she already advertised it.

TAG: Hades_019_f
What do you want to make for your little presentation?

TAG: Hades_020_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, haven't you figured it out yet?

TAG: Hades_021_f
You're gonna make it for me, and then I'll take all the credit.

TAG: Hades_022_f
Isn't that what celebrities do?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You've got me there.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Okay... just this once.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Fine, but I'm doing it for Daisy.

TAG: Hades_023_f
Okay. Go make me some <ActivityItem>Spanakopita</ActivityItem> and some <ActivityItem>Olympian Tapenade</ActivityItem>. I'm thinking a few classics will really rev up my fans.

TAG: Hades_024_f
After you get the Ingredients, go talk to Daisy. She's got a list a mile long, but as a celebrity, I think I deserve a little me-time, right?

TAG: Hades_015_f
Obviously!

TAG: Hades_016_f
Though, maybe if you excel at this, Daisy can get you more interesting gigs.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Hmm... yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

TAG: Hades_018_f
Hey, I may not be the god of cooking, but I can toss around some feta and olives like the best of 'em.

TAG: Hades_008_f
A decision I am woefully regretting! You get it. {PlayerName}, you're familiar with regret, right?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Only too familiar...

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Occasionally, yes.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I regret nothing.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Yeah, I thought I'd left it behind in Greece, but clearly that didn't happen...

TAG: Hades_010_f
Well, guess I should take a curl out of your scroll, huh?
