Ah, {PlayerName}! What's shakin'?

TAG: Hades_001_f
A lot, actually.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you in the mood to be helpful?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're all-knowing, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Interested in a bit of gossip?

TAG: Hades_002_f
Absolutely. You want help, I'm your guy.

TAG: Hades_005_f
What have you got for me?

TAG: Hades_009_f
Flynn Rider has been on a mission to recover his lost memories, and so far... it isn't looking too great for him.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Okay, okay. Go on...

TAG: Hades_011_f
The memories he has IMPLY he was working for Maleficent.

TAG: Hades_019_f
Ugh. Maleficent?! Why would ANYONE work with her? She's IMPOSSIBLE!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I thought that'd get your attention.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You ever tried breathing exercises?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Guess your feelings about her haven't changed.

TAG: Hades_021_f
You think? Keep talkin'.

TAG: Hades_012_f
The last thing he remembers was chasing Princess Aurora in Mythopia. We thought you might know something about this?

TAG: Hades_013_f
Sorry. Not ringing any bells.

TAG: Hades_015_f
BUT! I have this box in my House that weirdly gathers all kinds of old junk. Could be a clue in there.

TAG: Hades_016_f
You have my express permission to snoop around in that thing all you like.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Thanks, Hades. You can be a decent guy now and then.

TAG: Hades_018_f
Hey, any enemy of Maleficent is a friend of mine!

TAG: Hades_014_f
JUSTâ Whew. Look, I'm fine. I'm good. Who needs breathing? Go on.

TAG: Hades_022_f
Not one bit. Or even half a bit. I'm talkin' zilch.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Well, I wouldn't say ALL-knowing.

TAG: Hades_006_f
I mean, I know a lot, sure. What do you need to know, exactly?

TAG: Hades_004_f
Are you asking the GOD of the UNDERWORLD if he's interested in gossip?

TAG: Hades_007_f
Because yeah, obviously I am. I've been bored out of my fiery skull over here!

TAG: Hades_008_f
Tell me, and don't leave out the juicy bits.
