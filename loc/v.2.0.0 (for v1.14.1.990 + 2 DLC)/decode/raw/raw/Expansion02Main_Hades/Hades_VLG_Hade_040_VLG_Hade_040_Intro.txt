{PlayerName}, I've got it! Finally!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Have what, Hades?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh, I'm not ready for this conversation...

TAG: Hades_001_f
The way to get the attention I deserve!

TAG: Hades_002_f
I can't believe I didn't see it sooner.

TAG: Hades_003_f
What's your idea?

TAG: Hades_004_f
Okay, so I started with the obvious fact that everyone's selfish.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No they're not!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I have my doubts about that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Hey, speak for yourself.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Sheesh, {PlayerName}, I didn't realize you were that naive. You're worse than Pandora before the box.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Trust me; this plan is gonna work. Here's what we'll do...

TAG: Hades_008_f
Throw a celebration! That way, people think I'm giving THEM something.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
That doesn't sound too wild.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Everyone loves a party!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
This won't be a party to secretly steal something, will it?

TAG: Hades_009_f
Oh, it will be if you execute my plans properly.

TAG: Hades_012_f
I'm gonna throw the best party the Vale has ever seen.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Then, everyone will have no choice but to adore me!

TAG: Hades_014_f
Hades, if you want to throw a party, who am I to say no?

TAG: Hades_015_f
That's what I like to hear! Now, the first thing we need for a party is a menu.

TAG: Hades_016_f
Go <Lore>talk to Tiana</Lore>. If she caters my party, they'll be raving about the food.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Cool, I'll go chat with her now.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Exactly.

TAG: Hades_011_f
Steal? No, more like reclaim what's rightfully mine.

TAG: Hades_018_f
Hey, take it from someone who's been around kinda forever, okay?

TAG: Hades_006_f
I do! And for the dead. Which, percentage-wise, is basically everyone.
