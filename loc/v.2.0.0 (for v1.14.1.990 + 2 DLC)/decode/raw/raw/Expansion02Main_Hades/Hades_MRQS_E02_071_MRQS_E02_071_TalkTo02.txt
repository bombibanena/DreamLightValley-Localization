Heyyyy! You actually managed to do it.

TAG: Hades_001_f
Gotta hand it to ya, kid; the best I was hopin' for was that, when you inevitably failed, it would be good for a laugh.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I held up my end of the bargain. You hold up yours.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Has anybody ever told you that you're not very nice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'm pretty awesome. It's not a good idea to underestimate me.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Right, riiight. The whole Maleficent thing.

TAG: Hades_010_f
We can talk about that, sure. But first I think you oughta deal with THAT.

TAG: Hades_011_f
I noticed it not too long ago because there's some pretty funky magic coming off it.

TAG: Hades_012_f
I'm thinkin' you should try that magic of yours. See if it does anything.

TAG: Hades_004_f
All the time. But I'm tellin' ya, I'm a total gem once ya get to know me.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Is just a smidge of competence out of my minions too much to ask?

TAG: Hades_008_f
If you're such a nice guy, maybe you ought to help me, since I helped you.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Ugh. You know, you're starting to remind me of a certain Wonder Boy...

TAG: Hades_007_f
You better not start selling merch of yourself.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Look, I helped you out. Now will you help me?
