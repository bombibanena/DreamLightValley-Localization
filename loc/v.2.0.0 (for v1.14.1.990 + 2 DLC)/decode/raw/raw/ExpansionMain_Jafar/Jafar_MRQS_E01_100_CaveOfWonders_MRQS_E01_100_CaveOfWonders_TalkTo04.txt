Jafar, I'm stuck. Can you help me out?

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Very well. How may I be of assistance?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Tell me about the room on the left.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Tell me about the room on the right.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Actually, never mind; I'll do it myself.

There you will see more of the <Lore>lever and mirror structures</Lore>. If you find the proper configuration, you will <Lore>divert the light beam</Lore> out.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
In addition, there is a spot where something <Lore>used to hang on the wall</Lore> near the entrance to the room. <Lore>Return the object to its rightful place</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
Is there anything else?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yeah, lemme hear those hint options again.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Nah, I'm good.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Thanks, Jafar. I'll give it another shot.

The statue head on the right has lost its power source. Use the <Lore>charging station</Lore> within the room to obtain a fully charged <Lore>power coil</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Also, the dials on the floor tiles will let you <Lore>route the power flow to all of the charging station's connectors</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
And yet you decided to bother me anyway...
