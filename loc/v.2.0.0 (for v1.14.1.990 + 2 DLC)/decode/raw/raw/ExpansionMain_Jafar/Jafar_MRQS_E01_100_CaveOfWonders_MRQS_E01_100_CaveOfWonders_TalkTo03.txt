Jafar, I'm having trouble with this one â can you give me a hint how to progress?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Ah, but {PlayerName}, would it not be more satisfying to figure this out for yourself?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Nah, hit me with the hints.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Actually, yeah, I can do this on my own.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Well then... Do you see those cobra statues and the beams of light coming from them?

TAG: Jafar_003_f
You will progress by <Lore>connecting the beams of light to the interrupters bordering the door</Lore>.

You must find a source for its power and then pull the switch to bounce it off the mirror.

How enterprising of you.
