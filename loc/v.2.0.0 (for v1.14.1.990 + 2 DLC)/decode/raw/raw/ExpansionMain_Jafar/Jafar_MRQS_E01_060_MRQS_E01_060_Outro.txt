At last! The Royal Hourglass! Do you feel it, {PlayerName}? With that in your grasp, the fabric of time is at your command!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I don't feel any different...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
So you're saying I just got EVEN COOLER?

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Trust me. Hold it towards the broken bridge and watch as time reverses!

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Here goes nothing!

TAG: Jafar_015_f
It... didn't do anything.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Should I try again...?

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Blast! I should have known the Hourglass would not be powerful enough to turn back time in its current state!

TAG: Jafar_018_f
You see... it's <Lore>missing something</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Three <ActivityItem>Jewels of Time</ActivityItem> have been pried loose from its handle.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Long ago, when you decided the Hourglass was too powerful, you removed the Jewels and hid them.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
Luckily, I know where one of them is.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Search <Lore>down the hallway, to the right of the broken bridge</Lore>. There, you'll find what you seek.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
The way is blocked by <ActivityItem>Swirling Sands</ActivityItem>. Just another annoyance caused by the rifts in space and time here.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
But they <Lore>should be no match for your Hourglass</Lore>, even in its weakened state.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
Maybe when I get a chance, I should <Lore>check in on EVE</Lore>... She still seemed a little nervous.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
Long ago, when the Old Ruler decided the Hourglass was too powerful, they removed the Jewels and scattered them.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Ugh. Have your moment if you must, but remember: We have work to do.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Hold the Hourglass towards the broken bridge and watch as time reverses!
