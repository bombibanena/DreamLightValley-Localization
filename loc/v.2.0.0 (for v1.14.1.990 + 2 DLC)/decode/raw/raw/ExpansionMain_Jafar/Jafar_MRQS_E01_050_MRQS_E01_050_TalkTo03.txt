At last, you've arrived!

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Welcome, {PlayerName}, to Eternity Isle!

TAG: Jafar_003_f
You find yourself at <Lore>Ancient's Landing</Lore>. Don't let the scenery fool you. There are countless treasures to be found here, but it is fraught with peril.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's so amazing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What can I do to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A little danger doesn't scare me.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Yes, it is a marvel, isn't it? However, at the moment, that is irrelevant.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
We have no time to lose.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
Your first task will be to find the <ActivityItem>Ancient Gate</ActivityItem> that leads deeper into the Island. It is up those nearby stairs.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
You have no doubt noticed that the way is blocked by these <Lore>strange formations</Lore> jutting out of the ground?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They're beautiful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
They're super weird.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
They're both beautiful AND super weird.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
I have named them <ActivityItem>Splinters of Fate</ActivityItem>. They are wounds in the very fabric of time...

TAG: Jafar_009_f
But they should be no match for your <Lore>Dreamlight Magic</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Simply focus your attention on them, and they will mend.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Just like how I remove Night Thorns back in Dreamlight Valley... Got it!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
If you are ever unsure of what to do next, you may contact me at one of these devices.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
There is another one beside the <ActivityItem>Ancient Gate</ActivityItem>. Clear the way and speak to me there!

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Oh, how I appreciate that you do not prattle on with frivolous pleasantries.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Beware overconfidence, {PlayerName}. It could cost you dearly.
