Must I explain everything to you?

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Seek out the lost Jewels of Time in the Glittering Dunes and the Wild Tangle. It is the only way to save Eternity Isle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Any tips for the Wild Tangle?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Any tips for the Glittering Dunes?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I need some hints for the Cave of Wonders.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Okay, I'll keep searching.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
There's sure to be someone in those jungles who can help you.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Keep searching.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
I know you have met that Rapunzel girl. I have eyes everywhere in those jungles.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Surely she can help you. The Jewel of Time is within your grasp!

TAG: Jafar_006_f
The deserts. Well, I have left a little test for you there. Search them, but be careful not to wind up like that last fool.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Last fool...? Who are you talking about?

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Someone you are sure to find if your eyes are half open.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
I'm certain he holds the key to locating the Jewel of Time.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Ah yes, the desert... I see you've stumbled upon that fool Gaston.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
I thought the quicksand would have taken him by now. But still, he may prove useful to us yet.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
He could hold the key to finding the Jewel of Time and countless other treasures... if you can stomach his presence long enough.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Well then... Do you see those cobra statues and the beams of light coming from them?

TAG: Jafar_018_f
You will progress by <Lore>connecting the beams of light to the interrupters bordering the door</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
You must find a source for its power and then pull the switch to bounce it off the mirror.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
You will have to explore both rooms in the Cave of Wonders to proceed further.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Tell me about the room on the left.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Tell me about the room on the right.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
There you will see more of the <Lore>lever and mirror structures</Lore>. If you find the proper configuration, you will <Lore>divert the light beam</Lore> out.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
In addition, there is a spot where something <Lore>used to hang on the wall</Lore> near the entrance to the room. <Lore>Return the object to its rightful place</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
The statue head on the right has lost its power source. Use the <Lore>charging station</Lore> within the room to obtain a fully charged <Lore>power coil</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Also, the dials on the floor tiles will let you <Lore>route the power flow to all of the charging station's connectors</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_026_f
All that remains is to claim the Jewel of Time from its hidden spot.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
And please do hurry.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Time waits for no one.
