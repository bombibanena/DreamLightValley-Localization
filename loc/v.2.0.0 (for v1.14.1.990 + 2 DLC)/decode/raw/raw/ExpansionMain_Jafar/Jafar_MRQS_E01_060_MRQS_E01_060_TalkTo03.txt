Well? Did you discover anything useful inside that shiny little annoyance's home?

TAG: Player_000_f
I found a <ActivityItem>Memory</ActivityItem> of EVE and somebody dressed up as a robot. They were in some sort of hidden place, and there was a strange meal...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was so cute!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
EVE looked so happy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
If I could just recreate that Memory...

Do not become distracted by sentimentality. That Memory holds the key to getting the Hourglass.

Hmm... Never underestimate the power of a good disguise, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
You must <Lore>find that costume</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
I'm not sure where to look...

TAG: Jafar_015_f
<Lore>Locate the place you saw in the Memory</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Once you find it... <Lore>disguise yourself and return to the metal nuisance</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Then she would surely trust someone who dressed the same way as what you saw in that Memory...

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Ahh... Now that is an idea.
