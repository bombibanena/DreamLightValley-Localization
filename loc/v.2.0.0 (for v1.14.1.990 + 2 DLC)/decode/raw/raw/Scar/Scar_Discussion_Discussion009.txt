Why don't I ever see you with a wildebeest slung over your shoulder?

TAG: Scar_001_f
When, exactly, do you hunt?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I don't hunt.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's not something I can do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't like wildebeest.

TAG: Scar_002_f
You don't hunt? But then...

TAG: Scar_006_f
What do you eat?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Anything with chocolate.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sandwiches.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Salads.

TAG: Scar_007_f
I'm afraid I've no idea what that is...

TAG: Scar_009_f
But it does sound... intriguing.

TAG: Scar_008_f
What is a "sandwich"?

TAG: Scar_010_f
It's like... food, but with two pieces of bread around it.

TAG: Scar_011_f
So, if I were to put two pieces of this "bread" around a wildebeest... that would be a sandwich?

TAG: Scar_012_f
Um... that's a very philosophical question...

TAG: Scar_013_f
Salads...?

TAG: Scar_014_f
You know... some lettuce, tomatoes, maybe a little dressing...

TAG: Scar_015_f
You've just described a bowl of leaves. How wretched.

TAG: Scar_003_f
You can't hunt? How tragic.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Then zebra. Or gazelle.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Not a fan of any of those. Sorry.
