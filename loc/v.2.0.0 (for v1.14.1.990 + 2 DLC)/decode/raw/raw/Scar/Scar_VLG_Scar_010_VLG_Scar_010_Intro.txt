Oh, goody. If it isn't our illustrious ruler descending from on high to mingle with the... commoners. What brings you to my humble abode?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm here to help. Do you need anything?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Never mind. I'll come back later.

TAG: Scar_005_f
How magnanimous of you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scar_001_f
But perhaps you should start by helping yourself.

TAG: Scar_000_f
For someone who's supposed to be the ruler of this Valley, you look rather shabby. Are the tributes not what they used to be?

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
I could make myself a little more stylish...

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
You don't like my clothes...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
There's nothing wrong with me!

TAG: Scar_004_f
I would if I were you.

TAG: Scar_010_f
You lack a certain... dignity. Your coat is dull and ragged. Hardly worthy of a warthog.

TAG: Scar_012_f
If you want to rule over these lands and deal with me, the King of the Sunlit Plateau, you'll have to address that.

TAG: Player_004_f
So, I need to change my outfit to look a little more regal...

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
I'll do that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_011_f
How do I do that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_012_f
I don't know if I can pull off "regal."

TAG: Scar_011_f
I'm quivering with anticipation...

TAG: Scar_013_f
I can only assume there's someone around here responsible for making the coverings you wear on your strange, furless skin.

TAG: Scar_015_f
Have them make you a coat fit for a leader who's worthy of meeting with me.

TAG: Player_001_f
I'll ask Mother Gothel...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
She's crafty that way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'd rather make a deal with her than Ursula.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I don't think Merlin can sew.

TAG: Scar_016_f
The female from the Glade...?

TAG: Scar_019_f
Suit yourself, {PlayerName}, but be wary she doesn't claw you in the back.

TAG: Scar_017_f
I've never understood your obsession with all these deceptive schemers...

TAG: Scar_002_f
That's a little funny coming from you.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Oh, {PlayerName}. I'd never dream of deceiving you.

TAG: Scar_018_f
I've no idea what you're referring to, but I'm sure the blustering fool is incapable of it.

TAG: Scar_014_f
Oh, "regal" is far too long a stretch... but with the right improvements, you might at least reach "acceptable."

TAG: Scar_007_f
Run along then. I'm sure you have oodles of hapless Villagers in need of aid.
