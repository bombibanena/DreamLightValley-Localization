{PlayerName}, I have a little matter to discuss with you regarding my territory. Do join me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What seems to be the problem?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'll take care of this later.

TAG: Scar_000_f
Tell me, have you taken time from your "oh-so-busy" schedule to explore the Sunlit Plateau?

TAG: Scar_007_f
Wait â what am I saying? You never stray far from the safe and familiar.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Well, if you HAD bothered, you'd know that it's absolutely littered with wildebeest bones.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can't you remove them yourself?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What happened to the wildebeests...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Scar... Did you eat all the wildebeests?

TAG: Scar_008_f
If I could, I wouldn't be bothering with you. But since I can't, here we are.

TAG: Scar_003_f
It wasn't such a problem before you decided to go away. You were very good at digging out the bones and removing them...

TAG: Scar_006_f
Of course, your <ActivityItem>Royal Shovel</ActivityItem> was sharper back then.

TAG: Scar_020_f
I seem to recall it had something to do with that bombastic Scrooge McDuck. He had some manner of making your Shovel stronger.

TAG: Scar_015_f
Sounds good. I'll go talk to Mr. McDuck about making my Shovel stronger so we can clean up the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Scar_012_f
I couldn't say...

TAG: Scar_005_f
But that is not the point, {PlayerName}. The point is that most of the Plateau is unusable for me â ahem, for us.

TAG: Scar_001_f
If I were gorging myself on wildebeests, do you really think I'd need to ask that rodent to procure food for me?

TAG: Scar_016_f
There have never been wildebeests on the Sunlit Plateau... but there have always been bones.

TAG: Scar_017_f
Somehow, they simply appear from time to time.

TAG: Scar_018_f
On my honor.

TAG: Scar_019_f
Hm. That's weird... but I guess a lot of things about Dreamlight Valley are pretty weird.

TAG: Scar_002_f
*sigh* And I'll be here, awaiting your mere morsels of benevolence.
