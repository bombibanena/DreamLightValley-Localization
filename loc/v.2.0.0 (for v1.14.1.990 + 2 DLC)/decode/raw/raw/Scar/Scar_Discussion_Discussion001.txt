Life's not fair, is it? I have to contend with countless fools trying to deny me my rightful place as king...

TAG: Scar_010_f
...and you have to deal with a bumbling parade of incompetents stumbling through your Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I like the Villagers.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're just bitter.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
As you like to say, "I'm surrounded by fools."

TAG: Scar_001_f
Truly? Most of them are less inspiring than hyenas.

TAG: Scar_011_f
You do know that everyone is just here to take advantage of your talents? They're scavengers.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Not true.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm happy to share.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
At least I've got talents.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Far be it from me to intrude on your delusions.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Altruism is just another form of gullibility.

TAG: Scar_004_f
But evidently, "wit" is not among them.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Until I'm recognized as the rightful king of all I survey... I have a great deal to be bitter about.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Yes, it's our lot in life to suffer, surrounded by incompetents not worthy of us.

TAG: Scar_007_f
Perhaps you could give me control over more of the Valley. Wouldn't it be a refreshing change to work with someone... capable?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
No way.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll consider it.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Grr. Your loss.

TAG: Scar_009_f
Consider it quickly. I'm in a generous mood, but it won't last forever.
