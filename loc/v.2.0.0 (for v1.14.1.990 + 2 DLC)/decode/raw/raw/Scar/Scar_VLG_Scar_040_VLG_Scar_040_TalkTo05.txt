Grr! The curse still hasn't been lifted... and my prized trinket is nowhere to be found.

TAG: Scar_008_f
This was all for nothing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sorry, Scar...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We can try something else.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We still had fun scheming together.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Oh, you're a true bleeding heart, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Though, I must admit that you've stuck by my side more than I expected. I suppose, if there's anyone I could call... a friend...

TAG: Scar_001_f
...well... it would have to be you.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Wait... What's happening...?

TAG: Scar_009_f
Scar, I think the enchantment is breaking. Look over there!

TAG: Scar_003_f
Why bother? It wouldn't change anything...

TAG: Scar_007_f
Did we?

TAG: Scar_004_f
Oh, fine. I suppose it wasn't entirely unpleasant.
