You again? Oh goody.

TAG: Scar_001_f
What's this? Another <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Badge</ActivityItem>? Why would you bring me this, {PlayerName}? I've no desire to start a collection.

TAG: Player_000_f
Buzz and I would like you to join our new Space Ranger Academy here in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You know. Since you and Buzz are already such good friends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I thought you'd like to be invited.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
To get you out of your cave a little.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Ugh! For the last time, I merely tolerated that puny nuisance because he's inedible.

TAG: Scar_007_f
Why would you possibly want me in your little Academy?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I trust there's good in you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Everyone should have a second chance.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We need someone a little ruthless.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Oh, how hospitable of you.

TAG: Scar_011_f
Look, if you won't do it to help others, do it to help yourself.

TAG: Scar_006_f
You'll earn the respect you deserve from the other Villagers... and there'll be a lot of food on offer.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Well, when you put it that way... Fine, {PlayerName}. I'll join your little club...

TAG: Scar_009_f
Which presumes I've done something wrong.

TAG: Scar_010_f
Now there's an interesting thought.

TAG: Scar_012_f
But why should I help you?

TAG: Scar_003_f
I have no idea how you came to that conclusion...

TAG: Scar_004_f
Oh, I get out often enough. I patrol my territory, make sure no enemies threaten my Sunlit Plateau...
