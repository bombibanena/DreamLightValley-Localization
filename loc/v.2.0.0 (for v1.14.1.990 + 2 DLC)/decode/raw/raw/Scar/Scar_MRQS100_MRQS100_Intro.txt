TAG: Scar_005_f
Well, well. If it isn't {PlayerName}. It's been far too long since you came 'round to visit.

TAG: Scar_006_f
I was beginning to think you'd leave me trapped in here forever.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Scar?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do we know each other?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're so cute! Can I scratch you behind the ear?

TAG: Scar_007_f
Ah, so you do remember me.

TAG: Scar_013_f
Before the Forgetting, you were one of my most loyal assistants...

TAG: Scar_015_f
...when *I* ruled over this entire Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Huh? Really?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I doubt it...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're exaggerating, Scar.

TAG: Scar_016_f
Absolutely. Why, I may have let you watch over the rest of the Village...

TAG: Scar_057_f
Yes. This all began when YOU abandoned the Valley.

TAG: Scar_023_f
Though perhaps, with my guidance, you could set it all right...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Why should I help you?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Why did the Pillar dry out?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Just tell me what I need to do.

TAG: Scar_017_f
...but when it comes to the Sunlit Plateau, everyone knows that I'M the rightful king.

TAG: Scar_019_f
Of course, there's little worth ruling over here since <Lore>the river dried up</Lore>.

TAG: Scar_059_f
What happened to the river?

TAG: Scar_020_f
I can only presume that something's blocking it. And the land has grown so parched that there's no prey.

TAG: Scar_046_f
Without water, there's no life. <Lore>The power within the Pillar of Nurturing has died out.</Lore>

TAG: Scar_050_f
And now there's all sorts of pesky dark power in the air. If someone doesn't fix this soon, the whole Plateau will become an arid wasteland.

TAG: Scar_055_f
And the most tragic part is... it's all your fault.

TAG: Scar_056_f
My fault?! What?

TAG: Scar_022_f
Because it's your place in the food chain. The Valley was a far better place when I ruled it, with you at my side.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Hm. I could always use more help around here.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Uh... I have trouble believing that.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
You're not the king of Dreamlight Valley, Scar!!!

TAG: Scar_024_f
You see? It's a fine arrangement. A quid pro quo, as it were.

TAG: Scar_030_f
Of course, if you're still not convinced...

TAG: Scar_027_f
...then don't do it for me. Do it to help the Village. Restoring the Sunlit Plateau will make life so much better for everyone.

TAG: Scar_039_f
Isn't that what a good ruler ought to do, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Scar_025_f
Trust me, {PlayerName}, and I promise: All will be as it should.

TAG: Scar_026_f
Perhaps not... yet.

TAG: Scar_031_f
You're not exactly making me want to help you.

TAG: Scar_032_f
Well, if that's the case...

TAG: Scar_028_f
Because it's connected to the river that runs through the Plateau.

TAG: Scar_033_f
Without water, the Pillar has utterly broken.

TAG: Scar_034_f
And it seems to be connected to all the life on the Plateau. When one flourishes, so does the other. But when one is broken...

TAG: Scar_035_f
Huh. So they're connected to each other... feeding off each other, in a balance... almost like some sort of...

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
...Circle of Life?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
...oval of biological existence?

TAG: Scar_036_f
Ugh. Yes. But don't ever say that phrase in my presence again.

TAG: Scar_037_f
All the annoyance started when something blocked the river.

TAG: Scar_040_f
I've no idea what that could be, but I do know that it began at the same time as the Forgetting.

TAG: Scar_045_f
And not long after, those blasted rocks fell on my lair. I've been trapped in here ever since.

TAG: Scar_058_f
Now, wasn't that also when you abandoned the Village...?

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
None of this is my fault!

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause this.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
Hey, do you want my help or not?

TAG: Scar_002_f
Oh, {PlayerName}. Everyone knows it is.

TAG: Scar_021_f
But if you fix all this... it might make up for the trouble you've caused.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Oh, I know you didn't, {PlayerName}. It seems disaster just naturally follows you.

TAG: Scar_004_f
I'll help you... but you need to stop trying to manipulate me.

TAG: Scar_042_f
Ugh. You used to be so much more... persuadable.

TAG: Scar_038_f
Not exactly a poet, are you? But that's the idea.

TAG: Scar_029_f
*sigh* Must I do everything myself...? Find out what's blocking the river.

TAG: Scar_041_f
The water flows from the depths of the <Lore>Vitalys Mines</Lore> beneath the cliffs on the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Scar_047_f
There are mines beneath cliffs...? What did they mine in there?

TAG: Scar_048_f
I haven't the faintest idea, as it was nothing of value to me.

TAG: Scar_049_f
Search the mines until you find what's blocking the flow of the river.

TAG: Scar_053_f
And then â and don't forget this partâ

TAG: Scar_054_f
Fix it.

TAG: Scar_052_f
Only then will you restore life to my kingdom... and earn your way back into my good graces.

TAG: Scar_018_f
Oh, fine. If you insist... you ruled over the rest of the Village...

TAG: Scar_008_f
... Oh, you really don't remember, do you?

TAG: Scar_009_f
You could try...

TAG: Scar_010_f
...if you'd like to become acquainted with my claws.

TAG: Scar_011_f
Uh... no thanks.

TAG: Scar_012_f
Don't mistake my conviviality for Ã©galitÃ©.

TAG: Scar_014_f
In fact, quite the contrary...
