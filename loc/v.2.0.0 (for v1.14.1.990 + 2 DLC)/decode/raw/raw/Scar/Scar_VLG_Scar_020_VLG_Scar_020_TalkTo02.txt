You're back. Does that mean that I'm finally free to roam the full expanse of my kingdomâ

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'll get all of this.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Where can I find <ActivityItem>Lion's Claws</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Let's use your claws. Don't move. This is going to sting a little.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Ahem. I mean... your Valley, of course.

TAG: Scar_013_f
Or do you have more tedious questions?

TAG: Scar_006_f
I hit a little bump in the road. I have the <ActivityItem>Mold</ActivityItem>, but I don't know what to do with it...

TAG: Scar_009_f
Agh! I'm surrounded by fools!

TAG: Scar_007_f
Do my paws look like they're made for such things?!

TAG: Scar_010_f
*sigh* Though I do remember something...

TAG: Scar_011_f
Back before the Forgetting, you used to gather <ActivityItem>Dry Wood</ActivityItem> and craft things you called <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Scar_012_f
Oh and of course, there's the little matter of the <ActivityItem>Lion's Claws</ActivityItem> that you added to the mixture...

TAG: Scar_000_f
I do applaud your eagerness to help. Running around like a cub...

TAG: Scar_004_f
Before you abandoned us and everyone had to flee back to their Realms, some lions used to roam the Plateau and climb the cliffs.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Occasionally, we'd break our claws on the rocks. You'll have to search near the cliffs on the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Ha-ha. How amusing. My sides are splitting. No, I'm afraid you'll have to find the <ActivityItem>Lion's Claws</ActivityItem> elsewhere.
