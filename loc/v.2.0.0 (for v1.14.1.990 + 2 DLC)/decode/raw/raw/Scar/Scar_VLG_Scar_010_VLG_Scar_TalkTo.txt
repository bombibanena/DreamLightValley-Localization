Now, see? That wasn't SO difficult, was it? Even a warthog could have done it.

TAG: Scar_002_f
I suppose I should tell you the reason for my foul mood. It's simple...

TAG: Scar_017_f
I'm famished. There's scarcely any prey for me to eat in this Village.

TAG: Scar_016_f
Of course, I did see one of your plump, feathery neighbors about...

TAG: Scar_001_f
But I presume you'd mind if I feasted on one of them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes! I'd mind a lot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Scar. They're friends, not food.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't think they'd taste very good...

TAG: Scar_003_f
Well, I mind starving, {PlayerName}. A solution must be found â quickly!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sure we'll find something.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You could eat fish. Cats love fish.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What about plants?

TAG: Scar_012_f
For the sake of your Villagers, you'd better.

TAG: Scar_013_f
Okay, okay. I think Remy's our best bet.

TAG: Scar_006_f
The rat? That's barely an appetizer, but if I've no choiceâ

TAG: Scar_011_f
No, no. I meant we could get Remy to help make you some food!

TAG: Scar_009_f
Ugh. I remember the nauseating meals he made back before the Forgetting.

TAG: Scar_010_f
I hope, for his sake, he's improved. I'm not above eating a rodent if I have to.

TAG: Scar_018_f
I'll go talk to Remy. You just stay here and... don't eat anybody.

TAG: Scar_007_f
Perhaps your little kitty cats do, but I would need a fish meal fit for a lion! I'm famished.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Oh, you can't be serious. I'm already famished. Wasting away. Grass and leaves are no nourishment for a lion.

TAG: Scar_004_f
If you insist. But I must have something to eat.

TAG: Scar_005_f
I imagine you're right... but still, I do need something to eat.
