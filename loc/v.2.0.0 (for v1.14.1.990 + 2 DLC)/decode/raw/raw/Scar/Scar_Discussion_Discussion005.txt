I have a little thought exercise for you.

TAG: Scar_001_f
Which Villager do you think would be the most delicious?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Bad kitty!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This isn't a fun thought exercise!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
YOU CAN'T EAT THE OTHER VILLAGERS.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Oh, don't overreact, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scar_006_f
I haven't done anything wrong.

TAG: Scar_003_f
This is all strictly hypothetical, of course.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Though it does feel as if my diet has been strictly hypothetical lately.

TAG: Scar_007_f
You put so many limitations on who... ahem... WHAT I'm allowed to eat.

TAG: Scar_008_f
I'm practically skin and bones.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How about some delicious vegetable snacks?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You look fine to me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Go catch some fish.

TAG: Scar_009_f
... I'm a carnivore, you ingrate.

TAG: Scar_011_f
And all the fish in your waters aren't going to change that.

TAG: Scar_010_f
Well, I'm not. I'm famished!

TAG: Scar_012_f
Ugh. That sounds like work.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Ugh, I'm excruciatingly aware.
