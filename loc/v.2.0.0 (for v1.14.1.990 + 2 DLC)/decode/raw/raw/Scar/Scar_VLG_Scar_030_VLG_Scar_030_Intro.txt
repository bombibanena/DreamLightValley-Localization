Ah, {PlayerName}, there you are. If you're still interested in helping me get my... ahem, OUR whole territory back... I've found a solution.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I have time right now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Well then, not long ago, you removed some of the wildebeest bones littering the Plateau.

TAG: Scar_009_f
But you only managed to get rid of the smallest of them, which was of very little help. Now, I've come up with the key to removing ALL of them.

You'll have to speak with that female from the Glade of Trust.

TAG: Scar_010_f
Mother Gothel? Why?

TAG: Scar_011_f
She knows something. She used to be able to pass through the bones, back before the Forgetting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'll go ask her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
What happened between you two?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
You're only mentioning this now?

TAG: Scar_003_f
And I'll be waiting here... with great anticipation.

TAG: Scar_004_f
She refuses to speak to me because of one regrettable mistake.

TAG: Scar_007_f
You'd think it was the first time she was stalked by a lion...

TAG: Scar_005_f
Well, forgive me for not keeping track of her comings and goings.

TAG: Scar_012_f
My nap times are far too precious for such constant vigilance.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Well, you know where your answers lie now, {PlayerName}. Do what you decide is best in your INFINITE wisdom.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Oh, of course. I'm sure you have far, far better things to do.
