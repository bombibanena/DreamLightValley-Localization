You're staring at my scar, aren't you? Want to know how I got it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Scar_001_f
Oh, there are many dangers that can leave a mark.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Let's play a game. Guess how I got my scar.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Cobra.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Cape Buffalo.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Mufasa.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Hmm... Imagine... while I slept, a cobra curled up near me for warmth.

TAG: Scar_005_f
And when I woke, I startled it. It struck out, catching me near my eye.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Perhaps. But I'll never say. It's far too private a memory.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Oh yes, they are dangerous. I may have made a careless mistake crossing the savanna...

TAG: Scar_009_f
...and a startled buffalo tore at my face with her horns.

TAG: Scar_004_f
You think my brother Mufasa gave me this scar? An accident while we were cubs?

TAG: Scar_010_f
Or not such an accident when he became king?

TAG: Scar_007_f
Well, if you aren't curious, then stop staring!
