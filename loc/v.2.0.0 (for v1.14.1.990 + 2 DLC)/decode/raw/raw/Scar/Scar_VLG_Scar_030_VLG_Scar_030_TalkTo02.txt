A pile of <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem>, {PlayerName}? Don't tell me she's trying to frighten me with these?

TAG: Scar_001_f
Mother Gothel says I need to turn these to <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> and then... she said a bunch of stuff about the Circle of Life.

TAG: Scar_002_f
She also said that you tried to turn her into a three-course meal once.

TAG: Scar_015_f
Oh, THAT again? Bah! I wasn't hunting her...

TAG: Scar_009_f
I was merely patrolling the Sunlit Plateau to ensure the safety of the whole Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I believe you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Come on, Scar. I'm not buying this.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Oh, goody. Then you'll believe what I have to say next.

TAG: Scar_028_f
Yes, well, I may have a solution.

TAG: Scar_029_f
There's a <Lore>Volcanic Geyser</Lore> inside my cave. Put the bones in there. The heat and pressure should do the trick.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Then I suppose you'll just have to gather the <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> and bury them.

TAG: Scar_008_f
That's all? Sounds pretty simple.

TAG: Scar_031_f
Don't forget to water the <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem>, or it will never grow.

TAG: Scar_016_f
I saw her burying something in the ground before scurrying away. Naturally, I was worried for the safety of the Village so I decided to investigate.

TAG: Scar_017_f
A mysterious <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem> grew where I'd seen her digging. It wasn't long before she came back, so I pounced!

TAG: Scar_018_f
She was planting a flower? That's strange.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Yes, and she was looking through some item she'd pilfered from that windbag with the pointy blue head feather.

TAG: Scar_025_f
She buried the <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> from <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem>... and a <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem> grew there.

TAG: Scar_026_f
This is what she meant by the Circle of Life! The <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem> grew into a <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem>... literally.

TAG: Scar_027_f
Oh dear. You're starting to babble like my brother's unhinged mandrill...

TAG: Scar_007_f
We've only got one problem. How do we turn these bones to ash?

TAG: Scar_005_f
But it's the truth. I swear.
