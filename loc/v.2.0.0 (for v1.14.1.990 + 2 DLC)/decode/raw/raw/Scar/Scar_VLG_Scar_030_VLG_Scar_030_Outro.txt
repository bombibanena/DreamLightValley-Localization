Finally! The Sunlit Plateau is whole again!

TAG: Scar_001_f
I suppose I should thank you, {PlayerName}... You were helpful after all.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Now, there's one last thing I need to make my kingdom whole again.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll do whatever I can to help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You better be doing all this for the good of the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're not plotting against me, are you?

TAG: Scar_010_f
I'll let you know when I'm in need of your aid again.

TAG: Scar_011_f
Oh yes. I only wish to lead us all into a great and glorious future.

TAG: Scar_012_f
If I were, it wouldn't be very smart to tell you about it, now would it?

TAG: Scar_013_f
But no, {PlayerName}, I'm not planning anything against you. I'm just looking for something.
