I am surrounded by useless ingrates.

Oh, pish-tosh! Scar, you sleep eighteen hours a day.

TAG: Scar_002_f
And you spend the other six hours disparaging other Villagers.

If anyone here is an "ingrate," it is most certainly you.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Terribly sorry. You're not a useless ingrate.

TAG: Scar_005_f
You're a pompous windbag.

TAG: Scar_006_f
I don't know how I made such a grievous error.

TAG: Scar_007_f
Careful, Scar. I can always turn you into an adorable little rabbit for the children to cuddle.
