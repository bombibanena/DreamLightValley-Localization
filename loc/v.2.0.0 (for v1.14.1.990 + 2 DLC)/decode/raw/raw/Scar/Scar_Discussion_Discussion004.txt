I should have always been King of Pride Rock, not my brother. And certainly not my fool of a nephew.

I had the lion's share of intelligence, and that's far more important in a leader than brute strength.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're ill-suited.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Get over it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe you're right.

TAG: Scar_001_f
Ill-suited? Bite your tongue! Name one thing that Simba has that would make him a better king than me!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Kindness.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Respect.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Friends.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Kindness? That's just another word for weakness. Kings need to be strong! And ruthless.

TAG: Scar_005_f
I respect creatures that deserve my respect.

TAG: Scar_008_f
But I've met so very few of those.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Ugh, you mean the meerkat and the warthog? If they're what passes for friends these days, I far prefer solitude.

TAG: Scar_002_f
You're suggesting I should just "get over" being passed over for power?

TAG: Scar_009_f
Being denied my rightful place in favor of a scrawny little cub? You have no idea what you're talking about.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Finally! Someone who sees me for all that I am! I should have been king. I SHOULD be king.
