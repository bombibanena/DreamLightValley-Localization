Have you ever heard of Auguste Gusteau?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Isn't he dead?

TAG: Remy_001_f
Of course you have! He was possibly the greatest chef ever.

TAG: Remy_004_f
I learned so much from him. About good food, savoring everything, and being brave.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Good food?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Savoring everything?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Being brave?

TAG: Remy_005_f
Yes! He used to say: "Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell!"

TAG: Remy_006_f
Eating is a full body experience. You have to engage all the senses!

TAG: Remy_008_f
Yes! He used to say, "There is excellence all around you! You need only be aware to stop and savor it."

TAG: Remy_009_f
So I always try to stop and savor everything.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Yes! You have to be brave to be a great cook. You've got to try things that may not work, be willing to fail.

TAG: Remy_011_f
"Anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great."

TAG: Remy_012_f
At least, that's what Gusteau said.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Well, Gusteau is an amazing chef! And my idol.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Well, yeah, he is. But while he was alive, he was an amazing chef.
