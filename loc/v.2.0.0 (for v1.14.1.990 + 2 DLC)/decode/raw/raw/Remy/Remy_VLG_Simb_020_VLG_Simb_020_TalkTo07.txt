Ah, {PlayerName}. So, what plan are you cooking up today?

TAG: Player_000_f
Simba wants to throw a gathering, and I want to bring him some food. I want something...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...easy to eat.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...perfect for a large group.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...that screams "FUN."

TAG: Remy_003_f
Right... like finger foods, or paw foods...

TAG: Remy_014_f
Maybe you can figure out the last Ingredient?

TAG: Remy_006_f
Oh, I've got it! A <ActivityItem>Large Seafood Platter</ActivityItem> would be perfect!

TAG: Remy_010_f
Here, take the recipe in case you still don't know how to prepare it.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Thanks, Remy!

TAG: Remy_007_f
And for dessert, nothing beats a monumental <ActivityItem>Cake</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Remy_008_f
I used to make one that would've been great, but...

TAG: Remy_012_f
I haven't located the recipe for it yet.

TAG: Remy_013_f
I remember it called for <ActivityItem>Eggs</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>,<lw><ActivityItem>Fruit</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem> and something sweet.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Okay, so we need a huge plate full of food that even a lion can eat...

TAG: Remy_005_f
Hmm... So we need something exciting, but something that even a lion can eat. That's a tough one...
