Do you know how many different kinds of cooks there are?

TAG: Remy_001_f
You've got sous chefs, sauciers, pastry chefs... The list goes on!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's a sous chef?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's a saucier?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do pastry chefs only make pastries?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Oh, a sous chef is very important! They're responsible for the kitchen when the chef's not around.

TAG: Remy_005_f
A sous chef has to know how everything works.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That sounds hard.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I bet I could do that.

TAG: Remy_006_f
It is, so you need someone who's extremely qualified.

TAG: Remy_008_f
When you were in Paris, you were my sous chef!

TAG: Remy_007_f
You've already done it!

TAG: Remy_003_f
Just what it sounds like! They're a chef who's entirely in charge of sauces.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I love sauces!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That doesn't sound very important.

TAG: Remy_009_f
You should!

TAG: Remy_011_f
A good sauce can make or break a dish.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Oh, but it is! Sauces can add a finishing touch, or infuse an entire dish with flavor.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Yes. But there's no such thing as "only" a pastry. Pastries are very important.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Dessert is a customer's final experience with the restaurant.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
A last chance to make a good impression.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I love dessert.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Exactly. You get it.

TAG: Remy_014_f
You and most of Paris! Which is why pastry chefs are so important.
