{PlayerName}, did you know that when it comes to fresh ingredients, Chez Remy is the first Goofy-to-table restaurant?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Goofy-to-table...?

TAG: Remy_003_f
Yep! Goofy's Stall provides me with all the freshest ingredients.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Of course, I have to import some rare items through Mr. McDuck.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Which can be a bit expensive...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's worth it for quality ingredients.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe you could work out a better deal with Mr. McDuck?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Running a restaurant seems complicated.

TAG: Remy_007_f
You're right! Of course.

TAG: Remy_011_f
The price is worth it to create a world-class culinary experience.

TAG: Remy_008_f
But I'm just a restaurateur. What I know is food and the people who eat it.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Mr. McDuck's a world-class businessman. He'll start telling me about tariffs and import fees and supply chain issues...

TAG: Remy_010_f
I bet if I tried to cut a better deal with him, I'd just end up paying twice as much!

TAG: Remy_012_f
It is. But at the end of the day, it's also simple.

TAG: Remy_013_f
You either make a meal that someone loves... or you don't.

TAG: Remy_014_f
The rest of it doesn't matter.
