Hey, {PlayerName}! What can I do for you today? Got a special order?

TAG: Player_000_f
Buzz and I would like to recruit you for our new Star Command Academy...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think it'll be good for you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Think of all the recipes you could come up with.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You really need a new hobby.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Well, I appreciate that you're looking out for me.

TAG: Remy_001_f
But... aren't the Space Rangers... big, tall heroes? Not sure if I'm exactly Star Command material.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Heroism comes in small packages, too.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's never stopped you from doing anything.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Height isn't what's important.

TAG: Remy_002_f
You think so?

TAG: Remy_005_f
That's pretty inspiring.

TAG: Remy_009_f
I have been thinking about getting involved in some Village activities lately. This opportunity is too good to pass on. Sign me up!

TAG: Remy_003_f
Not even becoming a top chef in Paris. You're right.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Sure, YOU can say that. But I'm telling ya, it makes life a lot easier if you can reach the top of the shelves, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Remy_011_f
But I get your point, and you're right.

TAG: Remy_007_f
True... I could create a new dessert for every meeting. Talk about a challenge!

TAG: Remy_008_f
Hey! I work this much because I'm passionate about my craft, which also happens to be my favorite hobby.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Though I suppose it is a research opportunity... Hey! I could bring a whole new depth of flavor to a soldier's ready-to-eat meals!
