{PlayerName}, question for you â when you're cooking, do you prefer to experiment or follow a recipe?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Experiment!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Follow the recipe.

I just hope for the best and try not to burn anything...

I love that! You'll never find new flavors if you're not willing to combine things in unexpected ways.

Of course, don't be afraid to follow a recipe sometimes. Making a meal exactly to specifications is an art form in itself.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Very smart. Making a perfect meal exactly to specifications is an art form.

But don't be afraid to get messy, play around, and experiment.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Combine ingredients in unexpected ways and see what happens.

Hey, don't sell yourself short!

You're a great cook. Just keep combining things together and you'll find new recipes.
