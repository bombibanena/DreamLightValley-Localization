Hey, {PlayerName}, what have you got there?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Wait â are those <ActivityItem>Coffee Beans</ActivityItem>?!

TAG: Remy_012_f
Stitch and WALLÂ·E helped me grow a new tree full of them.

TAG: Remy_017_f
They'll be growing all over the Village soon.

TAG: Remy_013_f
That... is... amazing!

TAG: Remy_014_f
I can add so much to my menu!

TAG: Remy_018_f
I'm wondering what I should make first.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe something nice and frothy that you can have with cake?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe something with chocolate in it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I just need something simple to help Stitch.

TAG: Remy_005_f
I've got just the thing.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Throw a dash of <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem> in with the beans, froth to perfection...

TAG: Remy_008_f
And my friend, you will have a <ActivityItem>Latte</ActivityItem> in no time.

TAG: Remy_015_f
That's a good idea. But I'm not sure it's quite right.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Well, if you throw these beans together with a little bit of <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>... and some <ActivityItem>Chocolate</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Remy_009_f
You'll have a delicious <ActivityItem>Mocha</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Sounds amazing. But I think I need something different.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Well, simple is the way to go with high-quality beans like this.

TAG: Remy_004_f
You can prepare them like you would any other meal.

TAG: Remy_010_f
But make sure NOT to give it to Stitch before bedtime!

TAG: Remy_011_f
And one cup a day is probably enough. With Stitch, there's such a thing as TOO much energy.
