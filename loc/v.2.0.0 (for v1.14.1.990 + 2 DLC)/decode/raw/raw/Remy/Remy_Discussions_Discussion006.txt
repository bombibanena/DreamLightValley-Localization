Hey, {PlayerName}. I've been thinking...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What about?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A dangerous pastime.

TAG: Remy_001_f
About cooking. Of course, I'm always doing that...

TAG: Remy_003_f
But this time I was thinking about the Night Thorns and how we need to get rid of them.

TAG: Remy_004_f
So... what if I found a way to cook them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I think they're poisonous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
I think they're mystically dangerous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I think they'd taste bad.

TAG: Remy_005_f
You can cook some poisonous things in a way that makes them safe to eat. But I guess that would be too dangerous to try. I better give it some more thought.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Mystical, huh? That sounds a little beyond me. Guess I better not mess with the Night Thorns.

TAG: Remy_007_f
You'd be surprised at how bad some raw ingredients can taste. But sautÃ© them, add a little garlic, and they can totally transform.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Yeah. That's what my brother always says.
