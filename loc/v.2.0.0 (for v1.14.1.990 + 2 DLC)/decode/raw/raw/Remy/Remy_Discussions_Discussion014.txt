I was just talking to Merlin about this. Being a chef is a bit like... magic. You can bring all those old memories back for people.

I bet you can think of lots of smells that would be like stepping through a portal in time.

Buttered popcorn...

Baked cookies...

Old gym socks...

Mmmm! That smell must bring you right back to going to a cinema as a little kid...

...or being curled up on a couch watching a movie. Those are some pretty special memories.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Ah, I can smell it now...

TAG: Remy_007_f
Nothing beats the scent of baked cookies wafting from a kitchen to make you feel safe and taken care of.
