Is there an organization that inspects food safety in the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I don't think so.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can do that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why would you want that?

TAG: Remy_001_f
Well, we need one. I want people to know it's safe to eat at my restaurant.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Actually, you've cooked with me. Maybe you could give the restaurant a safety rating?

TAG: Remy_006_f
How would you rate my restaurant on safety?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Extremely safe.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Pretty safe.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Unsafe, but only when villains eat there.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Excellent!

TAG: Remy_009_f
I was certain everything was up to code, but it's nice to have the reassurance.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Oh. That's a good point. Maybe I should put up rules for villains?

TAG: Remy_010_f
But they're villains, so they'll just break the rules...

TAG: Remy_011_f
I need to think about this.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Great! All right. I'm ready. Go ahead.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Because I want my restaurant to be certified "safe."

TAG: Remy_004_f
I want people to feel confident eating there.
