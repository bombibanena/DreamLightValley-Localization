Oh uh, hello, "human I don't know."

TAG: Remy_001_f
I'm Remy and... you look like you're listening to me! Wait! You understand me?!

TAG: Player_000_f
Of course! I can understand everyone here. I'm {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But you don't usually see rats in the kitchen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm a huge fan!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But I've never spoken to a rat before.

TAG: Remy_002_f
True. But I happen to be the CHEF of this restaurant.

TAG: Remy_013_f
And before you ask, we pass ALL of our health inspections.

TAG: Remy_028_f
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

TAG: Remy_029_f
I know. I know. It's fine. Anyway, no time to talk.

TAG: Remy_004_f
The dining room's filling up, and most of my staff's out sick.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Plus, there's a food critic visiting tonight! And I've gotta make a good impression...

TAG: Remy_015_f
If he gives our food a bad review, it'll be a disaster!

TAG: Player_001_choice_012_f
Ugh. Critics are the worst!

TAG: Player_001_choice_013_f
He's just doing his job.

TAG: Player_001_choice_014_f
Can I help?

TAG: Remy_025_f
Some, sure. But every now and then you find one who really gets food, and that can change your life!

TAG: Remy_006_f
Have YOU ever worked in a kitchen before?

TAG: Player_001_choice_009_f
I'm a master chef!

TAG: Player_001_choice_010_f
I'm an okay chef.

TAG: Player_001_choice_011_f
Can't even make burnt toast!

TAG: Remy_020_f
Okay, good to know. But...

TAG: Remy_021_f
Right now, I need you to wash dishes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Sure, I'll wash them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
Ever heard of a dishwasher?

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
Dirty dishes. Ew.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Thank you! And please hurry. I need them quickly!

TAG: Remy_008_f
Yes, and ours is broken. The repair person will be here tomorrow.

TAG: Remy_018_f
But for now, it's a sink, water, soap and elbow grease.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Oh, please. "Ew" is growing up in a family that gets its food from the garbage.

TAG: Remy_019_f
Besides, you can't cook without clean dishes. So... wash them. Please?

TAG: Remy_022_f
Well, luckily, I don't need you to do anything too fancy... yet.

TAG: Remy_023_f
Hey, anyone can cook! Stick with me, and I'll teach you the basics.

TAG: Remy_024_f
But there's something we have to do first before we cook.

TAG: Remy_027_f
Of course. Of course.

TAG: Remy_026_f
Can you help?! Of course!

TAG: Remy_011_f
You are? You mean you've heard of my restaurant, <ActivityItem>La Ratatouille</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Remy_014_f
Ha! Silly me. Of course you have! You're here. That's great!

TAG: Remy_030_f
Sorry to cut this chit-chat short, but I gotta get moving.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Hey, we're just like humans. Well... not all of us, and not all humans. Let's just say, I'm kind of a unique rat.
