So, it turns out that running a restaurant is a lot different than cooking.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It is?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That makes sense.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Aren't they the same thing?

When you're cooking, you can focus on just the food. But a restaurant... is an entire experience! You have to decorate the space...

...manage the customers, order supplies, shop for ingredients... It's a lot of work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Do you need help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Is it worth it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Maybe you should take a break.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Actually, I'm okay. You already help me a lot, {PlayerName}. And I really appreciate it.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Having my own restaurant lets people experience my cooking. And watching them enjoy my food... there's nothing like it.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Absolutely! It's completely worth it.

TAG: Remy_005_f
No way! I love the work.
