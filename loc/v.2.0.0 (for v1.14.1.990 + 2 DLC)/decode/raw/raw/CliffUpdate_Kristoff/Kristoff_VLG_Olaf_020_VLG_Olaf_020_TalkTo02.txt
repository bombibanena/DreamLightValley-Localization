You want me to tell you about my adventures with Donald Duck when the Forgetting happened?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Uh... well, it really wasn't much of an adventure.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
We camped out on the Sunlit Plateau for a while until the Giant Night Thorns started to creep up everywhere.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Then Donald saw something that got him really mad, and he tried to fight it.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Right! The huge dragon he told me about!

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Dragon?! Not exactly. He just saw a shadow and thought it was a dragon.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
It was a hummingbird.

TAG: Player_000_f
Donald got in a fight with a hummingbird?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's not very heroic...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hummingbirds can be pretty scary.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What happened next?

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Like I told you, it wasn't much of an adventure. We just kind of... hung around.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
After that, we went to the Forgotten Lands.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
That's where the ground opened up and a giant sea monster grabbed Donald, right?

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
Uh... no. Donald stepped in a puddle and splashed water everywhere. Then a frog jumped out at us.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Definitely a frog...? Not a cool monster?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Yeesh...

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
Sorry, {PlayerName}. I wish I had something more exciting to tell you.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
After that, we went to the Forest of Valor, and... well, you know the rest.

TAG: Kristoff_013_f
I'm guessing Donald's version of the story sounded a lot more dramatic.

TAG: Kristoff_014_f
But you should talk to Donald. I bet he'll make it sound a lot more heroic than I just did.

TAG: Kristoff_015_f
Donald stepped in a puddle and splashed water everywhere. Then a frog jumped out at us.

TAG: Kristoff_016_f
Guess I haven't met the right kind of hummingbirds. Anyway, like I said, it really wasn't much of an adventure.

TAG: Kristoff_017_f
It was just a shadow, but he thought it was a dragon.
