So, {PlayerName}, what did you find?

TAG: Maui_004_f
Maybe the other half of the <ActivityItem>Heart of Dreamlight Valley</ActivityItem> is there somewhere.

TAG: Maui_009_f
Keep that first half for now!

TAG: Maui_005_f
It was a shard covered in lime. Look.

TAG: Maui_006_f
A <ActivityItem>Shard</ActivityItem>? Hmm... Okay, something's coming back to me...

TAG: Maui_007_f
Yes! This lost island was where the Ruler created the <ActivityItem>Heart of Dreamlight Valley</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Maui_000_f
They made it to protect the Castle and the Valley from curses... or at least make them less curse-y!

TAG: Maui_008_f
The <ActivityItem>Heart of Dreamlight Valley</ActivityItem> used to be in the hand of the statue on the top floor of the Castle...

TAG: Maui_001_f
It must've broken during the Forgetting! And this part of it fell to the bottom of the sea.

TAG: Maui_003_f
We should go check out the Fountain at the top of the Castle.
