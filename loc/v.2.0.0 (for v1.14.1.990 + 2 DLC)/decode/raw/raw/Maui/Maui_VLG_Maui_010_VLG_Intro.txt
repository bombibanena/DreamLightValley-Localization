Ah! Just the person I wanted to see.

So far, this Village is fine, but you know what it doesn't have? <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Maui_002_f
It would ALREADY have them if I created Dreamlight Valley. I didn't. But lucky for you, I can create <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem> now!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Uh... thanks?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Thanks... but I'm busy right now.

TAG: Maui_003_f
YOU'RE WELCOME! See? Things are already looking up!

TAG: Maui_005_f
So, first, I need an eel. My fishing friend, Goofy, can help you catch some.

TAG: Maui_006_f
Go check with him. What? ... Go! Go!

TAG: Maui_004_f
Great! Let's go... Wait. What? I did not see that coming.
