The Village is shaping up, thanks to all the cool stuff I've brought... like coconuts.

TAG: Maui_002_f
Hmm... Now what to do next...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I guess the sky's the limit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't have time to help right now.

TAG: Maui_003_f
The sky...? Ha. That's it!

TAG: Maui_004_f
I remember Goofy used to have this flying thing he called a "kite." Trust me, it was a big hit. Okay, go find what we need to make kites so everyone can enjoy the breeze!

TAG: Maui_005_f
(The breeze that I harnessed. You're welcome.)

TAG: Maui_001_f
I'm pretty sure they're made with <ActivityItem>Wood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Fiber</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Maui_009_f
Oh, and get some <ActivityItem>Ink</ActivityItem> to put designs on them. I'm thinking my profile. Who wouldn't love that?

TAG: Maui_006_f
Right, right. You've got things, I've got things.

TAG: Maui_007_f
Don't worry about it. I'll be here.
