Oh boy, am I glad to see you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_f
Ursula is very angry with you...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's not like you to go back on your promises.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What happened?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Aren't you afraid to be added to her garden?

TAG: Donald_004_f
WAKKK! That's not what I'm doin'!

TAG: Donald_007_f
She tried to trick me.

TAG: Donald_008_f
I asked her to help me find a special gift for you, and she gave me that <ActivityItem>Mysterious Blue Box</ActivityItem>. But she told me not to open it.

TAG: Donald_009_f
I was about to give it to you when I saw the box open by itself and start eating Dreamlight Magic!

TAG: Donald_010_f
I told her I wasn't gonna pay her, or give it back to her, or give it to you 'cause there's something screwy with it! That's when she got mad.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Wow, that's so nice of you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What did you intend to do about it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I ain't afraid of a box.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Aw, it's the least I could do for you.

TAG: Donald_015_f
But now that you know about it, we should destroy it.

TAG: Donald_016_f
Good idea. I'll go fetch it.

TAG: Donald_017_f
It's in my House. It looks like a blue box. I put it under something for safe keeping. I can't remember where, but I'm sure you'll find it.

TAG: Donald_013_f
I hadn't come up with anything yet.

TAG: Donald_014_f
Hey, I'm not afraid! I was just... uh, brainstorming a plan. Yeah, that's it!

TAG: Donald_006_f
You bet I am! But I don't want you added either!
