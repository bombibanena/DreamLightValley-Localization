Vanellope? How you doing there?

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
They're just cluttering everything up and getting in my way. And it turns out, I can't move them.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
ARRRGH!

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Whoa, are you all right?

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
No!

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
He... filled it with skulls?

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
Yeah! He showed up with a nice little box, saying it was a Dreamlight Day gift.

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
I opened it up and all these skulls popped out!

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
I thought maybe they were a cool power-up, or some new type of currency, but no!

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
Trust me, {PlayerName}. There's a difference between FUNNY and ANNOYING!

TAG: Mirabel_018_f
Ah, you're just too close to the situation. If this was happening to someone else, you'd be laughing too.

TAG: Mirabel_019_f
... Okay, you got me there.

TAG: Mirabel_020_f
You know what's even worse? I can't smash them!

TAG: Mirabel_021_f
I tried Ralph's signature smash, but now my hand is just sticky.

TAG: Mirabel_014_f
Hey, he's a skeleton, right? Does that mean he doesn't actually have a brain?

TAG: Mirabel_015_f
And you still helped him out with his whole ridiculous plan anyway?!

TAG: Mirabel_016_f
Hey, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt!
