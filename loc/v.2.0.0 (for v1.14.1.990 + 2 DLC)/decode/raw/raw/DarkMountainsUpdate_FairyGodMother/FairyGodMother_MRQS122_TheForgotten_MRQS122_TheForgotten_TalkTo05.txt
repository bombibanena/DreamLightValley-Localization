All right, {PlayerName}, it's time to pass through the first gate. There you'll find yourself inside one of the Forgotten's oldest Memories.

For as long as you're in that place, you'll BE the Forgotten. You'll see and hear what they saw and heard. But more than that... you'll feel what the Forgotten felt.

Well, if you ever feel yourself becoming lost in the Forgotten's Memory... simply step back through the gate, and I'll be here waiting for you.

When you're ready, <Lore>step through the gate</Lore> and see what sealed the Forgotten's fate.

I'm afraid it may not be that easy. But I'll be here waiting to help you understand when you return.

I'm afraid not. These are just fragments of the past as the Forgotten remembers them. It cannot be changed. Only understood.
