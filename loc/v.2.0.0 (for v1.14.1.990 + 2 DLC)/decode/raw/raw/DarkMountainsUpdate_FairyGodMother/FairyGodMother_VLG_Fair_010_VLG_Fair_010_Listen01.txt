Ah, my dear old friend! How good it is to see you again!

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
Well, I'm here now, dear. And I'm sure the two of us will get to the bottom of this little pickle.

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
Oh, I'm afraid neither of us holds the key to solving this.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
What we need is Dreamlight Magic.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
Goodness, yes... Of course. So only {PlayerName} can manage it...

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Well, thank you, Merlin. We'll be off. But you and I must meet for tea again soon.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
All this Forgetting business means we haven't had our little tea-time chats in far too long.

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
Oh-ho-ho! I'd forgotten about that! We must resume as soon as possible!

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Now then, why were we...

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
Oh yes! I'm afraid this is not a social call, Merlin. {PlayerName} and I are on a quest.

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
We're looking for a way to douse the fires in the Forgotten Lands.

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
An industrious quest indeed!

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
Why, I've tried to solve that problem myself but, heh, I'm afraid it's quite the conundrum...

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
None of my experiments have been successful at all!
