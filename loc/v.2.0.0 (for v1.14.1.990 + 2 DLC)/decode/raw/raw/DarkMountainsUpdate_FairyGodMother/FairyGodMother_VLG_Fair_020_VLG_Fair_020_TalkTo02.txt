{PlayerName}, I've heard you were a very fine substitute fairy godparent!

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
Thank you for your help, dear.

Though I'm afraid I've had no luck finding <ActivityItem>Merlin's Book</ActivityItem>. And I've no idea where else to look!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
When's the last time you saw it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Where have you looked?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe Merlin just took it back, and he's playing you?

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
Hmm... Was it...? Oh yes! It was two days ago. I was reading before bed.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
I know it's not in the Plaza, at the Beach, my favorite parts of the Forgotten Lands...

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
And Merlin couldn't have taken it back without telling me. He's very serious about his books. He won't even let me order them by color.

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
I fear it's simply vanished.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
Wait. You never looked in your House?

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
My...? Oh... Oh my! I suppose I haven't!

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
I must have forgotten.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Don't worry. I'll go take a look for you.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Simply, everywhere! The Plaza, the Beach, my favorite parts of the Forgotten Lands...

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
I know I had it... two days ago. That's right. I was reading before bed...

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
Oh, I highly doubt that, dear. Merlin is very serious about his books. He won't even let me order them by color.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
I know I had it... two days ago. That's right. I was reading before bed...

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
But I've looked everywhere: the Plaza, the Beach, my favorite part of the Forgotten Lands...
