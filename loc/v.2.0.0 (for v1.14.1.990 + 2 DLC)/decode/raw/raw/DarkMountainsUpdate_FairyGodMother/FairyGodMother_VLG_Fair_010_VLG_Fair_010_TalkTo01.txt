{PlayerName}, I have good news and bad news.

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
To the fiery pollution, we've found a solution...

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
But fighting such a flame is no mere game...

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
You must rely on your Dreamlight Magic.

TAG: Player_000_f
Enchanting my Royal Watering Can should do the trick...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's figure it out together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can you think of any Ingredients to use?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Magic water beats magic fire... I guess.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
Oh-ho-ho, yes! That's splendid, dear. Splendid!

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
Now... Hmm... Let's see...

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
Perhaps we could use some <ActivityItem>Tourmaline</ActivityItem> against the fire's green color, some <ActivityItem>Snowballs</ActivityItem> to make everything cooler...

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
<ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> to seal the spell... and <ActivityItem>Purple Impatiens</ActivityItem> so all will be well...

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
I'll gather everything. You can count on me. And then, what's the next step?

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Put everything in an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem> to create an <ActivityItem>Icy Enchantment</ActivityItem> and apply it to your Watering Can.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Oh yes, of course, child.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Well, that's certainly quite possible, {PlayerName}... I wonder...

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
... Why, yes, I think it just might work!
