Fairy Godmother? Hello?

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
Oh! Oh... yes... Goodness! How long have you been standing here, dear?

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
A little while.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
I'm terribly sorry... *yawn* You see, I've been a bit tired, and there are so many wishes to keep track of...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe someone should help YOU for a change? Let me make YOUR dreams come true!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm busy now, but maybe I can help you later.

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
Oh, but I'm... well, I'm so used to making the dreams of others come true, I wouldn't have a clue what to wish for.

TAG: Player_001_f
No worries. You just relax. I'll talk to Merlin.

He probably has a book on fairy godparent burnout.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He's your friend, too. I'm sure he'd want to help.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
I couldn't agree more, dear.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
Well, he is quite knowledgeable on a range of topics...

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Yes, Merlin has been a marvelous friend. And he's quite a talented wizard...

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Oh, of course. Why, you're even more busy than I am. Thank you, child.
