You've returned! Splendid! Now, what did you learn inside?

TAG: Player_000_f
It was so strange. I felt everything the Forgotten must have felt. The Forgotten...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...stopped being able to share their feelings.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...lost their excitement for life.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...seemed like just a moody teenager to me.

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
The Forgotten was so sad and lonely and frustrated... but they couldn't seem to talk about it with anyone.

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
Ah, yes... Sometimes the most painful thing to have is a friendly ear when what you want is to be sure no one will hear.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
I fear that the key to stopping the Forgotten lies in another of these Memories...

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
...but do you feel, at least, that you understand the Forgotten a bit better now?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
The Forgotten never asked to be stuck here. If I felt that lonely and frustrated... I guess I might do some of the things the Forgotten has done, too.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Many would. But just because we can understand the Forgotten doesn't mean we must agree with the path they walked down.

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
Let's hope that the next Memory holds the key to finding the Forgotten and helping them.

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
Now, {PlayerName}, <Lore>follow me</Lore>. There's so much more here to see.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
I thought that if the Forgotten was going to hide a Memory, it would be something... bigger.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
But that wasn't any big trauma or sadness. It was just... a bad day.

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
Perhaps the moments that define us... the moments we most want to forget... don't always look the way we would expect.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
It was such a beautiful day in the Valley... but everything just seemed like a chore.

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
Oh dear. It's sad indeed when what once brought joy... now only serves to vex and annoy.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
The Forgotten was so moody and annoyed with everything! I hope that's not what I was like when I was younger...

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
Well, the Forgotten IS a part of you, dear.
