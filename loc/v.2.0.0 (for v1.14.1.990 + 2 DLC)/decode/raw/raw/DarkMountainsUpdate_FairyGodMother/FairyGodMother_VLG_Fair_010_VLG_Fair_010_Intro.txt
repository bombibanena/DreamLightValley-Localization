My dear, would you have time for a little chat about the Forgotten Lands?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not right now.

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
Splendid! ... Now first, I would like to know: Do you think it's a place of woe?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I love the mood of the place.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm pretty neutral about it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It gives me nightmares.

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
Ah, you're like me! Marvelous!

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
But I do fear that... sadly, many Villagers don't agree.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
I suspect it's the small blazes scattered about.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
What do you have in mind?

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
Well now, I've spent some time pondering the problem, and I believe in this case, two enchanters would be most helpful.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
And, lucky for us, there's a second talented enchanter here. Shall we go consult Merlin, my dear?

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
Well, it's always good to keep an open mind. I happen to find it fairly charming.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Oh dear.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Well, you're not the only one. Many of the Villagers aren't terribly fond of that part of the Valley.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Well, when you're ready to hear my plea, simply come and speak to me!
