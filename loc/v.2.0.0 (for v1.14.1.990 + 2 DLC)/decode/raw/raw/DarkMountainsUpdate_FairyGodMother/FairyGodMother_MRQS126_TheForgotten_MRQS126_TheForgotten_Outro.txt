Well, {PlayerName}? What did you discover in the final Memory?

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
Scar tricked the Forgotten into helping the Night Thorns spread. And then Merlin showed up...

TAG: Player_000_f
Merlin warned the Forgotten not to lose faith in love, friendship, and the power of small acts of care...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But it was too late.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think he almost got through to the Forgotten...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The Forgotten was tired of being lectured to.

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
The Forgotten was too far gone.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
We mustn't give up. Merlin may have planted a seed in the Forgotten's mind. Perhaps it just needs a little watering...

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
In the final Memory... it looked like the Forgotten ran away to a castle. I've seen that castle before.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
There's another side of Dreamlight Valley. A shadowy side. You can get there through portals...

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Of course! If you're ever to save the Forgotten, you must venture to the Forgotten's home and face them there.

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
But how to get there? Perhaps it's time I consult with Merlin.

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
Oh! Before I depart... now that the Forgotten's Memories are recovered, the Orb of Remembrance is repaired!

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
Be a dear and <Lore>return it to the Pillar in the Forgotten Lands</Lore> while I seek out Merlin. Goodbye for now. I will see you soon!

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
Merlin planted a seed in the Forgotten's mind. If we could just water it... give it a little sunlight...

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
I agree. The Forgotten is not lost to us for good. Not yet.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
The Forgotten needed someone to understand. Not someone to give advice.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
And no one could ever understand the Forgotten better than you, child.
