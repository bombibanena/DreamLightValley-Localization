Goofy_001_f4Well, I'm not always cheerful, but I sure try to be.

Goofy_002_fâIf I'm feelin' down, I try to think about a real good memory of spending time with my friends. That's sure to put a big smile on my face!

Goofy_003_f©I sorta just stumbled into it! I was walking down the street with some apples and ran into Uncle Scrooge. He asked how much they were, but I said he could just have one!

Goofy_004_fcHe said I shouldn't be givin' away somethin' for nothing. So, I asked him what I should do instead.

Goofy_006_fÄAw, that's easy. Every sandwich! Today, I'm really lookin' forward to the pickle and peanut butter on rye one I made last night.
