Anna_000_f%This is it! Kristoff's Climbing Gear!

Anna_001_fVOh, but it's really wrecked. I don't think he'll remember much from looking at this...

Player_000_choice_000_fHe might remember falling?
M
Player_000_choice_001_f2I could try buying some new climbing gear instead?
:
Player_000_choice_002_fYou're right. So what do we do?
[

Anna_004_fMI think even without a magically erased memory, he'd rather forget that part.
\

Anna_002_fNMaybe I could fix the climbing gear, so it would be like how he remembered it?
C

Anna_007_f5You'd do that? {PlayerName}, you are the actual best!

Anna_008_fOI think I know what I'll need to fix this. I'll come talk to you when I'm done.

Anna_005_fpI don't think that'll work. It has to be something from our past together if it's gonna bring back his memories.


Anna_006_fGood question...
