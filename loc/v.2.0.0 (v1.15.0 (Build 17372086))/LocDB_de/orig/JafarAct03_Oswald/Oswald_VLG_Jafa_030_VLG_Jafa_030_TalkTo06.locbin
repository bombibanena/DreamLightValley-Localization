K
Oswald_002_f;Gee thanks, {PlayerName}! I'd have been a goner without ya!
/
Oswald_003_fI'm just glad that you're okay.
e
Oswald_004_fUBut now we need to do something about Jafar. Time to look into another lamp, I think.
(
Oswald_005_fHold up, {PlayerName}...
c
Oswald_006_fSWhen I was under that gizmo of Jafar's, it was connectin' me to him, and I think...
=
Oswald_007_f-...I think I got a glimpse into how he ticks.
S
Player_000_choice_000_f8I'm so sorry â€” that can't have been a good experience.
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$Do you need a sauna to sweat it out?
0
Player_000_choice_002_fOh? What did you see?
F
Oswald_008_f6It sure wasn't, but maybe not for the reason ya think.
G
Oswald_011_f7{PlayerName}... Jafar's heart is lousy with loneliness.
D
Oswald_012_f4Back in the lamp might not be the savvy choice here.

Oswald_016_fYou betcha. Thanks to you!
c
Oswald_019_fSI don't know... Jafar has shown us multiple times that he only cares about himself.
T
Oswald_020_fDHow can we trust that he won't try to take over Eternity Isle again?
1
Oswald_021_f!Gee... I, uh... I guess we can't.
q
Oswald_022_faBut he ain't the only villain here. And you keep a close eye on them, and they don't dare act up!
S
Oswald_023_fCMaybe just livin' around so much Dreamlight Magic makes 'em better.
G
Oswald_024_f7That's... very wise of you, Oswald. I'll talk to Jafar.
