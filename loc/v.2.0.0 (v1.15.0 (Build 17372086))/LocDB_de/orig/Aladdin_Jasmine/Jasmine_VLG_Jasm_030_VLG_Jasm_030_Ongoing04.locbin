Jasmine_001_fÊDidn't you say you were going to <Lore>take pictures of the Pedestal Symbols in the Frosted Heights and on the Sunlit Plateau</Lore>? That's our best clue for how to open the chest in Elsa's Ice Cavern.

Jasmine_000_fDo you need help finding them?

Player_000_choice_002_fNo, I'm okay for now.

Jasmine_002_fGIf it were me, I'd <Lore>look around the perimeter of each area</Lore>.

Jasmine_005_f}Well, on the Sunlit Plateau, you could look <Lore>near Scar's Cave</Lore>. I remember a couple of interesting drawings there.

Jasmine_007_f„I'd also look around the <Lore>far corners, near water, and on rocks along the edge between the Sunlit Plateau and the Plaza</Lore>.

Jasmine_008_f In the Frosted Heights, I'd check <Lore>the farthest corners of the area</Lore>. Aladdin and I noticed some odd markings there on one of our days out exploring.

Jasmine_009_fWThen, I'd take a look <Lore>near water and on rocks along the edge to the north</Lore>.
