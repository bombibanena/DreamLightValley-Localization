Player_001_choice_000_fAre you all right?
8
Player_001_choice_001_fWell, let's go rescue Carpet!
D
Player_001_choice_002_f)Now we can work together to save Agrabah!
G
Jasmine_002_f6Huh, you seem familiar. Like we met a long time ago...
q
Aladdin_000_f`It's me, {PlayerName}. I came to see if you and Jasmine want to visit Dreamlight Valley with me.
@
Aladdin_003_f/Dreamlight Valley? That sort of rings a bell...
–
Jasmine_003_f„I'm here to find you! I got to Agrabah and found the Windcaller just looming over everything and whipping the winds into a frenzy...
_
Jasmine_004_fNI was able to make my way over to Jasmine and she explained what was going on.
¸
Jasmine_009_f¦Heh. Yeah, I guess I've been stuck here for a while now. I was trying to fly up to the Windcaller to figure things out, but Carpet and I got hit by a nasty downdraft.
R
Jasmine_010_fAI fell here, and Carpet's been caught up in the winds ever since.
M
Aladdin_001_f<I'm fine. The worst I've had to deal with is some sand-burn.
T
Aladdin_002_fCWell, get ready to head back into the marketplace to fix things up!
q
Jasmine_012_f`And then maybe you and Jasmine will be able to take a break and visit Dreamlight Valley with me.
ž
Jasmine_013_fŒYa know, that place sounds more and more familiar... But Jasmine'll want to make sure that everyone in Agrabah's safe before we go anywhere.
