Jasmine_005_fMJasmine! We've got the <ActivityItem>Alchemy Table</ActivityItem> all set up!
ù
Jasmine_006_fãWonderful! I've been examining the <ActivityItem>Ancient Tome</ActivityItem>, and I think I know what we need to do to stop the Windcaller.
P
Jasmine_007_f?The first thing we need is a <ActivityItem>Lamp</ActivityItem>.
6
Player_000_choice_000_fLike... a magic genie lamp?
2
Player_000_choice_001_fShouldn't be a problem!
E
Player_000_choice_002_f*Please tell me this doesn't involve Jafar.
)
Jasmine_008_fWell, something similar.
û
Jasmine_011_fåIf I'm right, we can create a lamp that will house the energy surrounding the Windcaller in the same way that a lamp contains a bound genie.
/
Jasmine_012_fAll right, how do we craft it?
K
Jasmine_013_f:Well, we'll need <ActivityItem>Gold Shards</ActivityItem>.
ß
Jasmine_014_fïThere was some that was going to be used to decorate the fountain, but the ingots got pulled into the winds and set down with the sandstone deposits.
â
Jasmine_015_fxIf you can find <ActivityItem>Gold Shards</ActivityItem> and a mold we can pour the gold into, that should do the trick.
ù
Jasmine_002_fãI'm sure there's a <ActivityItem>Lamp Mold</ActivityItem> in the <Lore>Artisans' District</Lore>... though it may be buried under the sand.
Õ
Jasmine_016_fªAll right, I can handle that ‚Äî especially with the <ActivityItem>Protection Amulet</ActivityItem> that I made with Aladdin. And once I have the <ActivityItem>Lamp</ActivityItem> forged?
†
Jasmine_018_féI'm still not sure. Why don't you come see me once you've made the Lamp, and I'll keep studying the <ActivityItem>Ancient Tome</ActivityItem>.

Jasmine_009_f	Fabulous!

Jasmine_010_fFortunately not!
