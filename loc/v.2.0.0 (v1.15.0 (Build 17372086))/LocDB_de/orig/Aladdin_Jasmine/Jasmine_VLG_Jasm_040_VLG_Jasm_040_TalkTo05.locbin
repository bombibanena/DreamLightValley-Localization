Jasmine_005_f\I've spoken to Donald, Anna, and Mike. All of them made a wish that's gone a little haywire.
y
Jasmine_000_fhThat lines up with a theory I have... In your journal, you wrote, "If only wishes really did come true"?
V
Jasmine_012_fEWhat if opening the journal caused this strange wish magic to escape?
/
Player_001_choice_000_fSo this is my fault?
H
Player_001_choice_001_f-Do you think the wish magic can be dangerous?
<
Player_001_choice_002_f!I was thinking something similar.
V
Jasmine_006_fEIt's no one's fault, {PlayerName}. Opening the journal was important.
V
Jasmine_009_fEBut now we need to rein in the magic so it stops creating such chaos.
#
Jasmine_010_fHow do we do that?
X
Jasmine_001_fGI'm not sure. Do you remember the wish you wrote about in your journal?
1
Player_002_choice_000_fI wanted more freedom.
B
Player_002_choice_001_f'I wanted to be understood for who I am.
D
Player_002_choice_002_f)I wanted to take care of myself for once.
{
Jasmine_016_fjThat's right. So maybe if you do something to embrace your freedom, the wish magic can be contained again.
$
Jasmine_019_fThat's a good idea!

Player_000_choice_000_f(I'd like to decorate a room in my House.

Player_000_choice_001_f#I'd like to cook my favorite meals.
V
Jasmine_002_fEPerfect! Decorating's a wonderful way to embrace your personal taste.
r
Jasmine_004_faOkay, I'll go <Lore>decorate a room in my House</Lore>, and I'll make sure it really reflects me!
i
Jasmine_011_fXFabulous! A meal cooked just to your taste is a wonderful way to do what YOU want to do.
u
Jasmine_003_fdOkay, I'll go <Lore>cook two of my favorite meals</Lore>, and I'll make sure they really reflect me!

Jasmine_017_fkThat's right. So maybe if you do something to showcase the real you, the wish magic can be contained again.
|
Jasmine_018_fkThat's right. So maybe if you do something to take care of yourself, the wish magic can be contained again.
N
Jasmine_007_f=I highly doubt it. Only fairly benign wishes are coming true.
@
Jasmine_008_f/I thought you might have worked it out already.
