Jasmine_001_fºHe was underwater when he made it, so I don't think I can really find any of the wish magic hanging around here. But, can you tell me any more about this fountain that you were building?
 
Jasmine_002_fŽOf course! There aren't many sources of fresh water nearby, so Genie used his magic to enchant a reservoir to change sea water to fresh water.
‹
Jasmine_003_fzThe reservoir is almost full, but with the work on the fountain halted, we were never able to pump any water into Agrabah.
