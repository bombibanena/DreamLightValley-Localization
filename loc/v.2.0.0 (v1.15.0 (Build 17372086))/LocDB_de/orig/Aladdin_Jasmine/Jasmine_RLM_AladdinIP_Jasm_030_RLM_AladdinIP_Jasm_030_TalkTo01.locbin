Jasmine_000_f;Hey Aladdin, can we talk about your experience with wishes?
0
Aladdin_000_fSure! What do you want to know?
v
Aladdin_001_feAny details you can share would be good. You never know what might lead us to some of the wish magic.
 
Player_000_fTell me about...
.
Player_000_choice_000_f...your first wish.
/
Player_000_choice_001_f...your second wish.
.
Player_000_choice_002_f...your third wish.
E
Player_000_choice_004_f*No, I know all about those wishes already.

Aladdin_002_fJOh, that one... Not exactly my smartest idea, but I wished to be a prince.
’
Aladdin_003_f€I was in an oasis not too far from Agrabah, and Abu and I had managed to trick Genie into getting us out of the Cave of Wonders.
~
Aladdin_004_fmHe was kinda annoyed that we pulled one over on him, so I had to be pretty clear that this was my first wish.
a
Aladdin_011_fPWell, let's get started. Those remnants of Genie's wishes won't find themselves!

Aladdin_005_f$My second wish was a real emergency.
{
Aladdin_006_fjI was caught by the guards loyal to Jafar, and they slapped some manacles on me and threw me into the sea!
˜
Aladdin_007_f†I never would've made it without Genie's help. To be honest, I barely even remember making the wish, but I'm sure glad Genie saved me.

Aladdin_008_f!That was definitely my best wish!

Aladdin_009_fLWe were on a balcony overlooking the city, and I wished for Genie's freedom.
ˆ
Aladdin_010_fwGenie didn't believe me at first. I think I was halfway to being a prince again before he really heard what I'd wished.
