Jasmine_000_fgI found this <ActivityItem>Envelope of Seeds</ActivityItem> in Merlin's library! Do they look familiar?
Å
Jasmine_001_fpThe seeds! Oh, I remember now! I asked Merlin to help me... There was something I needed to keep safe from harm.

Player_000_choice_000_fWhat was it?
-
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat kind of harm?
:
Player_000_choice_002_fUsing flower pots and seeds...?
V
Jasmine_002_fEI can't remember that part, but I do know it was something important.
%
Jasmine_006_fSomething important?
R
Player_001_choice_000_f7How important could it be if you've forgotten about it?
E
Player_001_choice_001_f*And you really don't remember what it was?
C
Player_001_choice_002_f(Merlin mentioned something about this...
<
Jasmine_009_f+I'm not sure... It's just a feeling I have.
F
Jasmine_017_f5Hmm... Actually, Merlin mentioned something, as well.
¢
Jasmine_010_fêThere was a secret hidden inside an Enchanted Flower. You must have been helping to protect this secret. I just wish you remembered what it was.
q
Jasmine_011_f`So do I... But it's good to know we're on the right path. Did Merlin say what we should do next?
ã
Jasmine_012_fzWe need to <Lore>craft the Enchanted Pots of Blooming</Lore> and <Lore>gather the correct flowers</Lore> to plant in them.
c
Jasmine_013_fRMerlin said they needed to be carefully tended to, in order for the magic to work.
ñ
Jasmine_014_fÑWell then, while you gather everything we need, I'll make some adjustments in my House so the environment's perfect for the flowers.

Jasmine_015_f
Sadly, no.
W
Jasmine_018_fFMerlin also couldn't remember details, but he did mention something...
%
Jasmine_016_fOh? What did he say?
Ñ
Jasmine_003_fsI'm not sure. I just know whatever the item was, it needed to be protected. So it must've been something important.
]
Jasmine_004_fLYes, but not just any seeds and flower pots! There's magic embedded in them.

Jasmine_005_f,I was trying to protect something important.
