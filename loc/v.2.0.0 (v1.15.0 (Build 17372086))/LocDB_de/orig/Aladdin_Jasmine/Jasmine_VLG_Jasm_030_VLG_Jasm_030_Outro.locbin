Jasmine_000_fNNow that I have the journal... I guess there's nothing left to do but read it.
=
Jasmine_002_f,You can do this. Remember: I'm here for you.
v
Jasmine_025_feIt says, "People expect so much from me. It's so hard. I feel like I'm falling apart at the seams..."
$
Jasmine_024_fOh, {PlayerName}...
 
Jasmine_001_fThere's more...
L
Player_002_choice_000_f1... "I don't think anyone really understands me."
K
Player_002_choice_001_f0... "I'm so sick and tired of responsibilities!"
O
Player_002_choice_002_f4... "I can't possibly meet everyone's expectations."
v
Jasmine_022_fe... "I wish I had the freedom to do what I wanted, just once. If only wishes really did come true..."
>
Jasmine_004_f-Oh, {PlayerName}... I don't know what to say.
³
Jasmine_005_f¡I remember now... When I was young, it felt like everyone was telling me what to do all of the time. I never had a chance to do what I wanted, to just be myself.

~
Jasmine_009_fmThe worst part was how trapped I felt. This journal was the only place I felt free to be honest about myself.
]
Jasmine_010_fLI understand what it's like to feel trapped and that no one understands you.

Jasmine_026_fYes, exactly!
%
Jasmine_029_fWhat does that mean?
’
Jasmine_020_f€I don't know. The journal certainly has magical properties. I thought they were just protection spells, but now I'm not so sure.
ª
