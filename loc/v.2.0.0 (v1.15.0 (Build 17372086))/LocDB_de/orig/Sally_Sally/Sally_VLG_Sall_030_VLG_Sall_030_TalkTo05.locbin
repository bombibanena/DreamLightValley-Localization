Sally_000_fc{PlayerName}, I'm not sure that what Daisy and Minnie have planned right now is quite right for me.
s
Sally_001_fdThey're very talented, and I admire them both... But I should find someone else to sew with for now.
g
Sally_003_fXThis place is so magical. I'd love to learn from someone who understands the magic here.

Player_003_choice_000_fThe Fairy Godmother?

Player_003_choice_001_fHow about Jack?

Player_003_choice_002_fI don't knowâ€” Merlin?
u
Sally_016_ffDo you think she would?! She gave me a recipe the other day for iced pumpkin juice that was delicious.
i
Sally_017_fZAnd she and I have been visiting so much â€” I can't believe I didn't think of her before.
U
Sally_007_fFI'm sure we could find a way to combine our styles if we made a quilt.
G
Sally_004_f8And perhaps we could even get a third person to join us.

Sally_010_f.Would you like to quilt with us, {PlayerName}?

Player_001_choice_000_fI thought you'd never ask.

Player_001_choice_001_fAre you sure you want my help?

Player_001_choice_002_fLET'S START NOW!!!
S
Sally_012_fDI'm so glad. Now, all we need is the Fairy Godmother to say yes too!

Sally_009_f#Could you <Lore>talk to her</Lore>?
~
Sally_002_foPlease ask her about making a quilt. While you do that, I'm going to borrow a few things from Minnie and Daisy.
m
Sally_011_f^Certainly. With you and the Fairy Godmother, I'm sure we can make something quite interesting.
J
Sally_014_f;I'm glad you're excited. I hope the Fairy Godmother is too.
Y
Sally_013_fJJack is wonderful at many things, but I'm afraid sewing isn't one of them.
Š
Sally_018_f{That DOES give me an idea, though... The Fairy Godmother! She and Jack get along so well because of her love of pumpkins...

Sally_015_f&Merlin seems a little busy for sewing.

Sally_019_f/Oh, but he and the Fairy Godmother are close...
