Sally_002_fHey Sally, what's going on?
e
Sally_003_fV{PlayerName}, I was wondering... would you consider yourself an experimental gardener?
&
Player_000_choice_000_fAbsolutely!
H
Player_000_choice_001_f-Uhh, lemme go think about that for a while...
P
Sally_004_fAWhat kind of experimental gardening have you been thinking about?
X
Sally_005_fIWell, I've seen the lovely gardening projects the other Villagers have...
b
Sally_006_fS...and I thought it would be nice to cultivate some more herbs from Halloween Town.
4
Player_001_choice_000_fCool, what kind of herbs?
?
Player_001_choice_001_f$The deadly nightshade wasn't enough?
4
Player_001_choice_002_fDo they grow here easily?
K
Sally_008_f<Oh, maybe some henbane, witch hazel, a little worm's wort...
½
Sally_019_f­Once it's ready, please meet me in the <Lore>Vitalys Mines</Lore>. The darkness and humidity levels there should be very good for a <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem>.
r
Sally_011_fcI tried growing the herbs myself, but they don't seem to want to grow the way they would back home.
S
Sally_012_fDOh no! Do they need some kind of special treatment to grow properly?
l
Sally_013_f]Perhaps. I do know that the soil in Halloween Town is naturally more rich than the soil here.
»
Sally_014_f«After all, there are always dried leaves and things rotting in it. So, I thought maybe we could make our own <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem> to try to mimic that.
4
Sally_015_f%That sounds like a great idea, Sally!
C
Sally_016_f4Let's see, we'll need to <Lore>craft a bin</Lore>...
\
Sally_017_fMAnd maybe <Lore>Remy could give us some trimmings</Lore> from his restaurant.
?
Sally_018_f0I'll start gathering materials and talk to Remy!
á
Sally_009_fÑWell, it's nice to have other flavors for balance and some herbs have other uses. Also, deadly nightshade isn't good for everyone. Besides, a few more herbs would bring more of a Halloween touch to the Valley.

Sally_010_fUnfortunately, no...
