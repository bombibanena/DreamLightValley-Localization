A
Sally_003_f2It's... knocked over? And all the compost is gone!
A
Sally_004_f2After all our hard work! Who could have done this?

Player_000_choice_000_fA compost demon!
,
Player_000_choice_001_fI have no idea...

Player_000_choice_002_fMaybe a critter got into it?
g
Sally_005_fXOh! Do you have demons in Dreamlight Valley, too? Ones that make their homes in compost?
<
Sally_006_f-Nah, that was just a joke â€” I have no idea.
*
Sally_007_fWhat do you think happened?
;
Sally_009_f,I wonder if one of the critters got into it.
e
Sally_010_fVHmm, so what's our next step, then? We need to do something to secure the Compost Bin.
›
Sally_011_f‹Well, if it IS a critter, maybe we should try to trap it so it can be relocated to a part of the Valley where it won't disturb the compost.
Y
Sally_012_fJGood idea! I can look into crafting a humane trap for our mystery critter.
ª
Sally_013_fšI should probably include some <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>. A little magic should help the trap resize itself for whatever stumbles into it.

Sally_014_fGood luck, {PlayerName}!
 
Sally_008_fThat seems right.
