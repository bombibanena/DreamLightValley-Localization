Sally_000_f;Well, if you wanted to have a little flavor of Halloween...
n
Sally_001_f_...you could put up some bat boxes or perhaps build a belfry to invite some new winged friends.
p
Sally_002_faOr you could invite more witches. They're very good at helping you get into the Halloween spirit.

Bat boxes?

Player_001_choice_002_fI love BOTH of these ideas!
&
Sally_003_fYes. What do you think?
,
Player_002_choice_000_fI love this idea!
:
Player_002_choice_001_fWe might have enough witches...
$
Sally_007_fI'm glad you like it.
i
Sally_013_fZPerhaps we could sew them some decorative sleeves for their broomsticks as a welcome gift.
>
Sally_008_f/I mean, we have ONE sea witch and she's plenty.
i
Sally_014_fZPerhaps you're right. Ursula IS formidable. I think she'd fit in nicely in Halloween Town.
c
Sally_004_fTYes. You can never have too many bats. And they're very good at controlling insects.

Player_003_choice_000_fBring on the bats!

Player_003_choice_001_fBats aren't my thing.
C
Sally_010_f4Hmm... Perhaps I'll sew them all a little something.
=
Sally_012_f.Bats wearing tiny hats might be quite festive.
C
Sally_009_f4That's all right. I'll keep thinking of new ideas...

Sally_005_fReally?
M
Sally_006_f>Well, I'll look forward to meeting anyone new that you invite.
`
Sally_011_fQAnd Jack will love any changes that bring a little more Halloween to the Village.
