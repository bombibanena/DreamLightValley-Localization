Jafar_002_f@Well? Where is the <ActivityItem>Royal Hourglass</ActivityItem>?
k
Jafar_003_f\Don't tell me that chirping little contraption scared you off and you have given up already?
F
Player_001_choice_000_f+She's not a "contraption." Her name is EVE.
B
Player_001_choice_002_f'Actually, that's exactly what happened.
[
Jafar_001_fLI do not care what her name is. I only care that she is standing in our way!
[
Jafar_015_fLI don't think she's going to give me that Hourglass unless I gain her trust.
@
Jafar_016_f1I wonder why she's so determined to protect it...
 
Jafar_017_fIsn't it obvious?

Jafar_018_fLoyalty!
d
Jafar_019_fUSomeone she DOES trust asked her to watch over it. And she has guarded it ever since.
+
Jafar_020_fAnd that someone was... you.

Jafar_022_fMe?!
Y
Jafar_023_fJThat is right, {PlayerName}. This is not your first time on Eternity Isle.

Jafar_024_f’Ages ago, you and that creature found the Hourglass. But you feared its power and asked her to guard over it until you decided what to do with it.
G
Jafar_028_f8She will not hand that Hourglass over to anyone but you.
ƒ
Jafar_026_ftI must have been just a kid. She doesn't recognize me anymore. If only there was some way to convince her it's me...
‚
Jafar_030_fsHer home is here in Ancient's Landing. I suggest you <Lore>search it</Lore> for something to use to convince her...

Jafar_021_f&And that someone was... the Old Ruler.
³
Jafar_025_f£Ages ago, the Old Ruler and that creature found the Hourglass. But the Ruler feared its power and asked her to guard over it until they decided what to do with it.
Q
Jafar_027_fBShe will not hand that Hourglass over to anyone but the Old Ruler.

Jafar_029_f™This might be a bit of a stretch but... maybe if we had some way to make her think I'm the Old Ruler... just long enough to get the Hourglass from her...

Jafar_011_fLWell, go back there and use your ingenuity to find a way to get it from her!
