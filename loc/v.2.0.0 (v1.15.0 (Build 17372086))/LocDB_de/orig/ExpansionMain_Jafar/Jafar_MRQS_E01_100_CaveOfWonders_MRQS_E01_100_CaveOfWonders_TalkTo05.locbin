Player_000_choice_000_fThis place looks incredible!
0
Player_000_choice_001_fEh, I've seen better.
\
Jafar_001_fMWhy thank you. I did endeavor to make it as close to the original as I could.
6
Player_002_choice_000_fYou made this all yourself?
9
Player_002_choice_001_fLess talk, more Jewel of Time.
ƒ
Jafar_005_ftIndeed I did! Though modeled on the original Cave of Wonders from my past, this one has very important distinctions.
Y
Jafar_011_fJAs I am sure you will see, I was able to customize the internal structure.
q
Jafar_006_fbMost importantly, I did away with those ridiculous restrictions on what may or may not be touched.
3
Jafar_007_f$So I can bring Gaston some treasure?
E
Jafar_008_f6Yes. Though, I cannot imagine why you would want to...
F
Jafar_020_f7The purpose of my Cave is to protect the Jewel of Time.
7
Jafar_021_f(What kind of protections did you set up?
H
Jafar_022_f9Oh, nothing that should trouble those with a keen mind...
6
Player_001_choice_001_fCan you give me some hints?
T
Player_001_choice_002_f9I don't need any hints â€” time to tackle this on my own!
f
Jafar_014_fWAh, {PlayerName}, I assumed that your level of intellect would require such assistance.
c
Jafar_015_fTThe magical structures within the Cave all revolve around the displacement of light.
W
Jafar_016_fHMirrors around the area can be positioned to redirect and aim the light.
j
Jafar_017_f[In addition, there are some devices that, when powered, will create light from new sources.

Jafar_018_f%Okay, I think I can work with this...
d
Jafar_019_fUExcellent. I shall remain available for communication should you require further aid.
]
Jafar_013_fNRemember: The Jewel of Time will be found in the deepest recesses of the Cave.
.
Jafar_024_fVery well. I await your return.
N
Jafar_004_f?But of course. Let us move on. Eternity Isle remains in danger.
