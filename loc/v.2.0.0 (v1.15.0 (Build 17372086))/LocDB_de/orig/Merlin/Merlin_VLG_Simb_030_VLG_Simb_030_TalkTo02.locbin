Merlin_001_f[Ah, {PlayerName}, you look like you're in pursuit of knowledge. How may I be of assistance?
U
Merlin_003_fEI've found this room below the Sunlit Plateau with seeds in it and...
Y
Merlin_004_fIThe Herbalist Room! What marvelous news! Why, I'd forgotten all about it.
Ç
Player_003_frI want to get something called the Dreamlight Tree Seed for Simba... But it's stuck in a machine inside that room.

Player_003_choice_000_fI need your help. Please.

Player_003_choice_001_fWhat does it all mean?
O
Player_003_choice_002_f4You're really good at understanding this nonsense...
+
Merlin_008_fNot to worry, {PlayerName}.
Ä
Merlin_015_fÔYou'll need <ActivityItem>Blueberries</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> for the <ActivityItem>Potion of Growth</ActivityItem>. <ActivityItem>Orange Marsh Milkweed</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Night Shards</ActivityItem> for the <ActivityItem>Potion of Dust</ActivityItem>. And an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem> for each potion.
è
Merlin_016_fOnce you've prepared them, just place them in the proper spot in the Herbalist Room and the machine should do the rest for you.
ú
Merlin_009_fãThe room you stumbled upon is a fascinating part of our history. In the past, you used it to do experiments regarding the Valley's flora...
ú
Merlin_007_fãYou hid the room to keep the experiments safe from the prying eyes of those who might want to use them for nefarious purposes. Like Scar...

Merlin_000_fTYou wanted to create a haven for the critters, and you chose Simba to watch over it.

Merlin_002_f∑Using a cutting of the tree above the Well in the Plaza, and after a lot of trial and error, you managed to create a new plant called the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>.

Merlin_005_fMThat's all well and good, but how does it help us with our problem right now?
W
Merlin_006_fGAh... The impatience of youth. I was just about to explain that part...
Æ
Merlin_013_fùRight now, the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seed</ActivityItem> is... Well, let's say it's "slumbering." You'll need to awaken it so it can be planted anew.
∞
Merlin_014_füIf I recall, you first gave life to it with two potions. The <ActivityItem>Potion of Growth</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Potion of Dust</ActivityItem>.

Merlin_010_fÖWell, if it's nonsense, it's your nonsense! You have only your past self to blame for it. But there's no need to fret. I'll help you.
