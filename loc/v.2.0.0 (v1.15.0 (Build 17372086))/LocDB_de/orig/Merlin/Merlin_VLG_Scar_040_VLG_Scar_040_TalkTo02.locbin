Merlin_000_fEAhh, {PlayerName}, what new magical mystery do you have for me today?
Æ
Player_000_fùBack before the Forgetting, I took something away from Scar and hid it with some sort of enchantment. Something he can only get back if he learns a lesson...
.
Player_000_choice_000_fI want to help him.
G
Player_000_choice_001_f,Enchantments and old riddles are your forte.
I
Player_000_choice_002_f.Past {PlayerName} is making life extra hard...
û
Merlin_006_fçYou wanted to help him then, too. In fact, you took his most treasured possession and told him he'd only get it back if he understood that...
Ç
Merlin_009_fr<Lore>"Good rulers care for everyone, from the tallest to the smallest. They invite everyone to the table."</Lore>
_
Merlin_001_fOQuite inspired, I thought. But then, you've always been wise beyond your years.
d
Merlin_007_fTNow, I'm sure you've noticed that Scar is not always the most pleasant of neighbors.
â
Merlin_002_fyHe wants to rule, but he doesn't understand the responsibilities and the care that come with it. You tried to help him...
e
Merlin_013_fU...but then he turned around and tried to eat one of the birds on the Sunlit Plateau.
<
Player_002_f,When I said inviting others to your table...
<
Player_002_choice_000_f!...I meant those birds as guests!
:
Player_002_choice_001_f...I wasn't speaking literally.
8
Player_002_choice_002_f...I could have been clearer.
l
Merlin_015_f\Yes, and not only the Sunbirds. You meant everyone, from all segments of the Circle of Life.
É
Merlin_018_fsI suggest you continue leading by example. Put up some <ActivityItem>Sunbird Feeders</ActivityItem> on the Plateau.
i
Merlin_019_fYShow him how to care for his kingdom. Maybe that will help where your curse has failed...
1
Player_001_choice_000_fThat would be so cute.
/
Player_001_choice_001_fLet's hope it works.
5
Player_001_choice_002_fI'll do whatever it takes.
~
Merlin_003_fnDon't let the Sunbirds' fragile appearance fool you, {PlayerName}. They have a fascinating yet dangerous life.
Z
Merlin_004_fJTrust your instincts. Deep down, you always know what to do, {PlayerName}.
)
Merlin_005_f"Whatever it takes"? Hmm.
_
Merlin_012_fOJust be careful not to become too much like Scar in your pursuit of your goals.
i
Merlin_016_fYYes, you meant that he should care for everyone, from all segments of the Circle of Life.
ë
Merlin_017_fÄYou wanted Scar to think about his actions. You meant that he should care for everyone, from all segments of the Circle of Life.
l
Merlin_010_f\Hmm. Yes, I remember what you said when you took it from him and hid it all those years ago.
f
Merlin_008_fVHmm, yes. Sometimes things we did long ago can seem like the deeds of strangers to us.
Y
Merlin_011_fIBut I remember what it was you said back when you hid his little trinket.
