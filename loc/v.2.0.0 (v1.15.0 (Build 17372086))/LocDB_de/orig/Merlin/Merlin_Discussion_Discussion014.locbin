Merlin_000_f9What small discoveries will you make today, {PlayerName}?
4
Player_000_choice_000_fWell, I'm talking to you.
(
Player_000_choice_001_fI don't know.
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$Small discoveries? What do you mean?
h
Merlin_001_fXIndeed! A conversation can be full of discoveries. What will we say? What will we think?
0
Merlin_004_f Where might our inquiry lead us?
6
Player_001_choice_000_fHopefully somewhere useful.
;
Player_001_choice_001_f Probably just around in circles.
X
Player_001_choice_002_f=You make talking to someone sound more exciting than it is...
U
Merlin_005_fEPractical conversations, with purpose and reason, are quite valuable.
_
Merlin_008_fOBut there are many discoveries to be found in the free flow of thought as well.

Merlin_006_fŒWell, when you don't know exactly where you're going, sometimes you get there faster going in circles instead of keeping to a straight line.
H
Merlin_007_f8Everything can be exciting with the correct perspective.
_
Merlin_002_fOHow exciting! Not knowing quite what will happen next. The thrill of discovery!
 
Player_002_choice_000_fYeah!
!
Player_002_choice_001_fMaybe?
8
Player_002_choice_002_fIt actually makes me nervous.
;
Merlin_009_f+Well, good luck on your journey, my friend!
j
Merlin_010_fZAhh... you respond to uncertainty with more uncertainty. A perfectly appropriate response.
i
Merlin_011_fYWell, being anxious is perfectly understandable. Just don't let it thwart your curiosity.
N
Merlin_012_f>One must be ready for uncertainty before one can thrive in it.
d
Merlin_003_fTWell, anything can be an opportunity for discovery, if you have the proper attitude.
n
Merlin_013_f^For example, a trip to Goofy's Stall. Who knows what one will discover in his inventory today?
<
Player_003_choice_000_f!That doesn't sound very exciting.
7
Player_003_choice_001_fEPIC APPLE VS. PEAR DILEMMA.
J
Player_003_choice_002_f/Being around Goofy is always full of surprises.
S
Merlin_014_fCPerhaps not on an ordinary day. But what if today is extraordinary?
$
Merlin_017_fThe choice is yours.
M
Merlin_015_f=Goodness, you're certainly getting into the spirit of things.
E
Merlin_016_f5Ah, yes. His boundless kindness, his unique wisdom...
>
Merlin_018_f....and his occasional prodigious clumsiness...
@
Merlin_019_f0Well, there's no one quite like Goofy, is there?
