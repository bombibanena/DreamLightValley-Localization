Player_001_choice_002_f6Even cooking cereal is too much of a challenge for me.

Remy_003_fuI was thinking we could open up some new culinary possibilities by <Lore>testing your cooking skills each day</Lore>.

Remy_004_fzAnd since you're a pro now, <Lore>I WON'T be giving you the recipes first</Lore>. You'll have to figure them out yourself.

Remy_009_fYDon't worry. I'm not asking you to work for free. If this works, we'll both get rewarded.
