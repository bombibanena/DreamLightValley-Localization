Remy_001_fåHey, {PlayerName}! I'd love to give you a special delivery order today, but I could use your help with something for the restaurant instead.
e

Remy_002_fWMy oven has called it quits! And on a day when everyone in the Valley's ordering pizza.
\

Remy_003_fNCould you find me some <ActivityItem>Tinkering Parts</ActivityItem> to fix it?
m

Remy_006_f_I'll still make sure you get some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> for helping me out.
'
Player_000_choice_000_fLet's do it!
1
Player_000_choice_001_fMaybe some other time.
-

Remy_007_fGreat! Thank you, {PlayerName}.
h

Remy_008_fZI'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you once you're done.
L

Remy_009_f>Hey, no worries. I'll try to get by until the problem's fixed.
£

Remy_010_fîThough, if you help me out, I'll be able to order more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> so you can build more great things for the Village.
û

Remy_011_fèIt occurred to me that the Village is starting to have a lot of couples in it. Couples who'd like a romantic table at the restaurant for dates.
à

Remy_012_fzSo, I thought that if you got me some flowers, I could put them out for special occasions. But I'll need a lot of flowers.
Ñ

Remy_014_fvI'm trying to buy a new wood-burning oven from Scrooge McDuck. He's asking for a whole lot of Star Coins to order one.
ñ

Remy_015_fáBut he said that if we could bring him some gems from around the Valley, he'd cut me a big discount. Think you could help me get those?
ê

Remy_016_fÅWhen I was getting something off a shelf the other day, I accidentally knocked over a bunch of my spices, and the jars shattered.
°

Remy_017_fíCould you get me some new <ActivityItem>Empty Vials</ActivityItem>? I need one for paprika, oregano, sage, rosemary, thyme... so five ought to do.
?

Remy_018_f1I just got this incredible new wood-burning oven!
<

Remy_019_f.But it goes through a LOT of wood really fast.
ç

Remy_020_fI'd gather it myself, but for me lugging one piece of wood back to Chez Remy is practically my whole day. Think you could help?
U

Remy_025_fGI'm running pretty low on fish, and I'd love to try some new varieties.
N

Remy_026_f@Could you get me some? I've got the perfect recipes ready to go!
U

Remy_027_fGI was talking to Merlin, and he had an interesting suggestion for me...
p

Remy_028_fbHe said I might be able to distill <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> into a magical spice.
á

Remy_029_fyBut I don't really know how to find those, and Merlin's using all of his for his experiments. Could you find some for me?
I

Remy_030_f;I'm tryin' to start a compost heap, but I need better soil.
Ö

Remy_031_fwI noticed that sometimes when you garden, <ActivityItem>Rich Soil</ActivityItem> turns up. That stuff would be perfect!
?

Remy_032_f1Next time you find some, could you bring it over?
