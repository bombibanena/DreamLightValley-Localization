Remy_001_fOHey, {PlayerName}! Are you ready for another challenge of your culinary skills?
°

Remy_002_fíToday's customer is the Fairy Godmother! Even though she could magic these up herself, she told me hers never taste quite as good as what we make.
m

Remy_003_f_I guess she's throwing some sort of pumpkin party and wants some pumpkin-y meals for the event.
Ö

Remy_004_fwI think some <ActivityItem>Pumpkin Puffs</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Pumpkin Soup</ActivityItem> would be perfect.

Remy_005_f-What do you say? Are you up to the challenge?

Remy_007_fèAnd remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.

Remy_008_fbHey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.

Remy_009_fûRemember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.
å

Remy_016_f~She's asked for some "dreamy meals": <ActivityItem>Dream Fizz</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Dream Ice Cream</ActivityItem>.
q

Remy_010_fcBut the Fairy Godmother doesn't want the meals for herself. You'll have to ask her who they're for.
N

Remy_011_f@That Fairy Godmother ‚Äî always thinking of everyone else first.
N

Remy_012_f@Today, she asked for some <ActivityItem>Desserts</ActivityItem>.
j

Remy_013_f\I wonder who they're for...? The Fairy Godmother doesn't usually ask for things for herself.
