Elsa_000_f<Hello, {PlayerName}. Did your Watering Can uncover anything?
A

Elsa_001_f3I saw the Forgotten taking the Orb from the Pillar.
e

Elsa_002_fWOh... Well, I've spent a lot of time talking to Merlin about the magic in this Village.
c

Elsa_003_fUHe told me that the Pillars have protective charms on them to keep Dark Magic at bay.
à

Elsa_004_fzMaybe the Forgotten wanted to try using more dangerous kinds of magic, and the Pillar's protective aura was stopping that.
ï

Elsa_005_fÜElsa, there's something I need to tell you. The Forgotten... they're a part of me. Some kind of splinter of myself that I left behind.
‹

Elsa_006_fÕI see... Well, I know that magic can do things like that. Olaf is a part of me. And he's sweet and kind. But so is Marshmallow, a much larger snowman I created. He's... Let's just say he's very protective.
]

Elsa_007_fOSo if the Forgotten wanted to mess with Dark Magic... does that mean I did too?
>
Player_000_choice_000_f#I would never mess with Dark Magic.
@
Player_000_choice_001_f%It's the only thing that makes sense.
J
Player_000_choice_002_f/It definitely sounds like something I would do.
N

Elsa_008_f@Maybe it's not about Dark Magic. Maybe it's about... letting go.
G

Elsa_017_f9Then I think you'll find the rest of your answers inside.
`

Elsa_018_fRI'll go <Lore>see if there are any more memories inside the secret chamber</Lore>.
w

Elsa_009_fiMaybe that's the part of yourself that the Forgotten represents. The part that can't let go of something.
h

Elsa_010_fZBut... this would mean that the blizzard, the Forgetting... Could all of this be my fault?
>

Elsa_011_f0What? No, {PlayerName}... this isn't your fault.
Å

Elsa_012_fsTrust me. When it comes to starting magical blizzards that threaten to swallow up everything and everyone I love...
∞

Elsa_013_f°...I've got a little experience. Magic and emotions can make unintended things happen. The more you know about your magic, the more you'll be able to control it.
G

Elsa_014_f9What matters now is that you're here, trying to fix this.
B

Elsa_015_f4And I guess now we're one step closer to doing that.
à

Elsa_016_fzIn the memory, it looked like Olaf saw the Forgotten running off with the Orb, and he followed them to the secret chamber.
[

Elsa_019_fMJust because you WANT to do something doesn't mean that you would ever do it.
r

Elsa_020_fdWell, you do seem to be a curious person. Sometimes things call to you, and you just have to follow.
b

Elsa_021_fTMaybe that's the part of yourself that the Forgotten represents. All that curiosity.
'

Elsa_022_fBut wait. That's not all.
=

Elsa_023_f/Elsa, the Forgotten looked just like... like...


Elsa_024_f...me.


Elsa_025_f... Like you?
p

Elsa_026_fbThat's strange... Is it possible that the Forgotten is some part of yourself that you left behind?
4
Player_001_choice_000_fA part of myself...? How?
8
Player_001_choice_001_fElsa... is this all my fault?
/
Player_001_choice_002_fWe have to fix this.
v

Elsa_027_fhWell, I know that magic can make things like that happen. Olaf is a part of me. And he's sweet and kind.
r

Elsa_028_fdBut so is Marshmallow, a much larger snowman I created. He's... Let's just say he's very protective.
f

Elsa_029_fXMaybe the Forgotten is some piece of yourself that you need to find a way to understand.
>

Elsa_030_f0What? No, {PlayerName}... this isn't your fault.
Å

Elsa_031_fsTrust me. When it comes to starting magical blizzards that threaten to swallow up everything and everyone I love...

Elsa_032_f°...I've got a little experience. Magic and emotions can make unintended things happen. The more you know about your magic, the more you'll be able to control it.
K

Elsa_033_f=Yes. And I know you're the one who can do that, {PlayerName}.
