Scrooge_002_f"I managed to learn more about one!
L
Scrooge_003_f;It's some sort of <Lore>Machine that gardens for ya</Lore>!
!
Player_001_choice_000_fWHAT?!
"
Player_001_choice_001_fNO WAY.
,
Player_001_choice_002_fWay ahead of you.

Player_001_choice_003_fWhat's the catch?

Scrooge_004_fAye, it's quite remarkable!

Scrooge_007_fgI don't know where you're goin' to find all the <ActivityItem>ancient parts</ActivityItem> to build it!
m
Scrooge_008_f\Ancient parts... that's the sort of thing I'm always finding with my <Lore>Hourglass</Lore>!
Ö
Scrooge_009_ftWell then, why don't ya take these <ActivityItem>Ancient Blueprints</ActivityItem> and see what you can do with 'em!
