Scrooge_000_fqThank you kindly, {PlayerName}. Now, here's all you need to know to find the <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem>.
…
Scrooge_001_ftI hid it away in the Village before the Forgetting. So, I'm not so clear on the details, but I trust you'll find it.
w
Scrooge_008_ffI buried the scroll in a locked chest near a cave on Dazzle Beach, though I cannae remember which one.
ƒ
Scrooge_002_frAs for the key to open the chest, you'll have to fish that out from the pool in the Glade. The one with the ruins.

Scrooge_003_ffHappy searching, {PlayerName}! And thank you again for the <ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem>!
