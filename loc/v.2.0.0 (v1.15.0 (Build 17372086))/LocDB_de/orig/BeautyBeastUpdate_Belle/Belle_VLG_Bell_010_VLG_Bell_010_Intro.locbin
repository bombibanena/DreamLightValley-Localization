Of course.
A
Player_000_choice_001_f&Sorry, I'm already "booked" elsewhere.
R
Belle_002_fCWell, you see... when I came to your Valley, I had to pack lightly.
2
Belle_004_f#So, I could only bring a few books.
2
Belle_005_f#And I've already read most of them.
o
Belle_014_f`I'd like to read something new, so I asked Merlin if I could borrow from the Dreamlight Library.
p
Belle_007_faBut he said no. He explained that too many books have been borrowed in the past and not returned.
F
Player_002_choice_000_f+But the library should be open to everyone!
G
Player_002_choice_001_f,How many books have gone missing exactly...?
k
Player_002_choice_002_fPI know Merlin practically lives in there... but those books belong to all of us.
t
Belle_006_feMerlin agrees, but he's rather frustrated with the situation and doesn't want to lose any more books.
∫
Belle_010_f™I'd like to make sure that the Library reopens, so I was wondering if you could help me locate some of the missing <ActivityItem>Books</ActivityItem> and bring them back.
(
Belle_011_fI can help you with that.
ù
Belle_012_fçThat's wonderful! Thank you. Now, why don't I get half of the <ActivityItem>Books</ActivityItem> from the list, while you get the other half.
w
Belle_015_fhCould you <Lore>go see Goofy, Mirabel, Mr. McDuck, and Remy</Lore> and ask for their library books back?
:
Belle_008_f+Actually, a lot. Merlin is very frustrated.
q
Belle_013_fbI think he feels like it's his responsibility to watch over the books. And he's rather frustrated.
g
Belle_000_fXBonjour, {PlayerName}. Would you have time to help me with a small book-related problem?
)
Belle_001_fBooked... Oh, I like that.

Belle_003_f-If you do have time soon, please come see me.
