Belle_000_fa{PlayerName}, I've been thinking... If this were a story, you'd certainly be written as the hero.

Player_000_choice_000_fI'm no hero.

Player_000_choice_001_fDefinitely!

Player_000_choice_002_fI'm more of the storyteller.
q
Belle_001_fbI disagree. Besides, if you KNEW you were the hero, then it wouldn't be much of a story, would it?
E
Belle_002_f6Hmm... what kind of character do you think I would be?

Player_001_choice_000_fThe damsel in distress.

Player_001_choice_001_fYou're definitely the hero.

Belle_003_f‰Someone waiting around to be rescued? Oh, I don't think that's me at all. I'm quite capable of taking care of myself and rescuing others.
q
Belle_004_fbDo you think so? Well, I do enjoy adventures... and traveling to new places... and helping others!

Belle_005_fThank you, {PlayerName}.
z
Belle_006_fkThat's very kind. I've certainly learned a lot from my father, so I'd be happy to aspire to fill that role.
