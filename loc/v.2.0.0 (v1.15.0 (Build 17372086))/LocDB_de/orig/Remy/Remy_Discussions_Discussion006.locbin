&
Player_000_choice_000_fWhat about?

Player_000_choice_001_fA dangerous pastime.
@

Remy_001_f2About cooking. Of course, I'm always doing that...
e

Remy_003_fWBut this time I was thinking about the Night Thorns and how we need to get rid of them.

Remy_004_f)So... what if I found a way to cook them?
5
Player_000_choice_003_fI think they're poisonous.
@
Player_000_choice_004_f%I think they're mystically dangerous.

Player_000_choice_005_fI think they'd taste bad.

Remy_005_fœYou can cook some poisonous things in a way that makes them safe to eat. But I guess that would be too dangerous to try. I better give it some more thought.
k

Remy_006_f]Mystical, huh? That sounds a little beyond me. Guess I better not mess with the Night Thorns.

Remy_007_fƒYou'd be surprised at how bad some raw ingredients can taste. But sautÃ© them, add a little garlic, and they can totally transform.

Remy_002_f)Yeah. That's what my brother always says.
