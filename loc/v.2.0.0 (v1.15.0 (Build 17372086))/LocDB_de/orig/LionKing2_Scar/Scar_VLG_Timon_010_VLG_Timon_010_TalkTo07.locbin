Scar_000_fHi, Scar. You look... agitated.


Scar_018_fOh I do, do I?
[

Scar_004_fMI know what that insolent little Vanellope creature tried to leave in my den.
`

Scar_010_fRAnd... I know that you took care of it. I suppose a show of gratitude is in order.
e

Scar_020_fWKeeping the Villagers safe and happy is my number one priority... ALL of the Villagers.
D

Scar_021_f6I'll make sure nothing like this happens to you again.
'

Scar_022_fAnd I do appreciate that.


Scar_019_fWhat happened?
X

Scar_017_fJI'm certain that insolent little Vanellope creature has been spying on me.

Player_000_choice_000_fWhy do you think that?
A
Player_000_choice_001_f&Vanellope would never do such a thing!
M
Player_000_choice_002_f2She does give off a mischievous vibe, doesn't she?
I

Scar_002_f;I've seen her lurking about, like a predator stalking prey.
K

Scar_005_f=Must be strange for you to be on the other side of that, huh?
d

Scar_013_fVHardly. It's not as if the child could truly harm me. But she is exceedingly annoying.
z

Scar_014_flListen, I'll take care of whatever Vanellope is up to. Just... try not to get too worked up over this, okay?
=

Scar_015_f/Not to worry, {PlayerName}. I am imperturbable.
!

Scar_016_fSure you are, Scar.
E

Scar_003_f7Please. She has "bothersome brat" written all over her.

Scar_006_f"Don't be mean. Vanellope is sweet!


Scar_007_fUgh.
D

Scar_008_f6But you have a little mischief in you, too, don't you?
|

Scar_011_fn{PlayerName}, I am wickedly clever, cunning, ruthless, determined, perhaps mildly vengeful... but mischievous?
r

Scar_012_fdTo boil royalty such as me down to one simplistic, juvenile word is disrespect of the highest order.
