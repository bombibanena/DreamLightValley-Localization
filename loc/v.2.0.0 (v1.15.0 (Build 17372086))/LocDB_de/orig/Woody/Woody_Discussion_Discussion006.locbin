Woody_004_f~Tricky question. The answer is: Whatever games your kid likes best. Some toys are built for specific games. Checkers. Teatime.

Woody_005_flBut if you're a teatime doll and your kid likes superheroes? You've gotta be flexible. Find yourself a cape.

Woody_006_fÇWhenever you see someone, you freeze. That's instinct. Even when Buzz thought he was a Space Ranger, he still froze around humans.

Woody_007_fùBut it's also important to freeze in the right spot. Where your kid last left you is best. But if you can't get there, get somewhere you can easily be found.
