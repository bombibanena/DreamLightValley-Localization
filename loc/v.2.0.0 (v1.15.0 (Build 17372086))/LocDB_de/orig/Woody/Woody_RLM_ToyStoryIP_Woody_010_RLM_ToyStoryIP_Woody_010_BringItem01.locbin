Woody_004_fIBut we're still gonna need a couple more things to rebuild Bonnie's farm.

Woody_005_fWhat will we need?
h
Woody_000_fYWell, Bonnie drew these giant <ActivityItem>Yellow Daisies</ActivityItem> above the farm.

Woody_002_fLJust leave those to me. I'll <Lore>find Yellow Daisies in my Village</Lore>.
a
Woody_001_fRSounds good, partner! Oh, but we'll also need something to hold it all together...

Woody_006_fGThat could work. But Bonnie doesn't chew gum, so I doubt we'd find any.

Woody_009_f9Hold on, didn't you say you sent Buzz on a recon mission?

Woody_010_f&Maybe he's found something we can use.
J
Woody_011_f;Good idea! I'll go <Lore>talk to Buzz in my Village</Lore>.
Z
Woody_012_fKOkay. Then bring everything back to me, and I'll start putting it together.

Woody_007_f`I'm afraid the only string around here is my pull string, and I'm kinda attached to it. Heh-heh.
g
Woody_008_fXI'm afraid the only glue around here is preschool safe. It's not gonna be strong enough.
