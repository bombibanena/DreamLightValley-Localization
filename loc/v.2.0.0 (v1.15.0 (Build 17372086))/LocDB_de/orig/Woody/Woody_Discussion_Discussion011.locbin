Woody_000_f?Hey {PlayerName} â€” be a pal and settle a little disagreement.
E
Woody_001_f6Which is harder: ridin' a horse or flyin' a spaceship?
*
Player_000_choice_000_fRiding a horse.
.
Player_000_choice_001_fFlying a spaceship.
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$They're both hard in their own ways.
#
Woody_002_fExactly. You get it!
e
Woody_003_fVWhen you're ridin' a horse, you've gotta understand the horse, guide 'em, protect 'em.
O
Woody_004_f@You really have to get to know your steed. They're your partner.
?
Player_001_choice_000_f$Hm. Relationships ARE complicated...
;
Player_001_choice_001_f I guess it depends on the horse.
7
Player_001_choice_002_fWhat about... a space-horse?
3
Woody_005_f$Couldn't have said it better myself.
#
Woody_006_fY'know, that's fair.
B
Woody_007_f3And I'll bet it all depends on the spaceship too...
+
Woody_008_fWhy don't we call it a draw?
6
Woody_009_f'A space-horse? Have they got those now?
C
Woody_010_f4I'll have to ask Buzz. They must be sold separately.
T
Woody_011_fEWhat?! No, no, no! Spaceships are all just buttons and blinky lights.
o
Woody_012_f`Okay, fine. You MAY be right. But on a spaceship, all you've gotta do is push the right buttons.
