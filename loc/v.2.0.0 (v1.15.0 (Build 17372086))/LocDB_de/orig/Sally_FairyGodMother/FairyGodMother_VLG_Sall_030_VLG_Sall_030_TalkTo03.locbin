FairyGodMother_002_f`Hello, Fairy Godmother! Sally and I were hoping you might like to help us with a sewing project.

Player_000_choice_000_fIt would mean a lot to her.
4
Player_000_choice_001_fYou have the magic touch.
h
Player_000_choice_002_fMHer ideas were a little too different for Daisy and Minnie's current project.
a
FairyGodMother_004_fIOh, you're such a dear. Why, I'd be thrilled to lend a hand... or a wand!
:
FairyGodMother_007_f"She mentioned the idea of a quilt.
o
FairyGodMother_000_fWWhat a splendid project! But what sort of a quilt? Is there a pattern or a color theme?
?
Player_002_choice_000_f$Maybe... Dreamlight Valley-inspired?
9
Player_002_choice_001_fCan we magically find an idea?
H
Player_002_choice_002_f-She said a quilt "of dried cobwebs" to Daisy?
>
FairyGodMother_015_f&Yes, yes... I think that could work...
’
FairyGodMother_008_fzI know! A patchwork piece to bring back fond Valley memories. But for a quilt... well, we'll need cloth scraps, of course.
=
Player_001_choice_000_f"Where would we get scrap material?
.
Player_001_choice_001_fWe could ask Goofy!
7
Player_001_choice_002_fI could cut up some clothes?
Y
FairyGodMother_011_fANot to worry, {PlayerName}. My magic will handle the fabric part.
°
FairyGodMother_013_f—If you <Lore>bring me memorabilia of your special moments in the Valley</Lore>, I'll turn them into scraps of fabric that Sally and I can sew together.
X
FairyGodMother_016_f@Oh! Like an <Lore>ancient Crystal from the Mystical Cave</Lore>!
`
FairyGodMother_020_fHOr that feather of Donald's I found <Lore>in the Forest of Valor</Lore>.
f
FairyGodMother_018_fNAnd I had such a good time making some <Lore>Fruit Salad with Mickey</Lore>...
D
FairyGodMother_019_f,Precisely! Items full of wonderful memories!
:
FairyGodMother_017_f"Guess I'll start treasure hunting!
K
FairyGodMother_014_f3Our quilting has begun. We're off to have such fun!
p
FairyGodMother_010_fXGoofy sells fine pumpkins, but not fabric. Not to worry. I have some magic we might try.
b
FairyGodMother_012_fJGoodness, no, dear! I have some magic that will keep your wardrobe intact.
K
FairyGodMother_001_f3Hmm... Let me think... Magic... Dreamlight Magic...
¢
FairyGodMother_009_f‰Oh, my! How interesting. Though... I suppose that might not appeal to everyone. Yet, the idea of cloth from a unique source is marvelous!
a
FairyGodMother_003_fIMagic touch? Oh, (ha-ha), yes, I suppose I do. What did you have in mind?
x
FairyGodMother_006_f`Different and wonderful, I imagine. Just like Sally. Well, {PlayerName}, I would love to assist!
