@
Maleficent_003_f,And you managed to capture my pets. I see...
1
Maleficent_004_fPerhaps I underestimated you.
=
Maleficent_011_f)These "pets"... Where did they come from?
G
Maleficent_012_f3Just a bit of magic I obtained from the Lorekeeper.
)
Player_002_choice_000_fUm, excuse me?
?
Player_002_choice_002_f$You stole magic from the Lorekeeper?

Maleficent_005_fkAre you offended? Yes, I stole a bit of magic from the Lorekeeper, so I could bend this world to my desire.
8
Maleficent_007_f$You'll find that Hades did the same.
Q
Maleficent_008_f=That petulant fool. Someone really needs to keep him in line.

Player_003_choice_000_fYou're BOTH petulant.
2
Player_003_choice_001_fWhat you did was wrong.
W
Player_003_choice_002_f<Let's focus on fixing things. Not what happened in the past.

Maleficent_017_fSILENCE!
j
Maleficent_018_fVI have given you more allowances than any mortal has ever been granted in my presence.
E
Maleficent_019_f1But my patience has its limits. Do not test them.
=
Maleficent_023_f)Fine. Let's stick to the problem at hand.
W
Maleficent_006_fCWhat's it going to take to get you to give up your feud with Hades?
W
Maleficent_009_fCI suppose if Hades came groveling to me, begging for forgiveness...
7
Maleficent_010_f#I might find a way to tolerate him.
5
Maleficent_013_f!I've met Hades, over in Mythopia.
9
Maleficent_015_f%I'm sorry you've had the displeasure.
/
Player_004_choice_000_fHe's my kind of guy!
2
Player_004_choice_001_fHe's really not so bad.
5
Player_004_choice_002_fYou're right. He's a jerk.
R
Maleficent_026_f>Oh dear, I had hoped you were worthy of being my acquaintance.
v
Maleficent_016_fbThe thing is, he's not too thrilled with you either. I don't know if he'll be doing any groveling.
W
Maleficent_037_fCIn fact... he wants YOU to go to Mount Olympus to apologize to HIM.

Maleficent_038_f	He what?!
7
Maleficent_039_f#Ha. Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
2
Maleficent_040_fThe audacity of that imbecile!
N
Maleficent_041_f:So after all of that... neither of you are going to budge?
ã
Maleficent_042_fwI will not set foot outside this castle until he kneels before me and admits I am the most powerful being to ever live!
y
Maleficent_043_fe*sigh* ... I guess I'll have to go <Lore>talk to the Lorekeeper</Lore> to figure out what to do next.
è
Maleficent_032_f{But maybe if I could restore Mount Olympus for Hades... he'd feel more like an equal, and he might be willing to say sorry.
Ö
Maleficent_044_fqI highly doubt that will ever happen. But I suppose you have your work cut out for you if you intend to find out.
ì
Maleficent_045_fBecause I will not set foot outside this castle until he kneels before me and admits I am the most powerful being to ever live!
Y
Maleficent_046_fE*sigh* ... I guess I'll go <Lore>try to restore Mount Olympus</Lore>.
j
Maleficent_027_fVNo, {PlayerName}. He's worse than bad. He's a hopeless fool who thinks he's brilliant.
D
Maleficent_028_f0Well, at least you're a fine judge of character.
.
Maleficent_014_fI haven't found Hades yet.
X
Maleficent_029_fDHe must be hiding on Mount Olympus... or somewhere else in Mythopia.
/
Maleficent_030_fOh, do let him stay hidden.
D
Maleficent_033_f0I would. But we need his help to solve all this.
b
Maleficent_034_fNThen I shall be waiting here, in my castle, should you ever find the braggart.
u
Maleficent_035_faBring him to me when he's ready to apologize and admit I am the most powerful being to ever live!
f
Maleficent_036_fRThis isn't gonna be easy. I guess I'll go <Lore>look for Hades in Mythopia</Lore>.
G
Maleficent_020_f3Right... wrong... these are matters of perspective.
&
Maleficent_021_fI did what I must.
^
Maleficent_022_fJAren't you amusing? A mere mortal, trying to solve matters far beyond you.
