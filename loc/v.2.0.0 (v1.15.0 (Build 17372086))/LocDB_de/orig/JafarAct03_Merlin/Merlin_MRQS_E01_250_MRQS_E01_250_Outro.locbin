Merlin_000_f@{PlayerName}! You've done it! You have the Spark of Imagination!
,
Merlin_001_fNow, what happened to Jafar?
E
Merlin_002_f5I tricked him into trapping himself inside this lamp.
H
Player_000_choice_000_f-Guess he's not as smart as he thought he was.
3
Player_000_choice_001_fHis ego was his undoing.
C
Player_000_choice_002_f(He was almost too clever for it. Almost.
=
Merlin_003_f-Ha-ha! That's splendid! How ingenious of you!
G
Merlin_004_f7Now, we must decide what's to be done with the Spark...
E
Player_001_choice_000_f*It's too powerful. We should lock it away.
?
Player_001_choice_001_f$I want to use it to help the Valley.
G
Player_001_choice_002_f,Maybe we could destroy it, once and for all.
N
Player_001_choice_003_f3I want to use it to fulfill my every whim and wish!
é
Merlin_005_f~Well, the ancient civilization that once ruled Eternity Isle must have thought the same. They locked it away in those ruins...
K
Merlin_006_f;...but that didn't stop Jafar from getting his hands on it.
@
Merlin_007_f0You know, there is something else we could do...

Merlin_008_fWhat's that?
/
Merlin_009_fShare the Spark. With everyone.
ù
Merlin_010_fåIts power is too much for one person when it's an object you can hold in your hands. But if you scattered it throughout the entire Valley...
d
Merlin_011_fT...it could bring a bit of magic into everyone's day, and pose no danger for anyone.
4
Player_002_choice_000_fEveryone wins! I love it!
.
Player_002_choice_001_fThis feels right...
J
Player_002_choice_002_f/*sigh* So you're telling me I have to share it?

Merlin_012_f
Precisely!
F
Merlin_013_f6The things we create together... the ideas we share...
ñ
Merlin_014_fÖThey're the only things more powerful than the passage of time. Friendship, love, and creativity are what truly last for an eternity.
U
Merlin_015_fEHeh. It's a paradox, isn't it? We only get to keep what we give away.
2
Merlin_016_f"All right... so how do we do this?
q
Merlin_017_faJust hold the Spark... and make a wish with your heart to share it with all of Dreamlight Valley.
K
Merlin_018_f;There is just one thing I need to do with it first, though.
F
Merlin_019_f6Don't worry. It's not for me. I need to help a friend.
V
Merlin_025_fFI'll gather everyone at once. <Lore>Meet me outside the palace!</Lore>
$
Merlin_020_fI assure you, it is!
i
Merlin_021_fYDon't sound so disappointed, {PlayerName}. Haven't you learned anything from all of this?
Ç
Merlin_022_frA fine aspiration indeed. Though I'm afraid such immense power can corrupt even those with the best of intentions.
]
Merlin_023_fMI doubt that we could destroy it even if we wished to. It's far too powerful.
ñ
Merlin_024_fÖWhat?! Didn't you see what happened when Jafar tried to do exactly that? The Spark's magic won't work when used towards selfish ends.
