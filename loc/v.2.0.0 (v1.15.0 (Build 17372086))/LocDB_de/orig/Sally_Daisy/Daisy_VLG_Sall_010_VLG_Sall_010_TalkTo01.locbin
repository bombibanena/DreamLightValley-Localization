Daisy_002_f$Hey Daisy, can we talk for a moment?
9
Daisy_003_f*Of course! What do you want to talk about?

Daisy_004_fRomance!
9
Daisy_005_f*Oooh, I'm always happy to talk about that!
Z
Daisy_006_fKSo I'm trying to help Sally and Jack get comfortable with each other again.
m
Daisy_007_f^They were apart for a while, and I think they need a little help to get back on the same page.
;
Daisy_008_f,I understand. Did you have anything in mind?
J
Daisy_010_f;Minnie suggested that I make some treats for them to share.
k
Daisy_016_f\Well, that's a great start! As long as it's the kind of treat that Jack and Sally both like.
d
Daisy_017_fUHmm, not sure about that... I guess gingerbread isn't the most Halloween-y of treats.
b
Daisy_018_fSWell, there's an easy way to fix that â€” make the cookies in the shape of a skull!
°
Daisy_009_f But a date needs more than just snacks. You could... <Lore>decorate with Halloween items</Lore> or even <Lore>include a variety of Halloween-themed food</Lore>!

Daisy_020_f1Great ideas, Daisy. I'll get started on that now!
;
Daisy_011_f,No, you're the first Villager I came to see.
[
Daisy_012_fLWell, aren't you smart? Coming to the best advice-giver in the Valley first!
}
Daisy_013_fnNow, let me think... Oh, I know! You could give them something they'll both like that they can share together.
M
Daisy_014_f>And for Jack and Sally, it should involve frightening imagery!

Daisy_015_f'Like a skull, or something Halloween-y.
š
Daisy_001_fŠAnd that can apply to everything! You could <Lore>decorate with Halloween items</Lore> or even <Lore>include Halloween-themed food</Lore>!
Y
Daisy_019_fJPerfect! Thanks, Daisy. I'll <Lore>see what Minnie has to say next</Lore>.
