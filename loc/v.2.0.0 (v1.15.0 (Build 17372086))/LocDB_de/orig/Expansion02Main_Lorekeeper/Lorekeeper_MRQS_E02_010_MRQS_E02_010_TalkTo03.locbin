Lorekeeper_000_f Ahhhh... that feels MUCH better.
B
Lorekeeper_001_f.My pages were beginning to get all crumpled...
G
Lorekeeper_002_f3All my magic was seeping away. *cough cough* Agh...
6
Player_000_choice_000_fWhat more can I do to help?
E
Player_000_choice_001_f*I've never met a book that was ill before.
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$I fixed you up. Now can you help us?
I
Lorekeeper_003_f5Well, no problem can be fixed until it is understood.
2
Player_001_choice_000_fWhat is the Neverafter?
0
Player_001_choice_001_fWhat caused the feud?
8
Player_001_choice_002_fWho are Maleficent and Hades?
G
Player_001_choice_003_f,This is a real mess! How can I fix all this?
c
Lorekeeper_004_fOAnd there's no better way to understand a problem than by listening to a story.
d
Lorekeeper_008_fPSit back, while I regale you with the tale of how this land fell into disrepair.
?
Lorekeeper_011_f+A tale that YOU helped restore to my pages.
Ä
Lorekeeper_012_fl<Lore>The Storybook Vale...</Lore> this land... is the place in your heart where your favorite stories live.
M
Lorekeeper_013_f9A world <Lore>sewn together from fables and myths</Lore>.
X
Lorekeeper_014_fDOnce upon a time, this land hung in the sky above Dreamlight Valley.
X
Lorekeeper_021_fDOnly you can stop <Lore>the Neverafter<Lore> and set this all right.
Y
Lorekeeper_022_fEIt's what I've taken to calling the phenomena sweeping over the Vale.
|
Lorekeeper_023_fhInk bleeding from the land itself... strange happenings... the pages of my stories becoming scattered...
R
Lorekeeper_024_f>We must fix it, before it robs us all of a happily ever after.
@
Lorekeeper_043_f,This is a real mess! How can I fix all this?
0
Lorekeeper_033_fOh, it will be quite simple.
g
Lorekeeper_034_fSYou must <Lore>bring Hades and Maleficent together and end their squabbling</Lore>!
;
Player_003_choice_000_f Simple?! That sounds impossible.
5
Player_003_choice_001_fUh, easier said than done.
Y
Player_003_choice_002_f>I'll lock them in a room together and FORCE them to get along.
]
Lorekeeper_035_fIOh, {PlayerName}, nothing is impossible here. This is the Storybook Vale.
h
Lorekeeper_038_fTBefore you can bring those two together, you must <Lore>clean up around here</Lore>.
ç
Lorekeeper_040_fyThe way is blocked by all that ink gushing up from the ground. Perhaps <Lore>Merida</Lore> can be of some help with that.
ƒ
Lorekeeper_041_fØI ask only one other thing... If you come across more of those <ActivityItem>Snippets</ActivityItem> on your journeys, {PlayerName}, do <Lore>bring them back to me</Lore>, eh?
u
Lorekeeper_042_faI have countless stories that need to be put back together again before I can regain my strength.
g
Lorekeeper_036_fSOf course, {PlayerName}. It's always easier to tell a story than it is to live one.
à
Lorekeeper_037_ftI wish you the best of luck with that approach. Do watch out for any fireballs they start hurling around, won't you?
i
Lorekeeper_025_fUWho can say? Maleficent holds great resentment, and the merest slight can enrage her.
a
Lorekeeper_026_fMAnd Hades... It is no play on mere words to say that he's a bit of a hothead.
_
Lorekeeper_027_fKPut the two of them in a room together and the consequences are disastrous!
á
Lorekeeper_028_fsYou've never heard of them? Why, Maleficent proclaims herself the "Mistress of All Evil." You'd best beware of her.
ü
Lorekeeper_029_fäAnd Hades is a mythological miser who rules over the Underworld. He can be a bit tricky, but he's not nearly as clever as he thinks he is.
@
Player_002_choice_000_f%Uhhh, maybe I should just avoid them.
:
Player_002_choice_001_fI'll watch my back around them.
5
Player_002_choice_002_fPfft. They don't scare me.
n
Lorekeeper_030_fZYou are wise to be heedful. But to save the Vale, you won't be able to avoid them forever.
V
Lorekeeper_031_fBYes, sooner or later, you must confront them, but take great care.
Y
Lorekeeper_032_fEBest be sure you know the difference between bravery and foolishness.
~
Lorekeeper_005_fjNo, I suppose even in Dreamlight Valley, you don't come across that often, do you? Hehehe‚Äî *cough cough*
W
Lorekeeper_006_fCNow, I've no idea how long I have before my magic departs me again.
à
Lorekeeper_007_ftAh, straight to the point. I respect that. Cutting through the muddle with only a few words is a rare talent indeed!
X
Lorekeeper_009_fDI shall not waste your time. Let me tell you why I brought you here.
