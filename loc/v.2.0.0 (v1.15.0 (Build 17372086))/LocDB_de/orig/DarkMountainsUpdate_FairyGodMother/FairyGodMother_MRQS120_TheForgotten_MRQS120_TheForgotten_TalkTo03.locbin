Player_000_choice_001_fWhat do I do now?

Player_000_choice_002_fWho built all this?

FairyGodMother_004_fêThe <ActivityItem>Orb of Remembrance</ActivityItem> is on that pedestal in the center of the room. Oh, but I'm afraid its power has grown dim...

FairyGodMother_005_fkIf we're to restore it, we must find the <ActivityItem>Memories</ActivityItem> the Forgotten has scattered.

FairyGodMother_006_fSo how do we do that?

FairyGodMother_011_fMWell, each Memory holds some whisper of the virtues that have been forgotten.

FairyGodMother_010_f`And many are already here to be found. <Lore>Just gather the Memories you see all around!</Lore>
