FairyGodMother_001_f:You've returned! Splendid! Now, what did you learn inside?
c
Player_000_fSIt was so strange. I felt everything the Forgotten must have felt. The Forgotten...
I
Player_000_choice_000_f....stopped being able to share their feelings.
=
Player_000_choice_001_f"...lost their excitement for life.
F
Player_000_choice_002_f+...seemed like just a moody teenager to me.
Ç
FairyGodMother_002_fjThe Forgotten was so sad and lonely and frustrated... but they couldn't seem to talk about it with anyone.
ê
FairyGodMother_003_fxAh, yes... Sometimes the most painful thing to have is a friendly ear when what you want is to be sure no one will hear.
j
FairyGodMother_014_fRI fear that the key to stopping the Forgotten lies in another of these Memories...
i
FairyGodMother_007_fQ...but do you feel, at least, that you understand the Forgotten a bit better now?

Player_001_choice_000_fYes.

Player_001_choice_001_fNo.
Ø
FairyGodMother_008_fñThe Forgotten never asked to be stuck here. If I felt that lonely and frustrated... I guess I might do some of the things the Forgotten has done, too.
è
FairyGodMother_010_fwMany would. But just because we can understand the Forgotten doesn't mean we must agree with the path they walked down.
p
FairyGodMother_015_fXLet's hope that the next Memory holds the key to finding the Forgotten and helping them.
d
FairyGodMother_016_fLNow, {PlayerName}, <Lore>follow me</Lore>. There's so much more here to see.
t
FairyGodMother_009_f\I thought that if the Forgotten was going to hide a Memory, it would be something... bigger.
\
FairyGodMother_011_fDBut that wasn't any big trauma or sadness. It was just... a bad day.
é
FairyGodMother_012_fvPerhaps the moments that define us... the moments we most want to forget... don't always look the way we would expect.
m
FairyGodMother_004_fUIt was such a beautiful day in the Valley... but everything just seemed like a chore.
p
FairyGodMother_013_fXOh dear. It's sad indeed when what once brought joy... now only serves to vex and annoy.
á
FairyGodMother_005_foThe Forgotten was so moody and annoyed with everything! I hope that's not what I was like when I was younger...
C
FairyGodMother_006_f+Well, the Forgotten IS a part of you, dear.
