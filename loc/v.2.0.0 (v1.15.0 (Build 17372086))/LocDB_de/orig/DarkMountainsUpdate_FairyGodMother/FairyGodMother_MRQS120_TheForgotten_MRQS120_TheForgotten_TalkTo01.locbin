FairyGodMother_001_fKOh my. Is it really...? It couldn't be...? Oh, let me have a look at you...
C
FairyGodMother_004_f+... {PlayerName}? Oh, it is you, isn't it?!
;
Player_000_choice_000_f You must be the Fairy Godmother!
@
Player_000_choice_001_f%I'm here to help. What happened here?
>
Player_000_choice_002_f#I don't know how to be anyone else!
,
FairyGodMother_005_fWhy, yes, of course!
1
Player_002_choice_000_fWhat's the Dreamscape?
I
Player_002_choice_001_f.What sorts of Memories did the Forgotten hide?
9
Player_002_choice_002_fSo how do we get the Orb back?
q
FairyGodMother_021_fYNow, where is that wand? I... oh, I was sure I... I... Oh dear. I'm holding it, aren't I?
£
FairyGodMother_023_fäHeh-heh-heh. Well, then, I suppose that's one problem solved, isn't it? And now that you're here, perhaps, together, we can solve another.
c
FairyGodMother_009_fKOh, but let me get one more look at you... It's been far too long, my dear.
[
FairyGodMother_006_fC... It really is you, isn't it? And not that... that shadow of you?
M
FairyGodMother_017_f5Shadow of me...? Are you talking about the Forgotten?
°
FairyGodMother_011_fàYes, but now I'm certain that it's you! What a relief. You see, I've been trying to solve a magical conundrum the Forgotten left behind.
µ
FairyGodMother_012_fúLong ago, the Forgotten stole the <ActivityItem>Orb of Remembrance</ActivityItem> and hid it, along with some lost Memories, in <Lore>the Dreamscape</Lore>.
Å
FairyGodMother_024_fiOh, you may not know its name, but you've been there before... nearly every time you've closed your eyes.
õ
FairyGodMother_025_fÇ<Lore>The Dreamscape</Lore> is the place between dreams and the waking world. The rules there... well, they're a bit out of order.
y
FairyGodMother_026_faAnd it's a fine place for hiding things. Such as an Orb. Or perhaps Memories you'd rather forget.
t
FairyGodMother_028_f\I'm afraid I haven't the faintest idea. That's one of the reasons I was so happy to see YOU!
m
FairyGodMother_029_fUIt seems to me the Forgotten would want to forget the same sorts of things you might.
ù
FairyGodMother_030_fÑAs for me... well, I'm afraid I don't need a Dreamscape or magic spell to forget things. Heh-heh... I seem to do that all on my own.
u
FairyGodMother_031_f]That's why I always tie my cape on, you know. Otherwise, I'd never remember where I'd put it!
É
FairyGodMother_032_fkWell, that's what I've been trying to do here all along... but every spell I've tried simply hasn't worked.
|
FairyGodMother_033_fdYou mean... you've been in this Pumpkin House the whole time, trying to figure this out on your own?
K
FairyGodMother_034_f3Yes. But I'm afraid I've only managed to bumble it.
ö
FairyGodMother_035_fÅThe Forgotten has hidden the door to the Dreamscape behind a powerful illusion. And no matter what I do, I can't seem to lift it.
ã
FairyGodMother_036_fsOh, but now you're here! Your magic... it's just like the Forgotten's! Perhaps if we combined our magic together...
Z
Player_003_choice_000_f?I'm on it! One illusion-dispelling enchantment coming right up!
Q
Player_003_choice_002_f6Magic and me... we don't get along. Try asking Merlin?
ç
FairyGodMother_038_fuThere's nothing in the world I admire more than someone who delights in their duties and doesn't see them as a chore!
∏
FairyGodMother_041_füNow, before the Night Thorns parted me from the rest of the Village, I managed to grab a handful of spellbooks. One enchantment seems to hold the most promise.
í
FairyGodMother_042_fzWould you be a dear and gather some <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem> for it? I'll take care of the rest.
¢
FairyGodMother_043_fâ<Lore>Just meet me back here once you've found it.</Lore> After all... what's lost must be found again. And on you, I know we can depend!
l
FairyGodMother_039_fTMerlin! Oh, I do miss my old friend. We were parted by the Night Thorns so long ago.
â
FairyGodMother_040_fqBut I'm afraid before that, even Merlin wasn't able to lift this enchantment. We need your talents, {PlayerName}.
k
FairyGodMother_019_fSWell, that's a rather long story. But first, I'm afraid I've misplaced something...
b
FairyGodMother_020_fJAnd there's no one I'd rather you be! For you really are quite dear to me.
