Remy_003_fšI'm helping Sally build a <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem>, and we need some <ActivityItem>Vegetable Trimmings</ActivityItem> to get things going.

Remy_004_f5Do you have any that we could take off of your hands?


Remy_005_fAbsolutely!

Remy_006_fLDon't get me wrong, {PlayerName} â€” I do my best to reduce food waste here.

Remy_007_f`But even at my most efficient, I still end up with piles of rinds, skins, and produce trimmings.

Player_000_choice_001_f)They're... not already rotting, are they?

Remy_010_fOThere are actually a lot of things you can do with potato skins in the kitchen.

Remy_012_f5But these carrot skins and other stuff are all yours.
