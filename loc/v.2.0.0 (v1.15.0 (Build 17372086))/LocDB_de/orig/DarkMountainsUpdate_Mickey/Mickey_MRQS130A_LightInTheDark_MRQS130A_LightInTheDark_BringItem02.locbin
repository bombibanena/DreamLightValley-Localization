Mickey_005_fF{PlayerName}! All my memories about that book... I'm remembering them!
[
Mickey_006_fKYou and me... When you were just a little kid, we'd read the book together.
v
Mickey_007_ffAt first, I'd read it to you. And then one day, all of a sudden, you were old enough to read it to me.
c
Mickey_008_fSOh, and sometimes, we'd just make up our own stories to go along with the pictures.
/
Mickey_009_fI wish I could remember this...
­
Mickey_010_fœIt's a pretty special book. Lots of stories about brave heroics and evil villains. And everything comes out right just in time for the "happily ever after."
G
Player_000_choice_000_f,Maybe we can read it together again someday.
A
Player_000_choice_001_f&I wish things were really that simple.
I
Player_000_choice_002_f.Sounds kind of boring. Needs some more action.
M
Mickey_011_f=Aw, I'd love that! We haven't read together since... since...
t
Mickey_012_fdHey, now that I think about it, the last time we read this together was right before the Forgetting.
V
Mickey_013_fF... But... gosh, that wasn't really you, was it? It was the Forgotten.
K
Mickey_014_f;They... they left the book with me. They seemed pretty mad.
L
Mickey_015_f<But I think deep down, they were really sad about something.
I
Mickey_016_f9Gee, {PlayerName}, I hope you can help the Forgotten out.
Z
Mickey_017_fJMickey, the storybook... the magic coming off of it is stronger than ever.
\
Mickey_018_fLYou've done a lot to help. Now I'll do my part to try to save the Forgotten.
Z
Mickey_019_fJWelp, I guess if life was always easy, we wouldn't need stories, would we?
›
Mickey_020_fŠBut hey, now that I think about it, that's just what you said to me the last time we read this book together. Right before the Forgetting.
z
Mickey_021_fjOh, don't worry. There's lots of action. There's even one story where a hero pulls a sword out of a stone!
