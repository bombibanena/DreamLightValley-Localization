MotherGothel_000_fESo... how are you feeling about that, uh... magic moment with Merlin?
#
MotherGothel_001_fMagical?! Ha!
~
MotherGothel_002_fhThat windbag's attitude only proved to show how unappreciated I am here. Why, he seemed almost offended!
/
Player_000_choice_000_fIt's a crying shame!
M
Player_000_choice_001_f2Have you tried doing anything we could appreciate?
:
Player_000_choice_002_fNo need to get angry at Merlin.
n
MotherGothel_003_fXFinally, someone understands! Merlin should have been thrilled to be seen in my company.
m
MotherGothel_012_fWUgh. Fine. I'll be a tad more charitable upon our next meeting. But no more than a tad.
 
MotherGothel_013_f
Excellent!
Y
MotherGothel_004_fCWell, Merlin's not the most sociable guy. Don't take it personally.
W
MotherGothel_005_fAIn fact â€” he might have been intimidated by your wit and charm.
l
MotherGothel_006_fVVery perceptive, {PlayerName}... I suppose anyone would be intimidated, wouldn't they?
O
MotherGothel_007_f9Poor Merlin was likely dazzled and not thinking straight.
A
MotherGothel_008_f+In any case... this was all WALLÂ·E's idea.
P
MotherGothel_009_f:Really? Perhaps I underestimated the little rolling crate.

MotherGothel_010_f I'll have to keep my eye on him.
k
MotherGothel_011_fUWell, since you're feeling more cheerful, can you let bygones be bygones with Merlin?
™
MotherGothel_014_f‚Gracing you with my presence should be more than enough! Why, Merlin ought to be flattered that I'd even give him the time of day.
i
MotherGothel_015_fSAngry? He's not worth getting angry over. I'm merely appalled at his lack of taste.
