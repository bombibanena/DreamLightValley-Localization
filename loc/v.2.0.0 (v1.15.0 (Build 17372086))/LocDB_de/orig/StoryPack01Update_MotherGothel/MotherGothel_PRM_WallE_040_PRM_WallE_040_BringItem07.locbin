MotherGothel_000_f!Mother Gothel... we need to talk.
8
MotherGothel_001_f"Why, {PlayerName}, whatever about?
<
MotherGothel_002_f&WALLÂ·E and I found this empty vial...
'
MotherGothel_003_fYours, I presume?
+
MotherGothel_004_fA presumption indeed!
.
Player_000_choice_000_fSo, it's not yours?
7
Player_000_choice_001_fCome on; it has to be yours!
9
Player_000_choice_002_fDo you know who it belongs to?
L
MotherGothel_005_f6Why would there possibly be a fuss over an empty vial?
3
MotherGothel_006_fYou're being awfully evasive.
K
MotherGothel_007_f5Come now, {PlayerName}; a lady must have her secrets.
†
MotherGothel_008_fpWell, it's less about the vial than what was supposed to be in that same area. WALLÂ·E's plant has gone missing.
A
MotherGothel_009_f+Oh, you're worried about THAT little thing?
-
MotherGothel_010_fWhy didn't you say so?!
F
Player_001_choice_000_f+I tried, but you were being really evasive!
1
Player_001_choice_001_fI... uh... Never mind.
H
Player_001_choice_002_f-You're right: I should have been more direct.
:
MotherGothel_011_f$Hmmm, and whose fault is that, dear?
*
MotherGothel_020_fWhat happened to it?
Q
MotherGothel_021_f;Well, I could tell you... if you do something for me first.
E
Player_002_choice_000_f*Why am I not surprised you want something?
(
Player_002_choice_001_fFair is fair.
9
Player_002_choice_002_fWhat if I say "pretty please"?
,
MotherGothel_012_fSo, you saw the plant?
c
MotherGothel_013_fMI did indeed! My keen senses immediately detected something special about it.

MotherGothel_014_fAnd?!
0
MotherGothel_015_fOoh, someone's in a hurry.
¶
MotherGothel_016_fŸ*sigh* Fine. I brought the plant to Ursula, and she helped me examine it with a number of arcane techniques that I'm sure would be beyond your comprehension...

MotherGothel_017_f...
?
MotherGothel_018_f)But the pathetic little weed was useless.
[
MotherGothel_019_fESimply full of storybook magic, a trite and weak form of enchantment.
O
MotherGothel_022_f9Because you understand how the world works, {PlayerName}.
/
MotherGothel_023_fOK, OK, what do you want?
n
MotherGothel_024_fXWell, I used some rather precious ingredients trying to bring that plant back to health.
S
MotherGothel_025_f=If you bring me replacements... you'll have your information.
S
MotherGothel_026_f=Really? Do you want me to brew up a whole potion for you too?
q
MotherGothel_027_f[And trust you to do it correctly? Hardly. I'd much rather rely on Ursula's skills for that.
À
MotherGothel_028_f©Bring me <ActivityItem>Seaweed</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Cucumbers</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Sunflowers</ActivityItem>, and I'll tell you where the plant is.
(
MotherGothel_029_fHow mature of you!
Y
MotherGothel_030_fCOh, you can't possibly be serious! ... Wait, you are? Well, then...

MotherGothel_031_fNo.
,
MotherGothel_032_fThat's what I thought.
B
MotherGothel_033_f,At least you can admit your faults, darling.
