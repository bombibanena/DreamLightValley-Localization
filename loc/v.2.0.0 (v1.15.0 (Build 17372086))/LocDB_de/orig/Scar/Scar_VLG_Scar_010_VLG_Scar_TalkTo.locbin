Scar_000_fNNow, see? That wasn't SO difficult, was it? Even a warthog could have done it.
U

Scar_002_fGI suppose I should tell you the reason for my foul mood. It's simple...
T

Scar_017_fFI'm famished. There's scarcely any prey for me to eat in this Village.
Q

Scar_016_fCOf course, I did see one of your plump, feathery neighbors about...
C

Scar_001_f5But I presume you'd mind if I feasted on one of them.

Player_000_choice_000_fYes! I'd mind a lot.

Player_000_choice_001_f Scar. They're friends, not food.

Scar_011_f=No, no. I meant we could get Remy to help make you some food!
V

Scar_009_fHUgh. I remember the nauseating meals he made back before the Forgetting.

Scar_010_fPI hope, for his sake, he's improved. I'm not above eating a rodent if I have to.
P

Scar_018_fBI'll go talk to Remy. You just stay here and... don't eat anybody.

Scar_007_f]Perhaps your little kitty cats do, but I would need a fish meal fit for a lion! I'm famished.

Scar_008_fmOh, you can't be serious. I'm already famished. Wasting away. Grass and leaves are no nourishment for a lion.

Scar_004_f0If you insist. But I must have something to eat.
