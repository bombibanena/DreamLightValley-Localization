Scar_011_f\{PlayerName}, I have a little matter to discuss with you regarding my territory. Do join me.

Player_001_choice_000_fWhat seems to be the problem?
8
Player_001_choice_001_fI'll take care of this later.

Scar_000_f[Tell me, have you taken time from your "oh-so-busy" schedule to explore the Sunlit Plateau?
X

Scar_007_fJWait ‚Äî what am I saying? You never stray far from the safe and familiar.
h

Scar_004_fZWell, if you HAD bothered, you'd know that it's absolutely littered with wildebeest bones.
:
Player_000_choice_000_fCan't you remove them yourself?
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$What happened to the wildebeests...?
C
Player_000_choice_003_f(Scar... Did you eat all the wildebeests?
[

Scar_008_fMIf I could, I wouldn't be bothering with you. But since I can't, here we are.
Ü

Scar_003_fxIt wasn't such a problem before you decided to go away. You were very good at digging out the bones and removing them...
^

Scar_006_fPOf course, your <ActivityItem>Royal Shovel</ActivityItem> was sharper back then.
å

Scar_020_f~I seem to recall it had something to do with that bombastic Scrooge McDuck. He had some manner of making your Shovel stronger.
|

Scar_015_fnSounds good. I'll go talk to Mr. McDuck about making my Shovel stronger so we can clean up the Sunlit Plateau.


Scar_012_fI couldn't say...
Å

Scar_005_fsBut that is not the point, {PlayerName}. The point is that most of the Plateau is unusable for me ‚Äî ahem, for us.
~

Scar_001_fpIf I were gorging myself on wildebeests, do you really think I'd need to ask that rodent to procure food for me?
j

Scar_016_f\There have never been wildebeests on the Sunlit Plateau... but there have always been bones.
<

Scar_017_f.Somehow, they simply appear from time to time.


Scar_018_fOn my honor.
g

Scar_019_fYHm. That's weird... but I guess a lot of things about Dreamlight Valley are pretty weird.
Q

Scar_002_fC*sigh* And I'll be here, awaiting your mere morsels of benevolence.
