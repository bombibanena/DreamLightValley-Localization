Mickey_002_f-Oh boy, {PlayerName}, do I have news for you!
z
Mickey_003_fjI opened up my mailbox this morning and found a sparkly purple envelope addressed to both Minnie and me...
9
Mickey_004_f)Sparkly? Purple? Who was the letter from?
L
Mickey_006_f<Our pal Daisy Duck! I knew it the second I saw the envelope.
Ž
Mickey_001_f~She left the Village to investigate the Forgetting. Daisy said getting to the bottom of it was more important than anything...
]
Mickey_017_fM...and that she'd be back with the biggest news story the Valley's ever seen!
+
Player_000_fSo what did the letter say?
/
Player_000_choice_000_fShe sounds so brave!
,
Player_000_choice_001_fIs she in danger?
'
Player_000_choice_002_fIs she lost?

Mickey_009_f}She sure is. And her letter says she's found out something big about the Forgetting, and she's ready to return to the Valley!
¥
Mickey_012_f”She wrote ahead to ask if we could make sure <Lore>her House is in great shape</Lore>. Gosh, I can't blame her. She's been on one LONG camping trip!
@
Player_001_choice_000_f%I'll set up Daisy's House right away!
B
Player_001_choice_001_f'Extended camping trip? Sounds like fun!
D
Player_001_choice_002_f)Who needs camping when you have the mall?
.
Mickey_011_fHot dog! Thanks, {PlayerName}!
Z
Mickey_015_fJLet me know if you need any help <Lore>getting Daisy's House ready</Lore>.
]
Mickey_000_fMWelp, I'm sure you and Daisy'll have plenty to talk about when she gets back.
Ž
Mickey_014_f~Actually, Daisy likes shopping almost as much as she likes investigations and adventure! You two'll have plenty to talk about.
«
Mickey_010_fšNo, nothing like that. Her letter said she found out something about the Forgetting during her adventures, and now she's ready to come back to the Valley.
^
Mickey_008_fNNo, nothing like that. In fact, she's on her way back! It's all in her letter.
E
Mickey_005_f5But Minnie's still missing... Who's sending her mail?
Š
Mickey_007_fzIt's from our best pal, Daisy Duck. She wouldn't know that Minnie's disappeared because Daisy's been away for a long time.
