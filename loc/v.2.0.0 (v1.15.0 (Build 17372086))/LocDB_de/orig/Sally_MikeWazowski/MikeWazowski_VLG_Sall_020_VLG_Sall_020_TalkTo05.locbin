MikeWazowski_025_fBut more importantly...
O
MikeWazowski_003_f9...your auto-mat's broken! I'm stuck and I can't get out!
(
Player_000_choice_000_f... Auto-mat?
1
Player_000_choice_001_fDo you need some help?
0
Player_000_choice_002_fYou're not a critter!
T
MikeWazowski_004_f>Yeah? An automated food delivery machine? What do you call it?
1
MikeWazowski_009_fThat's... not what this is.
C
MikeWazowski_010_f-Hold on a sec; let me get you out of there...

MikeWazowski_011_f'Ahh, much better. Thanks, {PlayerName}!
‚
MikeWazowski_012_flSo, can you explain why you were nabbed trying to get into Sally's <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem>?
M
MikeWazowski_013_f7Who said anything about compost? I'm here for the food!
v
MikeWazowski_014_f`I was minding my own business when I picked up the delectable scent of some five-star seasoning!

Player_001_choice_000_fYou're... EATING the compost?
8
Player_001_choice_001_fSmells kinda like dirt to me.
1
Player_001_choice_002_fI should have known...
G
MikeWazowski_020_f1You mean the seasoning. And yeah. Why wouldn't I?
†
MikeWazowski_015_fpIt's clearly the best flavoring available in the Valley. Though I have no idea why it was completely unattended.
o
MikeWazowski_016_fYIt was just sittin' there, so I thought I'd help myself. But then... well, I was trapped.
b
MikeWazowski_017_fLOkay, I think I see the problem here. This is not a dispenser for seasoning!
›
MikeWazowski_018_f„... You feeling all right, {PlayerName}? There is clearly fabulous seasoning inside that container, and I'm NOT supposed to eat it?!
J
MikeWazowski_019_f4Oof, okay, maybe Sally should explain this to you...
^
MikeWazowski_021_fHYes, very dirt forward! And yet, with notes of rot and vegetable miasma.
D
MikeWazowski_022_f.I agree! It's like you don't know me at all...
O
MikeWazowski_005_f9Oh no, clearly I want to stay here until the end of time.
'
MikeWazowski_006_fYes, I need help!
 
MikeWazowski_007_f
