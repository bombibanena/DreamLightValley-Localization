Buzz_003_fGreat news, cadet!

Buzz_007_fáThere are only a few things left to do. Let's make sure our headquarters appears inviting and that our uniforms are in top-notch shape.

Buzz_008_f‹I suggest a proper landing pad for our <ActivityItem>Ship</ActivityItem>. <ActivityItem>Asphalt</ActivityItem> should work. And a <ActivityItem>Blue Balloon Arch</ActivityItem> for the ceremony... I'll leave that to you.

Buzz_009_fÑOnce the items are complete, let's put them around the RV... I uh, I mean, Star Command... so it's ready for the welcoming ceremony.

Buzz_004_fÅGood job, cadet. There's a special role for each of them with Star Command, and I'm sure you let them know just what it would be.
