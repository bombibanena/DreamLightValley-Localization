Player_000_choice_001_fWhy were you fighting?
K
Player_000_choice_002_f0I should have known Scar would be up to no good.
H

Buzz_003_f:Well, he must have started it. But I can't remember why...

Player_001_f*Let's go see Scar. I'm sure you two can...

Player_001_choice_000_f...be friends.
'
Player_001_choice_001_f...be civil.
A
Player_001_choice_002_f&...at least learn to avoid each other.
o

Buzz_009_faWell, when I first met Woody, I didn't think we'd ever get along. So I guess anything's possible.
#

Buzz_010_fOh, I'm always civil.

Buzz_012_f*It must be Scar who initiated hostilities.
‘

Buzz_011_f‚Don't worry, {PlayerName}. It's easy to avoid someone when you're my size. You just dive in the grass and no one suspects a thing.
!

Buzz_006_fThat's the thing...
!

Buzz_008_fI don't remember...

-
Player_002_choice_001_f...we can ask him.
/
Player_002_choice_002_f...we can bribe him.
W

Buzz_013_fISomething tells me he's not great at sharing, but you do know him better.
.

Buzz_014_f Let's hope he decides to answer.
B

Buzz_015_f4He does seem like he'd be susceptible to corruption.
^

Buzz_007_fPWell, he is a villain, after all. He must have been planning a nefarious scheme.

*
Player_003_choice_002_f...scold him...
a

Buzz_016_fSI'm impressed, {PlayerName}. That's just what my best friend Woody would have said.
[

Buzz_017_fMGood idea. If we know the reason why, maybe we can avoid another encounter...
g

Buzz_018_fYAre you sure scolding a villain is the way to go? But it's your Village, and I trust you.
