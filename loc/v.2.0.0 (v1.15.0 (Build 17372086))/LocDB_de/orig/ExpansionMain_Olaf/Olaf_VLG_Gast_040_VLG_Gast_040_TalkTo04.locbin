Olaf_004_f+Olaf, are you ready for your sidekick test?
A

Olaf_005_f3Definitely! But I have an important question first.


Olaf_006_fSure, what's up?
c

Olaf_007_fUIf I offer Gaston a warm hug, would that be considered trying to influence the judge?
)
Player_000_choice_000_fHmm, could be!
,
Player_000_choice_001_fNah, you're fine.
A

Olaf_008_f3I'm not sure how receptive Gaston would be, though.
,
Player_001_choice_000_fGreat idea, Olaf!
Q
Player_001_choice_001_f6I... don't think that Gaston will see things that way.
Z

Olaf_009_fLOh, so I need to become his friend first and then offer a hug? I understand.
4

Olaf_010_f&I... Sure, let's go with that for now.
`

Olaf_011_fRGaston wants to see how you're able to conquer nature. That's a big thing for him.
`

Olaf_012_fRConquer nature? How silly. Nature can't be conquered! He must mean something else.
Å

Olaf_013_fÚWell... he spent a lot of time alone in the Glittering Dunes. Maybe he wants to see how you tackle the <ActivityItem>Swirling Sands</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Glass Stalagmites</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Copper Rocks</ActivityItem>.
m

Olaf_000_f_I can deal with those with my Royal Tools, but you'll need to tag along and be a good sidekick!
U

Olaf_014_fGOkay, okay... but what if what he REALLY wants is a bouquet of flowers?
`

Olaf_015_fRIf I was trying to make a new friend and they brought me flowers, I'd be so happy!


Olaf_016_fHooray!
R

Olaf_003_fD*gasp* What if we bring him flowers that nobody's ever seen before?!
ì

Olaf_021_fÑWe could find one of those portal things to someplace else, and then bring back flowers for Gaston that are brand-new to the Valley!
<
Player_003_choice_000_f!Gaston doesn't deserve you, Olaf.

Player_003_choice_001_fWhoooaaa... slow down there.
-

Olaf_022_fOh, everyone deserves a friend.
q

Olaf_024_fcWhy don't we try for something a little simpler and gather flowers from <Lore>Eternity Isle</Lore>?
'

Olaf_025_fGreat idea, {PlayerName}!
&

Olaf_019_fLet's go conquer nature!
!

Olaf_020_fAnd gather flowers!
&

Olaf_001_fAre you ready to go now?
'
Player_002_choice_000_fLet's do it!
<
Player_002_choice_001_f!Actually, give me a moment first.


Olaf_002_fCome back soon!


Olaf_023_fOkay...
<

Olaf_017_f.Oh, I'm sure he will once he sees the flowers!
(

Olaf_018_fWell... it's your contest.
