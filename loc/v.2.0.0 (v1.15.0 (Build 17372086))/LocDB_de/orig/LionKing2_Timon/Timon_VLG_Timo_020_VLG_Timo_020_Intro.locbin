a
Timon_001_fRI've been checking out the animals in the Valley. Ya know, the squirrels and such.
%
Timon_018_fWe call them critters.
Ç
Timon_019_fs"Critters." I like that. Anyway, I wanna keep track of 'em somehow. It's always good to know your neighbors, right?
$
Timon_002_fDo ya have any ideas?
ü
Timon_005_fèWhat if you make sort of a documentary? You can take pictures, record yourself talking about them, and we can make a slideshow for the Village!
F
Timon_006_f7Uh-huh, uh-huh, that sounds good... only one problem...
5
Timon_007_f&I have NO idea what any of that means!
5
Player_001_choice_000_fOh, sorry! Let me explain!
5
Player_001_choice_001_fWhat don't you understand?
:
Player_001_choice_002_fIt's pretty self-explanatory...

Timon_012_f
Please do.
û
Timon_008_féA documentary is used to teach folks about... pretty much anything! Usually they are videos, but we can make a slideshow presentation instead.

Timon_003_fAnd you humans like these?
G
Timon_015_f8Yes! They're very interesting, and it's nice to teach‚Äî
&
Timon_016_fSo I'm gonna be FAMOUS!
i
Timon_017_fZAll right, let's do it! I can't wait for my adoring audience to praise my incredible work!
`
Timon_011_fQOkay! I bet someone around here would have a recording device that we can borrow.
ê
Timon_013_fÄBuzz might have something. He's always using his communicator. And Mr. McDuck may have also come across something in his shop...
ë
Timon_014_fÅWhile I go <Lore>talk to Buzz and Scrooge</Lore>, you should scope out the critters and decide which ones you'd want to document!

Timon_009_f&What's a documentary? Or a slideshow?!
N
Timon_010_f?CLEARLY it isn't, since I have no clue what your talking about!
G
Timon_004_f8That's fine. Come find me when you have some extra time!
