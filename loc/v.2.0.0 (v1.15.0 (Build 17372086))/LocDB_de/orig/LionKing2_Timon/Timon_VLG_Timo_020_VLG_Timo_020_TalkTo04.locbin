Timon_000_fQI found these pages in the homes of the Villains... they're written very oddly...
!
Timon_003_fAnd that means...?
)
Timon_004_fAll of them are... poetic.
.
Player_000_choice_000_fIt could be a code!
8
Player_000_choice_001_fIt looks like an incantation!
B
Player_000_choice_002_f'Maybe we've been wrong this whole time?
?
Timon_005_f0Like they're leaving each other secret messages!
-
Timon_008_f{PlayerName}, you're a genius!
G
Timon_010_f8Scar's cunning enough to create a secret code like that.
Ï
Timon_012_f¿"The Valley's predators seem poised to strike. But at who? And how?"... Narration aside, I bet this is all an elaborate ruse to get the Forgotten on their side. Scar will do anything to rule!

Timon_013_f#You think he wants to overthrow us?
=
Timon_014_f.He did it before. Trust me; he'll do it again.

Timon_015_fHAnd hey, while you were investigating, I did a little digging of my own.

Player_001_choice_000_fWhat did you find out?
A
Player_001_choice_001_f&You didn't cause any trouble, did you?
R
Player_001_choice_002_f7Well, that makes sense, since you're a meerkat and all.

Timon_016_fJust some rumors...
p
Timon_002_faApparently, Scar and Mother Gothel have been hanging around the Vitalys Mines looking suspicious.
¼
Timon_001_f¬The only way to know what's going on is to catch 'em in the act! <Lore>Take a picture of them in the Vitalys Mines and show it to the Forgotten</Lore> before it's too late!
I
Timon_017_f:Me? Cause trouble? I'm the one tryin' to STOP the trouble!
N
Timon_019_f?But I did hear a rumor about a couple of known troublemakers...

Timon_018_f*Get it? 'Cause you "did a little digging"?

Timon_020_f!...{PlayerName}, THIS IS SERIOUS!
I
Timon_006_f:Maybe they're putting together a magic spell of some kind!
s
Timon_009_fdHmm... that doesn't sound like Scar, but it could be why he teamed up with Ursula and Mother Gothel.
H
Timon_007_f9I don't see what these diary pages could possibly mean...
U
Timon_011_fFNo way; there's definitely something fishy going on... I can smell it.
