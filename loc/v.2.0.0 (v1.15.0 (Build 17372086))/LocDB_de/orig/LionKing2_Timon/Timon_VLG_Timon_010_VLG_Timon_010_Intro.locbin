Player_000_choice_001_fSorry, I'm busy right now!

Timon_002_fuGlad you asked! I wanna give Pride Rock what you might call a jungle makeover. Things feel so... exposed around here.
„
Timon_003_fuI have some great stuff to work with here. Some strong fences, lush greenery we can lounge under... or hide behind...

Timon_001_fGAre you doing okay, Timon? Seems like you might be scared of something.
‚
Timon_008_fsMe scared? No! Of course not! No way! I uh... I just need a little more jungle around me to feel at home. I'm FINE.
q
Timon_005_fbOkay, if you're sure... You may not live in the jungle anymore, but I can bring the jungle to you.
