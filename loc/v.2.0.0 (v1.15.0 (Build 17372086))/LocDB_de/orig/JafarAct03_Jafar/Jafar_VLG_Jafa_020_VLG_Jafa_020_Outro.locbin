Jafar_003_f©Okay Jafar, we've got the <ActivityItem>Stone of Creativity</ActivityItem>, and we've got the additional essences. Are you satisfied with your alchemical experiment now?
K
Jafar_004_f<Just a moment, {PlayerName}. Allow me to combine them all...
6
Jafar_006_f'This... this is not the stone I wanted!
G
Jafar_007_f8What? You didn't get the Gilded Stone? What did that do?
/
Jafar_008_f It... This is most disagreeable.
Y
Jafar_009_fJThe stone is clearly activated. I feel it summoning... emotions within me.
&
Player_000_choice_000_fThe horror!
*
Player_000_choice_001_fWhich emotions?
f
Jafar_010_fWI see â€” your response to having been taught a Secret Science is to engage in mockery.
@
Jafar_000_f1Hmm, now that I consider the matter more fully...
m
Jafar_020_f^I have learned much from this failure. And there is much that I may now attempt in the future.
H
Jafar_001_f9Yes, I believe I may find a use for this stone after all!
=
Jafar_021_f.Well, that's good to hear! What kind of stuff?
“
Jafar_022_fƒOh, I will be sure to contact you anew should I require more assistance. But rest assured, it will be for the good of the Valley...
(
Player_001_choice_000_fGood to hear!
"
Player_001_choice_001_fOkay...
^
Jafar_011_fOI'm sorry, Jafar; I guess I don't feel like emotions are particularly horrible.
1
Jafar_012_f"I feel... joy. Joy and compassion.
+
Jafar_013_fOh, that's not too bad then!
V
Jafar_014_fGThese are entirely inappropriate emotions for my current state of mind.
[
Jafar_015_fLCompassion is a distraction. And joy... About what do I have to feel joyful?
U
Jafar_016_fFNo, I can feel the stone working its way into my mind like a parasite.
R
Jafar_017_fCPerhaps you would be more suited to such an artifact, {PlayerName}.
S
Jafar_019_fDI don't know â€” maybe it would be good for you to keep this on you!
-
Jafar_023_fUntil next time, {PlayerName}.
'
Jafar_024_fThat's somewhat ominous.
¬
Jafar_025_fœMy apologies, {PlayerName}; I may have grown unused to speaking with others during my imprisonment. Rest assured: I have everyone's best interests at heart.
q
Jafar_002_fbIn truth, I find failure helpful as then I must reflect on what is necessary to achieve greatness.
t
Jafar_005_feI shall keep the stone as a reminder that science is often a process of learning from one's mistakes.

Jafar_026_fIf you say so...
