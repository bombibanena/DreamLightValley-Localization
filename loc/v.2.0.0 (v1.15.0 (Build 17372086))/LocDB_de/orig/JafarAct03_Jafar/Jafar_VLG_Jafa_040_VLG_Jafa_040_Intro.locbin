Jafar_000_f?{PlayerName}... I wonder what you have heard around the Isle...
1
Player_000_choice_000_fYeah, we need to talk.
>
Player_000_choice_001_f#I'll be back later to discuss this.

Jafar_001_fHow ominous.
i
Jafar_002_fZThe other Villagers seem unhappy with you again. Want to tell me why before I go ask them?
b
Jafar_003_fSNo need; I will tell you everything myself. The question is... will you believe me?
W
Player_001_choice_000_f<You're the only person who has lied to me in this situation.
C
Player_001_choice_001_f(If it confirms what I already suspect...
3
Player_001_choice_002_fThat's to be determined.
_
Jafar_004_fPOh dear. Were my actions really so terrible? Is my social currency so deficient?
p
Jafar_012_faThis is serious. We trusted you to be better and from the sounds of it... you haven't even tried.
{
Jafar_014_flI will, of course, find you a defense attorney while I go around and get the truth from the other Villagers.
^
Jafar_015_fOReally? You think any of those simpletons could form a coherent legal argument?
3
Jafar_016_f$I will, of course, represent myself.
ž
Jafar_018_fŽFine, fine, I'll leave you to work on your case for now. I'll be in touch when we're ready to kick things off. Be careful, Jafar. I'm serious.
Ï
Jafar_005_f¿Well, you DID try to steal Oswald's abilities and hypnotized some of the other Villagers so, yes â€” I'm more inclined to believe them. But I still want to hear your version of recent events.
}
Jafar_006_fnWell, first there was Rapunzel. I was merely trying to offer helpful artistic advice. She so clearly needs it.

Jafar_007_fJafar...
L
Jafar_008_f=And the capybaras should be glad that they're finally useful.
ˆ
Jafar_009_fyAs for Gaston, I am surprised he even has the capacity for speech. Obviously, you should disregard whatever he tells you.
{
Jafar_017_flFinally, Scrooge McDuck and EVE cannot be trusted to speak truthfully â€” they both have agendas against me.
É
Jafar_010_f¹Sounds like you've been up to SOMETHING... And I warned you about being on probation. I didn't want it to come to this, but... we're gonna need to enact the first-ever Dreamlight Court.
(
Jafar_011_fA trial? Surely you jest.
