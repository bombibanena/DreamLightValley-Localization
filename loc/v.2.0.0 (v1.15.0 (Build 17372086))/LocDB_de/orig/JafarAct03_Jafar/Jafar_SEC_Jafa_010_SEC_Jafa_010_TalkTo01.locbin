Jafar_001_f0All right Jafar, how are you feeling after that?

Jafar_002_f&Feeding the cobra was almost pleasant.
Œ
Jafar_003_f}But there was a disappointing aura of Dreamlight "cuteness" around the reptile that I found insulting to its natural dignity.

Player_000_choice_000_fHey, snakes can be cute!
D
Player_000_choice_001_f)Well, happy that you enjoyed it somewhat.
J
Jafar_004_f;Just because one can do something does not mean one should.

Jafar_014_fAnd overall? How do you feel?
i
Jafar_015_fZI suppose a bit nostalgic... I find myself recalling fondly the afternoon I acquired Iago.
k
Jafar_016_f\Such glorious days, {PlayerName}. I had dozens of nascent plots, just waiting to be enacted.

Jafar_017_f«The Sultan, doing my bidding. Iago, on my shoulder offering the cutting commentary my lessers so deserved. Those were marvelous times, before things became... complicated.

i
Jafar_010_fZFair enough; we all have different associations with different animals. And the capybaras?
@
Jafar_012_f1Strange creatures. Their placidity is... uncanny.
Z
Jafar_013_fKThey seem to remain consistently unbothered by whatever occurs around them.
j
Jafar_018_f[I would hesitate to describe it as "friendship," but yes, that was a pleasant reminiscence.
l
Jafar_021_f]Now, have my actions been sufficient to satisfy the service to the community that you demand?
}
Jafar_022_fnPretty much! There's just one last thing, but I need to talk to the other Villagers. I'll be back soon enough.

