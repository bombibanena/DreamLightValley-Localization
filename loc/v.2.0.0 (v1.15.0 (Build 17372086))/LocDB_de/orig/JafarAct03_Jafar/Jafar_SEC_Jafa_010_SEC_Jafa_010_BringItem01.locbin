Jafar_005_f5{PlayerName}... I must confess â€” this is excellent.
q
Jafar_006_fbHad my plans of domination been successful, I should think I would have kept you on as royal chef.

Jafar_007_fPWere he to bring me food like this, I would have been able to form a comparison.
5
Jafar_011_f&Does the food spark any good memories?
ƒ
Jafar_012_ftHmm, well it does bring to mind the markets of Agrabah â€” always full of marvelous foods brought from near and far.
.
Jafar_014_fAnd how did that make you feel?
†
Jafar_015_fwInspired! It was my first glimpse at how wide the world was, how much was out there for me to learn, to use, to master.

A
Jafar_029_f2Now let's hang out and feed some adorable animals!
\
Jafar_030_fMYour enthusiasm for these empty-headed creatures is rather cloying, you know.

Jafar_020_f"All right, why don't we move on...

Jafar_021_f.How do you feel about the animals around here?
/
Jafar_022_f They are a distraction, at best.
x
Jafar_023_fiOkay, let's work on that. Next step in your community service is going to be feeding the animals with me.
G
Jafar_024_f8If that is what is required for me to stay... very well.
O
Jafar_025_f@All right, well each animal has their own favorite type of food.
–
Jafar_026_f†Of that I am quite aware. It required only trivial experimentation to discover which foods would occupy them enough to leave me alone.

J

f
Jafar_010_fWYes, that's kinda the point of this exercise. Any good memories that the food stirs up?
