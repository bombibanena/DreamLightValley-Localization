Aladdin_001_fêI'm thinking <ActivityItem>Fine Rope</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Timber Stacks</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Bolts of Silk</ActivityItem>.
º
Aladdin_002_f™Okay! I'll find all of that and make us some <ActivityItem>Stall Repair Kits</ActivityItem>. We'll have everything we need to fix up the stalls in one convenient package.
