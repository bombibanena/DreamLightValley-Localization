T
Ursula_003_fDUgh! You're bothering me about that annoying little creature? Again?
‚
Ursula_004_frAngelfish, wouldn't it be better if I turned him into something that can't move... or talk? A sea anemone perhaps?
,
Player_002_choice_000_fPlease calm down.

Player_002_choice_001_fWhy are you so angry?
,
Player_002_choice_002_fI'm on your side.

Ursula_012_f,Calm down? I'm the victim in this situation!
y
Ursula_015_fiTell me, dearie, what would you do if someone was constantly harassing you simply because of who you are?
;
Player_003_choice_000_f I'd prove to them I can be nice.

Player_003_choice_001_fI'd try to understand them.
9
Player_003_choice_002_fI'd pretend I changed my ways.
ª
Ursula_005_f™Those who see themselves in authority rarely change their minds. Just look at Triton. Oh, but I've been playing this game long enough to know what to do.
G
Ursula_008_f7I'll PRETEND I respect the irritating little plaything.
m
Ursula_006_f]Understandâ€”?! The only thing that piece of junk understands is when people flatter his ego.
o
Ursula_009_f_But I am impressed he's gone to such lengths to try and intimidate me. It's almost... charming.
s
Ursula_010_fcWell, if it'll get him to stop annoying me, I'll pretend I respect the irritating little plaything.
“
Ursula_007_f‚Hmm... You have a point, child. Maybe what that irritating little plaything is waiting for is for me to acknowledge his authority.
>
Ursula_011_f.Some are so easily manipulated by appearances.
n
Ursula_017_f^Fine. I'll pretend to be afraid of him if it buys me some peace. I'll avoid the little ranger.
€
Ursula_013_fpAsk yourself, dear... how would you react if someone was constantly harassing you simply because of who you are?
x
Ursula_014_fhBut you still let that creature pester me incessantly. Tell me, dearie, how would you react in my place?
