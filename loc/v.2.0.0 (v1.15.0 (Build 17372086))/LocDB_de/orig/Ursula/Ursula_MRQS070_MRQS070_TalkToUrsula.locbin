u
Ursula_027_feWhy, that's just what I need! You see, I'm stuck in this rotten cave. Won't you help a poor girl out?
T
Ursula_003_fDYou must possess great magic if you got through the cave entrance...

å
Ursula_012_f|You see, before the Forgetting happened, the <Lore>Pillar of Power</Lore> protected Dazzle Beach from curses and evil magic.
≥
Ursula_019_f¢But soon after the Forgetting began, a starfish told me someone had stolen the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> from the Pillar and hid it in a cave on the Beach.
u
Ursula_026_feOf course, I was just dying to help the Village, so I started to search this cave to try and find it.

Ursula_005_f)And what was the reward for my good deed?
1
Ursula_013_f!Imprisonment in this horrid cave!

Ursula_047_fmIf you get me out, I'll tell you everything you need to know about the Forgetting. Do we have a deal, dearie?

2
Player_009_choice_001_fNo way! You're a witch.
õ
Ursula_036_fäI needed something called a <ActivityItem>Crystal Key</ActivityItem> to enter the cave where the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> is held.
ç
Ursula_008_f}I have it here, and I'll even part with it for free. As long as you promise not to forget me while you're off running around.
h
Ursula_045_fXUse it correctly, and it will ignite the ancient magic hidden beneath Dreamlight Valley.

Ursula_009_fmWell, what are you waiting for? Hurry! We can't risk another curse hitting us and trapping you in here too...

¨
Ursula_042_fõHa! You'll soon learn that sometimes you have to trust even a witch to get what you want. And since you want me out of here, our interests are... entwined.
6
Ursula_015_f&Think you're rather clever, don't you?
ä
Ursula_021_fzWell, perhaps I had my own reasons for seeking the <ActivityItem>Orb of Power</ActivityItem>... I'll never tell. Anyway...
