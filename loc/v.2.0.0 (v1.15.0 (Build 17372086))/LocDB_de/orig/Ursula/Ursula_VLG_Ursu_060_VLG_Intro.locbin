Ursula_023_f+Well, I'm looking for a very powerful item.
¢
Ursula_007_fëWhen my little experiment to extract the power from the Valley failed, I learned about a dark and potent power that lurks in the Forgotten Lands.

Player_000_choice_007_fI'm not sure I should...

Ursula_001_fzLittle princie-poo BEGGED me to save his beloved Ariel's <ActivityItem>Memory</ActivityItem> when the Forgetting happened.
Ä
Ursula_050_fpAnd so I did, of course... for a price! I sent Ariel away from the Valley so the Forgetting wouldn't affect her.
É
Ursula_002_fsAnd now he's a guest in my little garden! Such a poor unfortunate soul. Ariel will never know what happened to him!

Ursula_009_fnYou are EXHAUSTING! But who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth? Go to the Forgotten Lands and look around.
