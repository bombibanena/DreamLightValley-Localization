Mulan_001_fMSay, Mulan... you're a fierce warrior who's good with a bo staff, aren't you?
$
Mulan_002_fI'd like to think so.
E
Mulan_003_f6Before the Forgetting... were you friends with Merida?

Mulan_004_f	Merida...
\
Mulan_005_fMOf course! Merida! I remember now... We always had a wonderful time together.
B
Player_000_choice_000_f'That makes sense. You two are so alike.
Q
Player_000_choice_002_f6I'm surprised you weren't competitive with each other!
f
Mulan_006_fWMerida told me a story once, about shooting for her own hand and deciding her own fate.
6
Mulan_007_f'I knew then that we'd be great friends.
l
Mulan_009_f]You and Merida should catch up later. But right now, I'm on the trail of something important.
ç
Mulan_010_f~Hades is after some sort of artifact. It sounds like Merida asked you to help her hide it. Do you remember anything like that?
G
Mulan_011_f8Oh... now that you mention it, that DOES sound familiar.
≠
Mulan_012_fùMerida asked me to hide a clue somewhere even she wouldn't find it. I remember I climbed up a <Lore>statue of a giant flying horse</Lore>. I hope that helps.
°
Mulan_008_fëOh, we were a little at first. Luckily, though, Merida knew that I was the most skilled with a bo staff, and she was the most skilled at archery.
