Olaf_001_f&Nervous? No! I can't wait to be older!
<

Olaf_002_f.When you're ancient, so much more makes sense.

Olaf_003_fPI'm hoping that someday everyone will think of me as... (ahem)... Olaf the Wise!

Player_001_choice_002_fBit cheesy, isn't it?

Olaf_011_fI'm glad you like it.
P

Olaf_012_fBYou warmed my heart, but... it's not really the Forgotten's style.
l

Olaf_013_f^I guess I'll just have to keep looking for <Lore>someone worried about growing older</Lore>...

Olaf_014_f#I prefer to think of it as sincere!

Olaf_015_fTIt definitely is... coming from you. But it's just not really the Forgotten's style.

Olaf_016_fgBye, {PlayerName}! If the Forgotten needs any help with fun facts... I could definitely help with that!
