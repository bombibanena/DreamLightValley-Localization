Ariel_001_f\Hmm. Stamps get sticky when they're wet, right? I'll have to make sure I keep them very dry.

Ariel_002_fcOoh, that would be fun! I've already seen so many different kinds of hats; there must be even more.

Ariel_005_fLAnd I could learn their names! I really want to know what a "fascinator" is.
