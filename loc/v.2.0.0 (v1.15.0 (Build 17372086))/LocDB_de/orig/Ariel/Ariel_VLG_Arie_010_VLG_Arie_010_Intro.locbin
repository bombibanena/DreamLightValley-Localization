Ariel_000_fzSomeone's here! Oh, I've been stuck here alone for so long, I thought I'd never see anyone again. Can you help me, please?
,
Ariel_017_fI'll help you! What happened?
Y
Ariel_002_fJI was living in a beautiful Valley. And it was the most wonderful place...
A
Ariel_001_f2...until something called the Forgetting happened.
p
Ariel_004_faNight Thorns started growing in the Village and lots of people lost their memories. It was awful!
J
Ariel_016_f;But then, all of a sudden... I was here. As if... by magic.
y
Ariel_005_fjI haven't seen anyone in such a long time. I tried to go back to the Valley, but I can't find my way home.
B
Player_000_choice_012_f'I come from that Valley. I'll help you.
@
Player_000_choice_013_f%A mermaid that can't navigate? Weird.
;
Ariel_006_f,Oh, thank you! I've been trying to get home.
W
Ariel_007_fHBut no matter which way I swim, I just end up right back on this island.
9
Player_000_choice_015_fIt must be some kind of magic.
6
Player_000_choice_016_fThat sounds so frustrating.
2
Player_000_choice_018_fHop on my raft instead.
+
Ariel_010_fI think it's an enchantment.
Q
Ariel_009_fBIf I could just sense the Valley, then I'd know which way to swim.
u
Ariel_013_ffMerpeople can always find their way home, but it doesn't even feel like the Valley is my home anymore.
{
Ariel_014_flMaybe if I made a place just for you in the Valley, somewhere that feels like home, then you could sense it.
t
Ariel_015_feThat's perfect! Could it be in the water just off the beach? Then I know I'll be able to swim home...
U
Ariel_018_fFOh my gosh! I almost forgot to introduce myself! I'm Ariel. And you...
5
Ariel_019_f&You seem familiar. Have we met before?
Œ
Ariel_020_f}I think we have. But that was a long time ago. I'm {PlayerName}. The Ruler of Dreamlight Valley. Or at least... I used to be.
f
Ariel_021_fWYou are! Oh, you're so grown up now. I can't believe you're back and you're helping me!
T
Ariel_022_fEI'm happy to help. I'll get that home ready for you as soon as I can.
s
Ariel_003_fdHmm. No, I don't think so. But I'm happy to help. I'll get that home ready for you as soon as I can.
]
Ariel_011_fNI kept blaming myself for the longest time. But now I know it wasn't my fault.
‰
Ariel_012_fzI'm afraid that if I get on your raft, you'll get all turned around too. There's something keeping me here on this island.
`
Ariel_008_fQI can navigate perfectly well, thank you very much. Or at least... I usually can.
