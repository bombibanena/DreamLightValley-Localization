Player_000_choice_000_fYou look AMAZING in them!
E
Player_000_choice_001_f*I think Belle's really going to like them!
;
Player_000_choice_002_f How did you like the experience?
%
Beast_001_fI look like what I am.
U
Beast_002_fFWere the other Villagers staring? I feel like they were staring at me.

Player_001_choice_000_fNah, you were imagining it.
P
Player_001_choice_001_f5They were curious â€” they've barely seen you around!
_
Player_001_choice_002_fDThey wanted to see who was this stylish prince having a photo shoot!
(
Beast_003_fDo you think that's true?

Beast_004_fI do!

Beast_005_f+Thank you for trying to help, {PlayerName}.

Beast_006_fLIt's... harder to talk to people without Lumiere and Cogsworth to advise me.
!
Beast_007_fJust look at me...
;
Player_002_choice_000_f I see a person with a big heart.
<
Player_002_choice_001_f!I see someone who needs to relax!
[
Player_002_choice_002_f@I see a charming prince who just needs to come out of his shell.
.
Beast_008_fIs that a reference to my size?

Beast_009_fNo!
€
Beast_010_fqHow about this: Since you don't have your usual advisors, I can get some advice from the other Villagers for you!
N
Beast_011_f?I don't know... How could others help me understand Belle orâ€”
Y
Beast_012_fJTrust me, Beast. They'll be more than happy to help out a fellow Villager!
'
Beast_013_fI suppose it's possible.
˜
Beast_014_fˆWhy don't we try Mickey? He and Minnie have a really solid relationship but also support each other pursuing their individual interests.
`
Beast_015_fQMinnie was in a whole other dimension for a while, but they're still doing great!
D
Beast_016_f5Mickey is rather small. Won't he be frightened of me?
O
Beast_017_f@No way! Mickey is really nice. He'd be tickled pink to help you.

Beast_018_foAnd what about Mirabel? She comes from a pretty big family... I bet she can tell you about what works for them.
E
Beast_019_f6I don't understand how this will help, but I will try.
R
Beast_020_fCWhy don't we try Mickey? His relationship with Minnie is legendary!

Beast_021_fYou sound like Lumiere.

Beast_022_fI... Thank you, {PlayerName}.
;
Beast_023_f,They were whispering about me, weren't they?
.
Beast_024_fThat was 100% your imagination.
X
Beast_025_fIStylish?! I can't fit into regular human clothes, how could I be stylish?
T
Beast_026_fEThat cloak is quite the statement piece. And it brings out your eyes!

Beast_027_fYou do?

Beast_028_fI do!

Beast_029_f9Well, I suppose it was nice to see more of the Village...
