Player_000_choice_002_fThere is Donald Duck.

Mickey_001_fUGosh, I think everybody knows somebody with a short fuse. Like my friend Donald Duck.
u
Mickey_005_feWhen he thinks something's not fair or somebody's being treated badly, he can get real mad real fast.

Mickey_007_f!What do you do when that happens?
/
Player_000_choice_003_fEmpathize with them.
+
Player_000_choice_004_fGive them space.
(
Player_000_choice_005_fI'm not sure.
S
Mickey_008_fCYou mean you let your friend know you understand why they're angry?
B
Mickey_004_f2Wow, that's real nice. I bet they appreciate that.
N
Mickey_009_f>That's probably smart. I know Donald never stays mad for long.
:
Mickey_006_f*You sure are a great friend, {PlayerName}.
Ä
Mickey_010_f³Yeah, sometimes it's hard to know. With Donald, I've found that the best thing to do is just give him some space. Of course, if I can fix whatever he's mad about, that helps, too.
‹
Mickey_002_f{Then I guess you haven't met Donald Duck yet! Ha-ha! But don't worry. He's a great guy. I couldn't ask for a better friend.
