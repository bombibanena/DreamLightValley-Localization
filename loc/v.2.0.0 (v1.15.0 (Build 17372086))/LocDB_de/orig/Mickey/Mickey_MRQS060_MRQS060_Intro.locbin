Player_000_choice_001_fIt's not so bad...
2
Player_000_choice_002_fIt needs a little love.

Mickey_001_fIt sure is.
_
Mickey_009_fOMinnie definitely wouldn't be happy if she saw it like this. She loves gardens.
€
Mickey_011_fpWell, the sooner we make this recipe, the sooner we can make Dreamlight Valley a place she'll be proud of again!
Ï
Mickey_004_f¾Okay... the recipe says to prepare the <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>. We need Fruit, like <ActivityItem>Apples</ActivityItem>. I bet you can find some of those around the Village.
e
Mickey_005_fUOh, and you know what would be great with a <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>?
;
Mickey_012_f+Some <ActivityItem>Crackers</ActivityItem>!

"
Mickey_016_fOh gosh... Thanks!
Ÿ
Mickey_019_fŽBut, uh... to tell ya the truth, the real reason I wanna make <ActivityItem>Crackers</ActivityItem> is 'cause that's what Minnie used to make.
@
Mickey_020_f0Guess I just wish she were here to make 'em now.
2
Player_000_choice_003_fMickey... are you okay?
2
Player_000_choice_004_fSo how do we make them?
X
Mickey_014_fHMe? Aw, I'm fine. I miss Minnie, but it sure helps that you're here now.
ª
Mickey_013_f™Okay, Minnie's <ActivityItem>Crackers</ActivityItem> are super easy to bake. They only take some <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>. Here's the recipe...
[
Mickey_006_fKYikes! I forgot. We'll have to start gardening before we can start cooking!
W
Mickey_015_fGTo get some <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>, we'll have to plant it.
/
Mickey_008_fHere are some seeds we can use.
\
Mickey_003_fLIt'll be great to replace all those ugly Night Thorns with some nice plants!
M
Mickey_017_f=Gosh, just because it's not fancy doesn't mean it's not good.
;
Mickey_018_f+Yep, and there's nothing wrong with simple.
B
Mickey_007_f2Aw, thanks for being nice, but I know it's a mess.
T
Mickey_010_fDYeah, it just hasn't been the same since the Night Thorns showed up.
