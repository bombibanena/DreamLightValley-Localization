Buzz_000_f0Hey, Buzz... has Scar been bothering you lately?
`

Buzz_001_fRHmm... Although Scar and I settled things amicably in regards to our friendship...
J

Buzz_003_f<...sometimes he pushes the boundaries of friendship too far.
+
Player_000_choice_000_fThat sounds bad.

Player_000_choice_001_fWhat does that even MEAN?
&

Buzz_005_fWell, it isn't pleasant.
k

Buzz_006_f]Lately, Scar seems to enjoy knocking me into mud puddles. One bat of his paw and I go flying.
P

Buzz_007_fBIt takes me hours to get the mud out of the buttons on my uniform.


Buzz_008_fSometimes days!

Player_001_choice_000_fDoes he at least apologize?
1
Player_001_choice_001_fMaybe it's accidental?
-
Player_001_choice_002_fMushu was right...

Buzz_010_f&Negative. He laughs and saunters away.
Y

Buzz_013_fKI'm sorry this happened, Buzz. Mushu and I are going to work on a solution.
^

Buzz_009_fPAn optimistic but unlikely explanation. He always laughs right after it happens.


Buzz_011_fMushu?
n

Buzz_012_f`He said he's got a feeling Scar is picking on smaller Villagers... I have to report back to him.
<

Buzz_004_f.It means... And this is tough for me to say...
r

Buzz_002_fd... Scar is a villain. His interactions with me recently have done nothing to convince me otherwise!
