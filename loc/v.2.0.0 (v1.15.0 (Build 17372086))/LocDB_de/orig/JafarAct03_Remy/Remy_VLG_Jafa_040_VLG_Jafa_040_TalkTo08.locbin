Remy_001_fHow you holding up, Remy?
W

Remy_002_fII'm doin' just fine, {PlayerName}. I should be asking you the same thing!
d

Remy_003_fVEveryone at Chez Remy's been talking about Jafar. I don't envy you your job right now.
‚

Remy_004_ftYeah, it's rough. We've never had to exile anyone from the community, but what if it comes to that during the trial?
{

Remy_005_fmI'd like to be pleasantly surprised by Jafar, but his prior actions haven't really done much to inspire hope.

Remy_006_f-Hmm, what if we bring food into the equation?

Player_000_choice_000_fGo on...

Player_000_choice_001_f1Of course you'd suggest something involving food.

Remy_007_fLWell, I can't help but think back to when I first had to cook for Anton Ego.

Remy_010_fwI was so scared of him, the power he wielded, the mean-spirited part of him that always seemed to float on the surface.

Remy_011_fMBut he really changed, and all he needed was to be reminded of a better time.
?

Remy_012_f1Hmm, do you think Jafar could have the same path?
o

Remy_013_faYour guess is as good as mine, but it's worth a shot! What do we know about Jafar's past, anyway?
H

Remy_014_f:Hmm, basically nothing. That's a good point; thanks, Remy.
g

Remy_015_fYI think I'll use this idea as part of a sentence if we need something lighter than exile.

Remy_008_fHey, stick with what you know!
a

Remy_009_fSBut, I can't help thinking back to when I first had to cook for Anton Ego in Paris.
