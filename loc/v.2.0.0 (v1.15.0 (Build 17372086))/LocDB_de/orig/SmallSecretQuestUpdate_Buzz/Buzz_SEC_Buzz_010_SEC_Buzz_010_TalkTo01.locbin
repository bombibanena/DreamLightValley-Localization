Buzz_000_f:Ah, {PlayerName}! Just the Space Ranger I was looking for.
?

Buzz_001_f1I have another mission for you. It's a Code G-7B.
K
Player_000_choice_000_f0An action figure is missing its removable parts?
R
Player_000_choice_001_f7A doll lost some accessories that were sold separately?
K
Player_000_choice_002_f0A stuffed animal fell into the dog's water dish?
0
Player_000_choice_003_fA toy's gone missing?
E

Buzz_002_f7Close, Space Ranger. Missing components is a Code G-6B.
/

Buzz_006_f!Code G-7B is a search and rescue.
†

Buzz_007_fëRemember those <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> that wandered away from Woody's Carousel? At the time, I suspected a few were unaccounted for.
_

Buzz_008_fQAnd I was right. I now have intel that many of them are somewhere in the Village.
;
Player_001_choice_000_f We have to find and rescue them!
A
Player_001_choice_001_f&What if they don't want to be rescued?
R

Buzz_009_fDPrecisely. Those toys could be out there frightened and disoriented.
F

Buzz_010_f8And have you seen the size of the squirrels around here?
b

Buzz_012_fTThey could turn those <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> into chew toys in no time.
1

Buzz_013_f#Okay, where should I start looking?
G

Buzz_014_f9We'll need to do a survey of every sector in the Village.
_

Buzz_015_fQThere's no telling where the <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> might have gone.
q

Buzz_020_fcToys are highly skilled at hiding in the backs of closets, behind beds, and between couch cushions.
:

Buzz_022_f,Got it. I'll look everywhere in the Village.
&

Buzz_023_fOh, and one final thing.
x

Buzz_024_fjThese <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> can be a bit shy. They might not all come out of hiding at once.
Å

Buzz_025_fsKeep an eye out for them while you complete your regular duties. I suspect they could pop up in multiple locations.
Q

Buzz_016_fCHmm... But there's one sector that's still closed off, isn't there?
O

Buzz_017_fAThat's right! I think that place is called the Forgotten Lands...
k

Buzz_018_f]I can't imagine why any toy would want to go there. Being forgotten is a sad thing for a toy.
`

Buzz_019_fRBut you'll need to check there too if you want to be sure you've located them all.
N

Buzz_011_f@Unlikely. They're probably out there frightened and disoriented.
F

Buzz_003_f8Not bad, Space Ranger. Missing equipment is a Code G-7A.
V

Buzz_004_fHNot even close, Space Ranger. An aquatic canine incident is a Code G-7C.
J

Buzz_005_f<Exactly! Someone's been reading their Star Command handbook!
