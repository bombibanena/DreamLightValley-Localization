Nala_003_fkMore <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem>? Did you find these in the Frosted Heights and the Glade?
l

Nala_004_f^That's right. They were all buried in the ground, just like the first one. But that's not all.
U

Nala_005_fGMore of these weird rifts have opened up in other parts of the Village.

Nala_006_f+Oh no. Do you think whatever's happening...
J

Nala_007_f<...is my fault? I was the one who damaged that first statue.
L
Player_000_choice_000_f1Of course not. You didn't know this would happen.
@
Player_000_choice_001_f%It's okay. We'll solve this together.
H
Player_000_choice_002_f-Are you kidding?! If anything, it's my fault.
%

Nala_008_fI suppose you're right.


Nala_014_fqLet's start with these rifts. Did anything dangerous come out of the one on Dazzle Beach while you were watching?
M

Nala_015_f?I didn't see anything come out of it. But something did happen.
_

Nala_016_fQGoofy came by to fish. He cast out his rod near the rift and snagged something...
*

Nala_017_fThen he shouted and ran off.
a

Nala_018_fSOh boy. Sounds like I better <Lore>go talk to Goofy</Lore> to find out what he saw.
L

Nala_009_f>Thanks, {PlayerName}. I know we can get to the bottom of this.
M

Nala_010_f?You might have found the statue, but I'm the one who dug it up.
*

Nala_011_fThat's when the rift opened.
M

Nala_012_f?I'm sure it's no one's fault. We didn't know what would happen.
_

Nala_013_fQBut if we caused this problem together, then that's how we'll solve it. Together.
