Nala_000_fM{PlayerName}, would you like to hear a story from when Simba and I were cubs?
K

Nala_001_f=I could tell you about elephant tag. That's a game I made up.
n

Nala_013_f`Or about the time we almost got killed in the elephant graveyard. Or about the giraffe incident.

Player_001_choice_001_fGiraffe incident.

Player_001_choice_002_fElephant graveyard.

Nala_003_fhAll right. Elephant tag is really fun. You find a herd of elephants on the move, and then you tag Simba.
]

Nala_006_fOAs soon as you tag him, you run under the elephants' feet to get away from him!
c

Nala_014_fUIt's like regular tag, but you have to make sure you don't get squashed by elephants.
+
Player_002_choice_000_fThat sounds fun!

Player_002_choice_001_fThat sounds dangerous.

Nala_007_fIt was! And I always won.
l

Nala_008_f^It wasn't, really. The elephants knew we were there, so they did their best not to step on us.
i

Nala_015_f[Simba did get his tail stepped on one time. He was pretty sore about that, but he was fine.
ú

Nala_004_fçSo Simba got this idea that we could ride on a giraffe. We'd hide on the top of a big rock and jump on this giraffe's back when he walked by.
á

Nala_009_fyThe thing is, we didn't realize that having two lion cubs jump at him from out of nowhere would really scare the giraffe.
å

Nala_012_f~When we tried it, the giraffe bolted, ran right into a mud hole, and got stuck. Zazu had to talk a rhino into pulling him out.
(

Nala_010_fWe got in so much trouble.
^

Nala_005_fPWell, when Simba and I were cubs, we snuck off to explore an elephant graveyard.
±

Nala_016_f¢It's this creepy place, with skulls bigger than the two of us put together, and holes that shoot out steam. I think you've got a place just like it in the Valley.
p

Nala_011_fbIt turned out to be a really bad idea. We almost got eaten by hyenas. But Simba's father saved us.
