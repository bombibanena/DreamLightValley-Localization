Nala_001_feI see. Like Timon. And Remy. Though he says it's because he doesn't like to get his front paws dirty.

Nala_002_frThat makes sense. If I rear up on my back legs, I can catch or bat at things. You're just doing that all the time.

Nala_003_fsOh, I can't balance for very long on just my back legs. Plus, staying low to the ground is useful when I'm hunting.
