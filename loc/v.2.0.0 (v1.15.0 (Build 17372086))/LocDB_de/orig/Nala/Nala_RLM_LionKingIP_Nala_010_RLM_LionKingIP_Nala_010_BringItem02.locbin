Nala_006_fOIt's a <ActivityItem>Sound System</ActivityItem>. I'll get the speakers set up.
:

Nala_001_f,Just think of it as a really big noisemaker.
q

Nala_007_fcIf you and Simba roar into the microphone as loud as you can, the noise will fill the whole jungle.
h

Nala_008_fZThe hyenas will think we've got an army of lions on our side. That should scare them away.
'

Nala_009_fI guess it's worth a try.
#

Nala_010_fSay, can humans roar?
B

Nala_011_f4If you roared with us, it would make it even louder.
"
