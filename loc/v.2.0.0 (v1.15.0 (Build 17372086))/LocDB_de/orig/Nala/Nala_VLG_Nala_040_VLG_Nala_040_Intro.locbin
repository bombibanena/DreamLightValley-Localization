Nala_003_f[{PlayerName}, last night the <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem> started to glow.
M

Nala_004_f?It's time to close those rifts once and for all. Are you ready?
)
Player_000_choice_000_fLet's do this.
.
Player_000_choice_001_fI'll be back later.
ª

Nala_000_f¨Based on that Memory we uncovered in Pride Rock, we need to put these <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem> inside the <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem>.
X

Nala_001_fJBut I don't remember how... Ugh! Why doesn't any of this make sense to me?
D
Player_001_choice_000_f)I'll understand it enough for both of us.
R
Player_001_choice_001_f7We don't have to understand it. We just need to fix it.
@
Player_001_choice_002_f%At least we can be confused together.
P

Nala_015_fBYou're right. I shouldn't get upset. We can work on this together.
è

Nala_002_fÄBut if I'm going to understand it, I need someone to explain it to me first... Looks like I have to <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>.
ó

Nala_006_fàThat's right. We left those old <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> with her. Maybe she's had time to figure out how they work.
h

Nala_020_fZI'll keep watch over the rifts and try to catch fish for the others while you talk to her.
A

Nala_016_f3You're right. And now, we might finally be able to.
>

Nala_018_f0First, I'll have to <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>.
E

Nala_017_f7That's true. All this "magic" stuff still bewilders me.
n

Nala_005_f`All the more reason to find somebody else who understands it! Let's <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>.
>

Nala_009_f0Please hurry. I don't know how long we can wait.
