Nala_003_fTI remember now! A long time ago, the Here and There started to leak into the Valley.
L

Nala_008_f>We worked with Merlin to do something involving those statues.
?

Nala_009_f1But I still can't remember why they look like me.
T
Player_000_choice_000_f9You're the protector of the Village. It just makes sense.
L
Player_000_choice_001_f1I'm not sure either. I guess we could ask Merlin.
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&Well, they had to look like something.
J

Nala_010_f<Me? The protector? You really think of me like that...? Wow.
G

Nala_020_f9Maybe we could <Lore>borrow something from Minnie</Lore>.
.

Nala_021_f Great idea. I'll check with her.
d

Nala_002_fVI feel like there was something else we had to do... some kind of fourth ingredient...
&

Nala_004_fI wish I could remember.
]

Nala_005_fODon't worry, Nala. I'll gather everything we need. Maybe it'll come back to us.
[

Nala_000_fMI appreciate it... I do. But the important thing is that we fix this problem.
T

Nala_013_fFIn the Memory, I think I saw how it all worked. It was an enchantment.
s

Nala_014_feEach <ActivityItem>Lioness Statue</ActivityItem> has an <ActivityItem>Enchanted Heart</ActivityItem>.
~

Nala_015_fpWe needed something magical from here... something from there... and something that's spent time in both places.
p

Nala_017_fbFor something magical from here, I think we used <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> before.
j

Nala_016_f\And the fish are from the other side. We could <Lore>catch those fish near the rifts</Lore>.
ù

Nala_018_féIf we </Lore>catch three fish</Lore>, that should do it. But what could we get to complete the spell? Something that's been in both places...?
C

Nala_019_f5Didn't you say Minnie had been to the Here and There?
b

Nala_011_fTI don't think it really matters. What matters right now is that we fix this problem.
u

Nala_012_fgI guess you're right. If it had been Donald who'd noticed the rifts, maybe they'd all look like Donald.
X

Nala_001_fJBut I guess it doesn't matter. We just need to figure out how to fix this.
