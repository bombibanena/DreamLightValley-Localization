Nala_000_fHmm. I don't see Simba.
g

Nala_001_fYBut the good news is, I don't see anything around here that would want to eat you either.

Player_000_choice_000_fThat's a relief.
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$Maybe I can help you look for Simba.

Player_000_choice_002_f/I'm a little insulted. I'm a buffet-and-a-half.

Nala_002_fGI can imagine. And it means we can cover more ground looking for Simba.
y

Nala_006_fkI'll look around here. Why don't you <Lore>look for Simba on the other side of the river over there?</Lore>
a

Nala_011_fSI'll need to find some way to get across. Maybe if I could knock over those logs...

Nala_008_f+If you aren't a threat, he's very friendly.

Nala_009_fZIf he bares his teeth, just <Lore>say, "hakuna matata."</Lore> He'll know you're a friend.

Nala_005_faI'm going to assume you're joking. But let's not push our luck. We should keep looking for Simba.
