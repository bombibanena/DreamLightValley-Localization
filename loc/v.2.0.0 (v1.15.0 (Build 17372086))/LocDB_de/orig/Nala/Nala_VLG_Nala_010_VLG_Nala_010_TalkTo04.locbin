Nala_006_f}I looked over the Beach. You've done a wonderful job, {PlayerName}. Now there are plenty of trails and pouncing spots for us.
2

Nala_000_f$And your coverings should work well.
/
Player_003_choice_000_fPerfect as always...
G
Player_003_choice_001_f,It should be good enough for our expedition.
D
Player_003_choice_002_f)These "whiskers" make me feel ridiculous.
u

Nala_001_fgI don't know enough about how you change your appearance to say. But you look ready for our expedition.
J

Nala_007_f<We just need to lie in wait. Let me teach you how to pounce.
9
Player_000_choice_000_fI'm already an expert pouncer.
G
Player_000_choice_001_f,I could use all the pouncing tips I can get.
N
Player_000_choice_002_f3I'd rather just get my food from the grocery store.
b

Nala_008_fTReally? Well, then we'll just have to wait for an antelope or a zebra to come along.
7

Nala_010_f)Then we can see who's the better pouncer.
1

Nala_011_f#Just follow my lead and stay quiet.
P

Nala_015_fBI wonder why this isn't working. You do have prey here, don't you?
)

Nala_016_fAntelope? Zebras? Gazelles?
!

Nala_017_fMaybe a wildebeest?
F

Nala_018_f8We just don't have many animals like that in the Valley.
C
Player_001_choice_000_f(Most animals around here are my friends.
C
Player_001_choice_001_f(We've got lots of fruits and vegetables.
;
Player_001_choice_002_f I could bake you a cake instead?
q

Nala_019_fcOh... Well, I guess we make friends with prey sometimes, too. Like Simba did with Timon and Pumbaa.
I

Nala_023_f;That does leave us with a problem, though. What will I eat?
E

Nala_022_f7Oh! I know! You could eat fish! We've got lots of fish.
K

Nala_024_f=I'm not too good at fishing. I don't do very well with water.
J

Nala_025_f<Don't worry, Nala. Just watch, and I'll show you how I fish.
<
Player_002_choice_000_f!I'm great at it, so you'll learn.
F
Player_002_choice_001_f+I'm okay at it, so we'll practice together.
<
Player_002_choice_002_f!Fair warning. I'm TERRIBLE at it.
C

Nala_026_f5Lead the way. Hope you're as good as you say you are.
G

Nala_029_f9I'll try to <Lore>catch some fish</Lore> to show you how.
p

Nala_004_fbAnd maybe I'll even <Lore>catch a few Rare or Unique Fish</Lore> so you can see it's not so tough.
`

Nala_027_fRThat sounds good. I helped you learn to pounce. Now you can help me learn to fish.
?

Nala_028_f1I'm sure you're not that bad. But let's find out.
:

Nala_020_f,Is that all? Lions need much more than that.
>

Nala_021_f0That doesn't exactly sound like food for a lion.
a

Nala_009_fSIt's fairly simple. You lie down flat then leap forward when something comes along.
.

Nala_012_f Is that some kind of water hole?
`

Nala_013_fRKind of. But I guess we don't have one of those in the Valley. Just Goofy's Stall.
X

Nala_014_fJYou can't always rely on that for food. Someone around here needs to hunt.
9

Nala_002_f+It looks right. Okay, we're ready to start.
R

Nala_003_fDThey look fine to me. Or at least good enough for us to get started.
