Grr! Roar!

Nala_003_f.Trust me. I probably wouldn't taste very good!
c

Nala_044_fUThey've been tracking me ever since my mate Simba and I set out from the Pride Lands.
:

Nala_019_f,Hmm. Maybe I could help you get rid of them.
Q

Nala_020_fCWell, you can either do that or keep out of my way. It's up to you.

Nala_021_fMy name's Nala, by the way.

Player_001_choice_000_fWhat are you doing out here?
9
Player_001_choice_001_fTell me more about the hyenas.

Player_001_choice_002_fWhat can I do to help?

Nala_015_f%Grrr... You don't seem threatening...


Nala_011_fYou can talk!


Nala_013_f
Of course.
(

Nala_014_fAnd you can understand me!
H

Nala_012_f:Heh. I guess that means you're really not going to eat me?
S

Nala_007_fEI was just trying to scare you off. I thought you were another hyena.
+

Nala_017_fThere are hyenas around here?
e

Nala_018_fWYou see those eyes glowing in the darkness all around us? There's a whole pack of them.
‡

Nala_025_fyTrying to get a little rest. Simba's king of the Pride Lands, and we needed a bit of a break from all the royal... stuff.
j

Nala_024_f\He wanted to show me more of the jungle where he grew up with his friends, Timon and Pumbaa.
Y

Nala_026_fKWe got separated not long ago, and I'm supposed to meet him in this jungle.
K

Nala_027_f=But I don't want to lead a pack of angry hyenas right to him.
\

Nala_028_fNThe hyenas have been mad at us ever since we forced them away from Pride Rock.
s

Nala_029_feTheir numbers are dwindling. There aren't as many as there were back when their leader Scar was here.
K

Nala_030_f=But there are still enough of them to cause a lot of trouble.
2

Nala_023_f$We need to throw them off our trail.
O

Nala_032_fAI can hold the hyenas off for a bit. But there are a lot of them.
F

Nala_043_f8I don't know what that is, but you can explain it later.
`

Nala_040_fRI'll hold off the hyenas as long as I can. I just hope you know what you're doing.
`

Nala_033_fRIf there were some way to block the path so they can't follow us, that would help.
u

Nala_034_fgThere are a lot of thorn bushes around here. I'll bet the hyenas wouldn't want to get tangled in those.
Q

Nala_035_fCThey wouldn't. But how would we get them to the middle of the path?
I

Nala_036_f;Aha. I bet my trusty Watering Can might be able to help us.
,

Nala_038_fYou sure that's going to work?
@

Nala_039_f2You're just going to have to trust me on this one.


Nala_037_fsIf you can hold off those hyenas, I'll <Lore>plant some seeds for the thorns and water them until they grow.</Lore>
>

Nala_041_f0Don't worry. It shouldn't take long. It's magic.
T

Nala_031_fFBefore we go any farther, we need to throw those hyenas off our trail.
l

Nala_022_f^I'm supposed to meet Simba somewhere in that jungle. But I can't lead the hyenas right to him.
r

Nala_004_fdI promise I'll find you some very large catnip and a scratching post if you just keep your distance!
a

Nala_016_fSWhat are you talking about...? Never mind. I'll keep my distance if you keep yours.
E

Nala_005_f7You think you're the only one who can roar around here?
4

Nala_006_f&Grrr! Roar! Be afraid! Be very afraid!
,

Nala_008_fWas that supposed to scare me?
5

Nala_009_f'You sound like Simba when he was a cub.

Nala_010_f"Hey! I thought I sounded prettyâ€”
