Nala_005_f={PlayerName}, I found something strange on one of my patrols.
N

Nala_007_f@I've been trying to figure it out, but I think I need your help.

Player_000_choice_000_fSure. What did you find?
1
Player_000_choice_001_fMaybe some other time.
_

Nala_008_fQI was patrolling near Skull Rock off Dazzle Beach when I smelled something odd...

Nala_010_f%My whiskers even started twitching...
)
Player_001_choice_000_fStrange smell?
.
Player_001_choice_001_fWhiskers twitching?
.
Player_001_choice_002_fWhat happened next?
d

Nala_011_fVIt reminded me of when Simba and I were young, and we explored the Elephant Graveyard.
C

Nala_012_f5It was... musty. Like something just starting to rot.
ƒ

Nala_015_fuI got closer to investigate and found something buried in the ground. The tide had washed away the sand on top of it.
R

Nala_016_fDSo I dug it out. It was a small, brown thing that looked like... me.
>
Player_002_choice_000_f#Like some sort of mystical idol...?
-
Player_002_choice_001_fLike a decoration?
8
Player_002_choice_002_fLike... a Nala action figure?
‡

Nala_017_fyI'm not sure what you mean. Rafiki used to make pictures of animals, but this didn't look like anything I've seen before.
E

Nala_022_f7When I was digging it out, I scratched it with my claw.
r

Nala_023_fdSparks came out of it. Like it was going to catch fire. And my whiskers started twitching even more.

Nala_024_f'That's when I decided to come find you.
4
Player_003_f$Sounds like another magical mystery.
H
Player_003_choice_001_f-Don't worry. You've come to the right person.
J
Player_003_choice_002_f/I'm no expert, but I'll do my best to help you.
C
Player_003_choice_003_f(Uh, maybe you should ask Merlin instead.
\

Nala_025_fNI thought so. You've solved so many problems like this for your pride already.
a

Nala_028_fSOkay. I'll go <Lore>find this strange thing on Skull Rock near Dazzle Beach.</Lore>
r

Nala_026_fdI know you will. Trust in yourself. You've solved so many problems like this for your pride already.
Z

Nala_027_fLI don't want to bother Merlin until I know for sure what we're dealing with.
h

Nala_018_fZYou mean the colorful things around the dwellings here? No. I think it was more than that.


Nala_019_fWhat's that?
h

Nala_020_fZIt's like a toy we humans play with. They come with lots of features and moveable parts...
9

Nala_021_f+Oh. No, I don't think that's what this was.
R

Nala_013_fDIt was almost like there was a whole stampede of wildebeests nearby.
>

Nala_014_f0But there wasn't anything. It was just peaceful.
b

Nala_009_fTOf course. Maybe I'll ask Merlin. This seems like it's more his territory than mine.
