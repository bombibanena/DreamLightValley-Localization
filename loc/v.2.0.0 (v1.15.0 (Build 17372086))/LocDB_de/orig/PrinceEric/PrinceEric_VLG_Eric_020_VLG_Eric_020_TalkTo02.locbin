PrinceEric_004_f!Did you learn anything from Maui?
š
PrinceEric_002_f…He told me we need to enchant an object. I put together everything we need for the spell... except for the object we need to enchant.
A
PrinceEric_000_f-Enchanting an object? That sounds familiar...

PrinceEric_001_fbWait! Ursula! When she made a deal with Ariel for her voice, Ursula used a Nautilus shell pendant.
a
PrinceEric_007_fMIt allowed her to speak with Ariel's voice. So we know they can be enchanted!

Player_000_choice_001_fIs that an octopus snail?
<
Player_000_choice_002_f!I've never fished one out before.

PrinceEric_008_fOIt won't be easy; they live deep under the waves, but maybe we can lure one up.

PrinceEric_013_f´They're scavengers. We'll need something that smells awful, like it comes from the depths of the ocean. I have this <ActivityItem>Fish Gut Oil</ActivityItem> sailors sometimes use.

PrinceEric_011_fXMaybe we can combine it with some other Ingredients... But I'm not sure what would work.

Player_001_f+I'll ask Remy. He knows everything about...

Player_001_choice_000_f...how to put together flavors.

Player_001_choice_001_f...seafood.

PrinceEric_003_fqThat's great! Here, take the <ActivityItem>Fish Gut Oil</ActivityItem> with you. And thanks again for helping me.
C
PrinceEric_009_f/That's a pretty good description, {PlayerName}.
d
PrinceEric_010_fPThat's not surprising. They're rare on the surface but maybe we can lure one up.
