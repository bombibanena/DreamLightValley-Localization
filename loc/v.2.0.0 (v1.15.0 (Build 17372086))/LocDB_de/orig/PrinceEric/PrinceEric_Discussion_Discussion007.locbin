PrinceEric_000_f'Settle a question for me, {PlayerName}.
T
PrinceEric_001_f@I love sailing big ships. Galleons, with a crew and three masts.
\
PrinceEric_002_fHBut Moana says there's nothing like skimming the waves in a small canoe.
E
PrinceEric_003_f1Which do you prefer? A big ship or a small canoe?

Big ships.
(
Player_000_choice_001_fSmall canoes.
&
Player_000_choice_002_fIt depends.
I
PrinceEric_005_f5That's how I feel. I like a solid deck under my feet.
T
PrinceEric_008_f@And bigger ships means you can haul more, and carry more people.
j
PrinceEric_009_fVBut maybe I'm just more comfortable with large ships because they're what I'm used to.
S
PrinceEric_004_f?Yeah? Well, they are useful. I can't deny that. Light and fast.
`
PrinceEric_007_fLMoana offered to teach me how to sail one. Maybe I should take her up on it.
]
PrinceEric_006_fII guess you're right. Different kinds of boats work for different things.
F
PrinceEric_010_f2My kingdom needs large ships to carry trade cargo.
X
PrinceEric_011_fDBut Moana's canoe is perfect for navigating between smaller islands.

PrinceEric_012_f!We're lucky we have both options.
