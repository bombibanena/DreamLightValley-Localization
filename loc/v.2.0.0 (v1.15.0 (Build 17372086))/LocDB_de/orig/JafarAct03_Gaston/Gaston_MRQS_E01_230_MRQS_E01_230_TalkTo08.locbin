Gaston_000_fO{PlayerName}, I'm not convinced the way you're running this Island is the best.
O
Gaston_001_f?I've made a list of all the ways you could improve things here.

L
Player_000_choice_001_f1Instead of that... why not help me out right now?
i
Gaston_002_fYFirst, I don't like how things keep turning black and white. I suggest you stop all that.

Gaston_003_f€Next, Eternity Isle needs more statues of me. One in Ancient's Landing, one in the Glittering Dunes, and one in the Wild Tangle.

Player_001_choice_000_fAnything else?
N
Player_001_choice_001_f3Okay, that's enough. How about you help me out now?
©
Gaston_004_f˜Yes! THIRDLY, the names of things around this Isle need to change. I was thinking of "Gaston's Landing," the "Gastonian Dunes," and the "Tangle Gaston."
„
Gaston_005_ftFourthly, "Eternity Isle"? Please! Everyone should be calling the place "Gaston." Or maybe "Gaston's Eternity Isle"!

¹
Gaston_006_f¨Hardly! Let me see... more sidekicks for me... daily performances to celebrate my feats... some sort of contraption to funnel eggs directly into my mouth even faster...
‹
Gaston_007_f{Ooh. Belle's love and admiration given only to me. That would improve things around here quite a bit, if you can manage it.
s
Gaston_008_fcWhy don't we circle back to all that once we fix the more pressing issues around the Isle together?

Gaston_009_f)Hmm... all right. Fine. What do you need?
a
Gaston_010_fQThose black and white rifts around Eternity Isle... I need YOUR help to fix them.
