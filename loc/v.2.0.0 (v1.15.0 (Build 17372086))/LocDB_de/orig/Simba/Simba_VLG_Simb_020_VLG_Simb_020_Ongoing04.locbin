Simba_010_f†Could we plant and grow some <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem> in the Meadow for the Rabbits? I know that'll make Nala feel better.

Simba_001_f{Oh, and you also wanted to feed some of the other animals in the Valley. Do you need some pointers on how to approach them?
'
Player_000_choice_000_fYes, please!
A
Player_000_choice_001_f&I'm good. Let's go feed some critters!

Simba_002_f/Great! Which creatures do you wanna know about?

Player_001_choice_000_fThe squirrels and sunbirds.

Player_001_choice_001_fThe rabbits or the foxes.
;
Player_001_choice_002_f The baby turtles and the ravens.

Simba_003_f:Oh, they don't fear anyone. They'll think you're a friend.

Simba_000_f)Just go to them. It won't be any trouble.

Simba_004_f$Oh, those guys love to run and play.
Y
Simba_011_fJYou'll have to join their game and catch them if you wanna give them food.

Simba_005_fYIt's funny. You'd think turtles and ravens wouldn't have anything in common, but they do.
P
Simba_006_fAThey're both shy, so it'll take time for them to get used to you.
n
Simba_012_f_Just stand near them calmly. That way, they'll know there's nothing to fear, and they'll relax.

Simba_007_fmOh, they're the most wary of creatures in the Valley. You need to be pretty careful when you approach them...
J
Simba_013_f;When you see them watching their surroundings, stop moving.
~
Simba_008_foOnly move again when you see they're relaxed... but stop as soon as you see them about to stand on guard again.
U
Simba_009_fFOkay. And hey, don't hesitate to ask me again if you change your mind.
