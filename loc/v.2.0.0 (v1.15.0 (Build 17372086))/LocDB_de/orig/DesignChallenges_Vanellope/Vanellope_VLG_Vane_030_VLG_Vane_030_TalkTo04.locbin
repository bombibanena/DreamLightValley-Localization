Vanellope_000_fTHey, so I didn't get any cool power-ups... Turns out the Tree Witch was a total dud.

Player_000_choice_002_f$She walked away? That means you won!
¦
Vanellope_001_f’Pff, don't worry. I've been to the Internet and played games there. I've finished tutorials more dangerous than some cranky swamp lady. Besides...

Vanellope_002_fmYou have your Pixel Sword, and we have the experience. I think we're ready to take on the Final Boss... Scar!

Vanellope_003_f%Scar? What makes Scar the final boss?

Vanellope_004_f'Uh, his lair is a GINORMOUS SKULL. Duh!

Player_001_choice_001_f/I'm not ready to enter the actual lion's den...

Vanellope_005_fWoo-hoo! Game on, {PlayerName}!

Vanellope_006_f\Here's what I'm thinking... We make a lure to bring him into his lair... and then we attack.

Vanellope_007_f±I've been playing a LOT of Extreme Fishing lately. So I know we'll need <ActivityItem>Herring</ActivityItem> for the trap because they're super stinky! Perfect for a scent lure!
¢
Vanellope_008_fŽWe'll also need a <ActivityItem>Kingfish</ActivityItem> to catch a wannabe king! Pretty sure you can find those on Dazzle Beach late at night.
’
Vanellope_009_fAnd... uh... some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Fiber</ActivityItem> to put the whole thing together.

Vanellope_010_fW<Lore>Build the Scar Lure and place it near his den.</Lore> Then, pow! Final Boss time!

Vanellope_011_f)Sure you are! We just need a good plan...

Vanellope_012_fSo am I! For victory!

Vanellope_013_f<No way! We're just getting to the good part. The FINAL BOSS!

Vanellope_014_fGKind of a hollow victory against an unthreatening swamp lady. Anyway...
