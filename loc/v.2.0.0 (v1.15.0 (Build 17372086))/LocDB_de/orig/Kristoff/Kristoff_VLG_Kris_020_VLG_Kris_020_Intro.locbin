Kristoff_010_fMHey, {PlayerName}, I've got kind of a strange problem. I could use some help.
.
Player_002_choice_000_fTell me everything.
5
Player_002_choice_001_fI'll help some other time.
v
Kristoff_000_fdWell, you remember that spell we did that took away my memories of Anna to help save the Village...?

Kristoff_001_foSome of my memories are starting to come back, but not many of them. And I can tell it's breaking Anna's heart.
>
Kristoff_002_f,Have you ever forgotten something important?
8
Player_000_choice_000_fI forgot an anniversary once.
8
Player_000_choice_001_fI think I forgot this Valley.
!
Player_000_choice_002_fNever.
M
Kristoff_003_f;That's pretty bad. Hope you didn't get in too much trouble.
[
Kristoff_004_fIIf Anna and I have anniversaries, I don't even remember what they're for.
W
Kristoff_012_fESay... you don't remember Anna, but do you remember her sister, Elsa?
8
Kristoff_013_f&Huh. That's funny. I do remember Elsa!
…
Kristoff_008_fsBut in all my memories of her, it's like... parts are foggy. I know someone else was with us. I just can't see who.
d
Kristoff_014_fRMaybe if you've still got memories of Elsa, and she's still got memories of you...
i
Kristoff_015_fW...she could help fill in what's missing from your memories with Anna. I'll go ask her.
a
Kristoff_016_fOIt's worth a try, {PlayerName}. Thanks. Let me know if Elsa thinks of anything.
?
Kristoff_005_f-Oh. Wow. That's a pretty big thing to forget.
G
Kristoff_006_f5You've never forgotten something important? You sure?
?
Kristoff_007_f-Maybe you've forgotten what you've forgotten.
_
Kristoff_011_fMOh, sure. Don't worry. I don't think this problem's going away any time soon.
