Kristoff_000_f4Oh hey! You're back... with a face made of stone...?
?
Kristoff_001_f-Whoa! Now I remember! Prince Eric! Of course!
P
Kristoff_003_f>That's not him, is it?! He didn't get turned to stone, did he?
2
Player_001_choice_000_fNo. It's just a statue.
,
Player_001_choice_001_fUh... I hope not.
6
Player_001_choice_002_fDon't even joke about that.
9
Kristoff_008_f'Phew! That's good. Where'd you find it?
m
Kristoff_011_f[I found it in the waters just off Dazzle Beach. It must have been on Eric's ship that sank.
ß
Kristoff_007_fîWait a second... it's all coming back to me now. Right after the storm, Donald and I scoured Dazzle Beach looking for anything that was on the ship.
`
Kristoff_005_fNAnd now that I think about it... Eric was with us, helping us! I remember now!
>
Player_001_choice_003_f#So he made it out of the shipwreck!

Player_001_choice_004_fWhere did he go after that?

Kristoff_006_fYeah!
ñ
Kristoff_013_fÉIt was all right before the Forgetting. Maybe some of the other Villagers would remember where he went if they saw the full statue.
J
Kristoff_002_f8I kept the one piece we found and Donald has the others.
£
Kristoff_004_fêThink I used mine as a paperweight... What? It's heavy, and it holds down papers. It's all yours if you can find it. It's somewhere in my House.

Kristoff_012_fNo idea.
;
Kristoff_009_f)Yeah, me too. So, where'd that come from?
o
Kristoff_010_f]I wasn't! There's so much magic around here, you never know. So, where'd you find that thing?
