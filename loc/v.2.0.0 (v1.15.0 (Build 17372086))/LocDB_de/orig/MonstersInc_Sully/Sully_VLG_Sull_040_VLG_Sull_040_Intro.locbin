Sully_002_f&What class are you teaching this time?
j
Sully_004_f[Nope. Not a class... It's a scavenger hunt! And I could really use your help organizing it.

C
Sully_005_f4Thanks, {PlayerName}! And thanks for the enthusiasm!
`
Sully_009_fQI thought of a few Villagers who seem like they might be... well, young at heart.
J
Sully_010_f;Could ya ask 'em for me while I hide the rest of the clues?

Sully_013_f!Yeah, that's what I thought, too.
z
Sully_014_fkSomeone in the hunt with a short fuse could be a good thing. We'll know right away if it's too frustrating.
P
Sully_016_fAYou can invite Donald if you like, or not. I trust your judgment.
