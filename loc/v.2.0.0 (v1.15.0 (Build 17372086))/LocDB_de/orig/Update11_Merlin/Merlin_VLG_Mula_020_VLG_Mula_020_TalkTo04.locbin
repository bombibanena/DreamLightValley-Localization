Merlin_001_fAh, {PlayerName}! I've heard a most interesting rumor. You're joining Mulan and Mushu to bring shadow plays back to the Valley?
P
Merlin_002_f@We're trying, but we're having some problems with the lantern...
;
Merlin_003_f+I suppose it won't stay lit; is that right?

Player_000_choice_000_fYes, can you help us?

Player_000_choice_001_f#Do you have a spell for perma-fire?

Player_000_choice_002_fMerlin, do you know EVERYTHING?
ª
Merlin_004_f™Naturally! What you seek is a <ActivityItem>Draconic Garnet</ActivityItem> â€” a special gem that, when filled with Mushu's Guardian fire, burns eternal!
ª
Merlin_013_f™We had one before the Forgetting, but I'm afraid I used it in one of my experimental attempts to stop the Night Thorns... Singed my beard a bit, in fact.
^
Merlin_005_fNBut I have no doubt with your usual talent you'll be able to create a new one!
¦
Merlin_006_f•Once you collect the odds and ends to craft the <ActivityItem>Empty Draconic Garnet</ActivityItem>, bring it to Mushu so he can breathe fire into it.
Z
Merlin_000_fJMagical fire? I should think not! Such a thing would be FAR too dangerous.
œ
Merlin_012_f‹You must create a <ActivityItem>Draconic Garnet</ActivityItem>. It's a gem that Mushu can fill with his fire, and then it will burn safely.

Merlin_010_feNo, but I SEEK to know and understand all I can. That's what keeps MY lantern burning, you might say.
