MotherGothel_008_f¼Just who I was hoping to see! Darling, tell me you've noticed all those ugly Night Thorns sprouting around the Valley. And how some of the Villagers are starting to lose their memories...?
O
MotherGothel_009_f9Merlin hasn't the faintest clue what might be causing it.
L

b
MotherGothel_018_fLOh, you aren't nearly as clever as you think you are. It really is annoying.
