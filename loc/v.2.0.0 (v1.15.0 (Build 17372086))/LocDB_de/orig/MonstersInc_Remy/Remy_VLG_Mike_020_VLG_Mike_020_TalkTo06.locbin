Remy_001_f'Oh? Breaking new ground? Interesting...
 

Remy_011_fYou're telling me!
E

Remy_012_f7From the conversations I've had with Mike and Sulley...
?

Remy_013_f1I wonder if they have an expanded range of taste.
<
Player_002_choice_000_f!Expanded range? What do you mean?
J
Player_002_choice_001_f/I'll let them worry about their own taste buds.

Remy_003_f0I'm helping Mike Wazowski with a little project.

Remy_004_fQWe need a fish, one that might be a little aged. Think you might be able to help?
C

Remy_005_f5Sure! Are you doing some experiments in fermentation?
'

Remy_006_fYou might call it that...
W

Remy_007_fIThat's fantastic! Are you making some surstrÃ¶ming? Maybe some funazushi?
V

Remy_008_fHJust about every culture around the world uses fermentation in some way.

Remy_015_f>Well, we all have specific tastes â€” sweet, salty, sour, etc.

Remy_017_fcWhat if what we think of as "gross" is just another taste to them the way bitter or umami is to us?
:
Player_001_choice_000_fI think you're on to something.
?
Player_001_choice_001_f$I'm okay with my current taste buds.

Remy_018_fAnyway, here's that fish.

Remy_019_f¡Haven't had a lot of seafood orders the past couple days, so it's past its prime. I was just about to put it in the compost. Hopefully, it'll work for your plan.

Remy_020_fUGreat, thanks Remy! I'll... try and breathe through my mouth while dealing with this.


Remy_014_fI get that.
