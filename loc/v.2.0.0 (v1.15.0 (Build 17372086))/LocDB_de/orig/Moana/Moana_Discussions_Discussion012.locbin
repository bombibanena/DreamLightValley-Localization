Moana_000_fMHey, {PlayerName}! I was exploring some of the caves on Dazzle Beach earlier.
{
Moana_001_flIf you haven't visited them already, you definitely should. Some of the artifacts in there are so beautiful!
'
Moana_003_fI wonder who built them.
"
Player_000_choice_000_fMerlin?
!
Player_000_choice_001_fGoofy?

Player_000_choice_002_fSomebody we don't know.
)
Moana_002_fI asked Merlin about them.
O
Moana_004_f@He kept muttering "Curious, curious..." and went to his library.
+
Moana_005_fSo I don't think it was him.
\
Moana_006_fMHm, I don't think Goofy would build something like what I saw in those caves.
;
Moana_007_f,But I'll ask him. Maybe he knows about them.

Moana_008_f‡You're probably right. Whoever built the artifacts in those caves must've lived here a really long time ago, before any of us got here.
&
Moana_010_fI wonder who they were?
q
Moana_009_fbWe should be careful not to disturb anything down there... but it's amazing to see what they made.
