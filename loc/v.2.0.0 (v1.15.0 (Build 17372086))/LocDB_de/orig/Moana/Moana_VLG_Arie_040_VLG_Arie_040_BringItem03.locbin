Moana_000_f;Hey, {PlayerName}. What's that <Lore>Stone Slab</Lore> for?
@
Moana_007_f1Well, I have sort of a weird question to ask you.
 
Moana_006_fSure. What is it?
ê
Moana_010_fÄI need you to hold on to that <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> and tell me how you feel when you go sailing on the ocean.
V
Moana_011_fGOkay. That's a little strange, but I always love to talk about sailing.
õ
Moana_001_fãWhen I'm out on the ocean with the salt air whipping around me and the wind in my sails, headed for the horizon, I know I'm where I belong.

Player_001_choice_001_f!...scary! I'll stick to dry land.

Moana_014_frHey... that <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> you gave me... It's starting to glow. Does that mean I helped?
h
Moana_015_fYYes! It worked! Now I just need to find somebody who's got <Lore>Seething Anger</Lore>...
i
Moana_004_fZ<Lore>Seething Anger</Lore>? Well, Ursula gets pretty mad if you mention Ariel around her.

Moana_016_fUrsula! That's a great idea.

Moana_013_fHIt can be at first, but once you know what you're doing, it's fantastic!
