Merida_002_f4I hear you've been exploring Mythopia, {PlayerName}.
M
Merida_003_f=Who knows; perhaps you'll earn your own place in the legends.
X
Player_000_choice_000_f=Hmmm... "{PlayerName}, hero of legend" does have a nice ring.
o
Player_000_choice_002_fTI hope it isn't the kind of legend where I'm turned to stone or chained to a rock...
E
Merida_014_f5Aye, I can even hear the ballad they'll sing for you!
^
Merida_019_fNWell, is there anything *I* can do to help you earn your place in the legends?
=
Merida_006_f-Actually, you can. I stumbled upon something.
S
Merida_007_fCIt was a gateway to another trial, just like the ones in Everafter.
P
Merida_008_f@But it seems that this one is caused by Hades... not Maleficent.
U
Merida_009_fEOch! I found that same one back before all that ink flooded the land!
V
Merida_010_fFThe one near those huge statues of the funny horses with wings, right?
-
Merida_011_fLet's <Lore>go see it</Lore>!
s
Merida_012_fcIt looked like a kind of gateway, filled with ink. The Lorekeeper told me that it's a Mythic Trial.
~
Merida_015_fnHmm... I don't know much about the legends and myths that make up Mythopia. Only what the Lorekeeper tells me.
G
Merida_016_f7But the ones I DO know have some dark twists and turns.
`
Merida_017_fPRemind me to tell you about the beasts they say live in the depths of our lochs!
q
Merida_018_faKelpies, selkies, monsters â€” not the sorts of things you want to run into on an evening stroll.
\
Merida_021_fLI haven't run into anything like that! But I did find something interesting.
