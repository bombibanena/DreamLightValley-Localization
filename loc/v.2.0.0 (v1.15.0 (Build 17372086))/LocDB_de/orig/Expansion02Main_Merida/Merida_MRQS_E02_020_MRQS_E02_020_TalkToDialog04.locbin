Merida_000_f/*SIGH* I know just what you're going to ask me.
H
Merida_001_f8You want to know if I got those fountains working again.
?
Player_000_choice_000_f$Just wanted to see how you're doing.
U
Player_000_choice_001_f:Should I not ask? I'm getting the feeling I shouldn't ask.
G
Player_000_choice_002_f,... Did you get the fountains working again?

Merida_002_f"Oh. Well, I'm glad you asked that.
ù
Merida_003_fåAt the moment, I'm doing poorly because I still can't figure out what the problem is with these gammy fountains or how to turn them back on!

Merida_006_ffBut I did find something rather interesting. There's a secret room hidden here, underneath the bridge.

Player_001_choice_000_fWhy didn't you open with that?!
@
Player_001_choice_001_f%Can we deal with one thing at a time?
M
Player_001_choice_002_f2Secret rooms are way cooler than broken fountains.

Merida_007_fWell, I'm telling you now!
Ä
Merida_010_fpCome on. Let's go explore it together. Just in case there's anything dangerous, we can watch each other's backs.
e
Merida_008_fUI've been trying to deal with the fountains so long I think I need a break from them.
&
Merida_009_fI couldn't agree more!

Merida_004_fMYou're right, you shouldn't have asked. But since you sort of asked anyway...
ú
Merida_005_fã...NO! I haven't been able to get these gammy fountains workin' again because I can't figure out what's wrong with them in the first place!
