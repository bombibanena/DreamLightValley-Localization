Merida_005_fvIt's good you're here, {PlayerName}! Hades is up to one of his schemes. I don't suppose you'd want to help me foil it?

Player_000_choice_000_fI'd love nothing more!
C
Player_000_choice_001_f(I'm not really in a scheme-foiling mood.
M
Merida_006_f=So, Hades came to me and asked me to help him find something.
F
Merida_007_f6Something I supposedly hid back before the Forgetting.
p
Merida_008_f`It's somewhere in the Vale, and it's an artifact that lets whoever holds it "change their fate."
D
Merida_009_f4He said it's an artifact connected to Clan DunBroch!
G
Player_001_choice_000_f,Why would someone want to change their fate?
;
Player_001_choice_001_f Ooh. I'd love to change my fate.

Player_001_choice_002_f"We've got to find it before Hades.
N
Merida_010_f>I don't know. Maybe because they don't like their fate so far.
d
Merida_013_fTBut since we're talking about Hades, it's probably just because he wants more power.

Merida_014_fŸI've got some old bags in my House from before the Neverafter that might have a clue to the artifact. Would ya help me <Lore>search my House for a clue</Lore>?
G
Merida_011_f7Aye, everyone ought to be in command of their own fate.

d
Merida_015_fTAll right. I'll keep looking into it on my own. Let me know if you change your mind.
