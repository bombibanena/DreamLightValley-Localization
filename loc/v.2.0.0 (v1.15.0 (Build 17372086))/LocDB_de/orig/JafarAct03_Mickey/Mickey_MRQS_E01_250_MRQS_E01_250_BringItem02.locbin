Mickey_000_fqThis is so weird... all of these things... they're <Lore>the things I made with you, Gaston, and Rapunzel</Lore>!
#
Mickey_001_fHuh. That is weird.
`
Mickey_002_fPWait... What did Merlin say about the Spark's magic bein' all about imagination?
<
Mickey_003_f,Maybe that's the key to gettin' out of here!
F
Mickey_004_f6That's the key to it all. That's how we'll beat Jafar.
n
Mickey_005_f^It's not about being stronger or smarter or more cunning or any of those things. It's about...

Player_000_choice_000_f...unleashing our creativity!
H
Player_000_choice_001_f-...using our imaginations to help each other.
;
Player_000_choice_002_f ...sharing the things we create.
~
Mickey_006_fnIt seems like the only thing Jafar can use his imagination for is thinking of ways to get power for himself...
E
Mickey_007_f5Maybe THAT'S why he can't use the magic of the Spark!
z
Mickey_008_fjWell, then let's put our heads together and get creative! What do ya think we could use all this to build?
4
Player_001_choice_000_fA very, very tall ladder?
5
Player_001_choice_001_fSome sorta flying machine?
|
Mickey_009_flGosh, even if we had enough stuff to build a ladder that tall, I don't think it would be very safe to climb.
=
Mickey_010_f-All right then... How about a flying machine?
C
Mickey_011_f3<Lore>A flying machine</Lore>? That's a great idea!
A
Mickey_012_f1We could sit inside <Lore>Gaston's ship</Lore>...
k
Mickey_013_f[...attach <Lore>Rapunzel's lanterns</Lore> to the top and use 'em like a hot air balloon...
Z
Mickey_014_fJ...and use my <Lore>Hot Dog Cart</Lore> for the heat to power the balloon!
/
Player_002_choice_000_fThat's a great idea!
E
Player_002_choice_001_f*Sounds plain crazy. Let's hope this works.
C
Player_002_choice_002_f(I'm not flying in something like that!!!
^
Mickey_017_fNAw shucks, thanks! Just goes to show what ya can do with a little imagination.
_
Mickey_018_fOWelp, looks like we got our work cut out for us riggin' it up. Let's get to it!
V
Mickey_019_fFI'm sure it'll hold together, as long as we use our imaginations. Heh!
E
Mickey_020_f5Gosh, {PlayerName}, I don't know what else we can do.
\
Mickey_021_fL*sigh* You're right. We'll just have to hold on tight and hope for the best.
