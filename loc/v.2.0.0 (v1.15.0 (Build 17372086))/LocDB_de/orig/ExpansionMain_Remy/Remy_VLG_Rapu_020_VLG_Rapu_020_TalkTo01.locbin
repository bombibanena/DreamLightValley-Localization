Remy_000_fKHey, Remy! Rapunzel said you seemed a little down today... Everything okay?
>

Remy_001_f0She said that? Oh... this must be about earlier.
ü

Remy_002_fêShe was asking about my dreams. I told her I always wanted to open a restaurant, but now I've done that a couple of times. And I'm happy, but...
ä

Remy_005_f|I've mastered all the recipes in my repertoire, and Merlin doesn't have cookbooks that don't use eye-of-newt or time travel.
Å

Remy_003_fsGuess I'm kinda missing that cheesy, lightning-bolt roasted mushroom discovery feeling... Does that make any sense?
:
Player_000_choice_000_fYou need to cook something new!

Player_000_choice_001_fYou need to get inspired.
;
Player_000_choice_002_f Merlin has some great cookbooks.
 

Remy_007_fExactly. But when?
Å

Remy_009_fsI have recipes I could try, but I'm running two restaurants in the Valley now. Not a lot of time for experimenting.


Remy_011_fqWhat if I cooked one of the recipes for you? Maybe tasting something new will help you get your inspiration back?
}

Remy_012_foHmm... Well, you are a great cook, {PlayerName}. If anyone could help me get inspired, I know it's you! Here...
ö

Remy_013_fãTake this recipe. I've never made it, but it's pretty interesting, has nothing to do with butter, and it's spicy. Which is always exciting.
,
Player_001_choice_000_fYou got it, chef!

Player_001_choice_001_fYour dream meal is on the way!

Player_001_choice_002_f What do you have against butter?

Remy_015_fThanks, pal!

Remy_017_f(I've got to get back to work. Good luck!

Remy_014_f&Thanks, {PlayerName}. Go be inspiring!
l

Remy_016_f^Nothing! I LOVE butter! It's the backbone of French cooking. I just want to try something new.

Remy_006_fOYou're right, but you can't just pick inspiration off a tree like a cosmic fig!

Remy_008_fDThey seem more like potion recipes. Not really what I'm looking for.
