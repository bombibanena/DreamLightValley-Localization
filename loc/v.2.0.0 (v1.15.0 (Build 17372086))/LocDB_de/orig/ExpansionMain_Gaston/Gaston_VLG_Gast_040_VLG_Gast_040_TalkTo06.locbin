Player_001_choice_000_fAww, that's adorable!
P
Player_001_choice_001_f5Oof, that's not exactly buttering you up LeFou-style.

Gaston_009_f$I don't need adorable in a sidekick!
t
Gaston_020_fdHe clearly doesn't understand that compliments are meant to make one person stand out from the rest.
t
Gaston_021_fdHow will other people understand that I'm better than they are if Olaf compliments everyone equally?
L
Player_003_choice_000_f1Yeah, I see why you wouldn't be happy about that.
E
Player_003_choice_001_f*Gaston, I don't think you understand Olaf.
h
Gaston_011_fXStill, he is the appropriate size for a sidekick. And he does have an interest in music.

Gaston_014_fWhat about Olaf? How'd he do?

Gaston_019_f BUT... he complimented EVERYONE!
<
Gaston_022_f,He was doing so well, but then... ruined it!
L
Gaston_024_f<Well, you still have to pick a winner. Who's it going to be?
!
Gaston_025_fI... am not sure.
Y
Player_004_choice_000_f>Gaston not being sure about something?! You feeling all right?
:
Player_004_choice_001_fIt's definitely a tough choice!
.
Gaston_026_fI know, I'm surprised as well.
h
Gaston_030_fXYou have to help me, {PlayerName}. Who do you think would make the best sidekick for me?
%
Gaston_031_fHmm, tricky question.

Gaston_032_fQuite!
