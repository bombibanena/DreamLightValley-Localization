Gaston_003_fHey Gaston, what's new?
7
Gaston_004_f'{PlayerName}, I've had an amazing idea.
0
Player_000_choice_000_fGreat, let's hear it!
9
Player_000_choice_001_fAaaand that's my cue to leave.
A
Gaston_005_f1I've accepted that you're not an... ideal lackey.
J
Gaston_006_f:But that doesn't change the fact that I am in need of one.
S
Player_001_choice_000_f8Finally, you're going to stop trying to order me around!
8
Player_001_choice_001_fSidekick, Gaston; not lackey.
(
Gaston_007_fWhat? I never said that!
Z
Gaston_010_fJRegardless... I'm going to recruit one of the Villagers to be my sidekick!
s
Gaston_011_fcAs long as "sidekick" is just your way of saying "friend"... I guess that's... relatively harmless.
,
Gaston_012_fAnd you're going to help me!
@
Player_002_choice_000_f%Of course you want my help with this.
*
Player_002_choice_001_fSure, why not?!
<
Gaston_013_f,Any ideas who you want as your new sidekick?
:
Gaston_014_f*No. I need to see if they're worthy first.
`
Gaston_015_fPI've made a list of potential Villagers, and I need you to talk to each of them.
l
Gaston_016_f\Interrogate them for me, and let me know if they have the qualities I require in a sidekick.
C
Player_003_choice_000_f(Don't judge a book by its cover, Gaston!
D
Player_003_choice_001_f)All right, if it gets you out of my hair.
)
Player_003_choice_002_fHappy to help!
6
Gaston_017_f&Of course not. Unless it has pictures.
P
Gaston_018_f@Now, I think the following Villagers could be good candidates...
Î
Gaston_019_f½<ActivityItem>Donald</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Vanellope</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Stitch</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Minnie</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Olaf</ActivityItem>.
-
Gaston_020_fBig list! And a bit random...
)
Gaston_021_fWell, I may need backups.
Y
Gaston_022_fIOkay, I'll talk to them, but don't get upset if they don't want to, okay?
<
Gaston_023_f,{PlayerName}, when have I ever gotten upset?
L
Gaston_024_f<You know what? I'm going to leave instead of answering that.
S
Gaston_025_fCHa-ha! If I didn't know better, I'd say you don't enjoy my company.

Gaston_026_f
Excellent!
%
Gaston_008_fThere's a difference?
x
Gaston_009_fhYes. Heroes have sidekicks. Lackeys are more like servants. And NO â€” I'm not going to be your servant.
R
Gaston_002_fBWell, my idea will be even more amazing the next time you come by!
