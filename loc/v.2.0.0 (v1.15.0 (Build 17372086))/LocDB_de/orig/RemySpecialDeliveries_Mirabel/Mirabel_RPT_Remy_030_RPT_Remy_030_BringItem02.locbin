Mirabel_000_f9Oh! Thank you, {PlayerName}. These meals look incredible!
†
Mirabel_001_féI wish I could eat them myself, but... if I'm gonna make friends with all those birds in the Forgotten Lands, I'd better save it all for them.

Player_000_choice_002_f2Hey, as long as somebody eats them, it's all good.

Mirabel_002_fDMy cousin Antonio wants to hear about ALL the animals in the Valley.
V
Mirabel_003_fESo, he asked me to make friends with them. But those birds are tough.

Mirabel_006_fQThanks again for your help, {PlayerName}. And please, take this for your trouble.

Mirabel_004_fùYou're telling me. Before now, I thought only my cousin Antonio could make friends with them. But thanks to these meals, I think I've got a pretty good shot.

Mirabel_005_fãDon't worry. Those birds are gonna love them. And I'll finally be able to tell Antonio that I made friends with every animal in the Valley.
