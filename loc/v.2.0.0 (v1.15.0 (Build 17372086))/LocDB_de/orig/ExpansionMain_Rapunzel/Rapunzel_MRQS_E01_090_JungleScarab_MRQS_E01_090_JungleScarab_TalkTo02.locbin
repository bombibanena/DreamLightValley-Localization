f
Rapunzel_010_fTCould be! How can I deal with this? The swarm is too thick to get through right now.

Rapunzel_009_f“And it's also odd that they're swarming like that. I wonder if the magic of your <Lore>Scarab Key</Lore> has called them here away from the desert.

Rapunzel_017_fJThere's the <Lore>Venus Flytrap</Lore> and the <Lore>Pitcher Plant</Lore>.
q
Rapunzel_018_f_If you gather enough of them, you could make some <Lore>Carnivorous Flower Arrangements</Lore>.
x
Rapunzel_019_ffThen, if you <Lore>place them by the pedestal</Lore>, I'm sure they'll take care of that scarab swarm!
