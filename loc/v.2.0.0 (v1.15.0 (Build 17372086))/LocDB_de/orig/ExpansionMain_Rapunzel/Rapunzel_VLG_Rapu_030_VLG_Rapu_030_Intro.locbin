Rapunzel_000_f5{PlayerName}, can I talk to you? It's about Mother...
/
Player_000_choice_000_fWhat did she do now?
7
Player_000_choice_001_fLet's talk about this later!
_
Rapunzel_004_fMWell, this morning she came to the tower... and she asked me to sing for her.
«
Rapunzel_005_f˜I don't know how I feel about helping her... now that I know she lied to me again. This time about the Valley. And she hid me away from the Villagers...
Y
Rapunzel_006_fGSinging for her... Helping her with my magic hair? It feels... strange.
9
Player_001_choice_000_fYou feel like she's using you.
<
Player_001_choice_001_f!I'll tell her to leave you alone.
4
Player_001_choice_002_fLet's put a curse on her!
Z
Rapunzel_008_fHYes. I've barely seen her, and then she shows up only when she needs me.
-
Rapunzel_012_fI don't think that's right.
c
Rapunzel_013_fQWhat if Mother Gothel didn't need your magic? If you didn't have to sing for her?
]
Rapunzel_014_fKOh. That would be good... I think. Our visits would certainly be different.
+
Player_002_choice_000_fI'm on the case.
*
Player_002_choice_001_fGood different?
6
Player_002_choice_002_fWhat if she stops visiting?
<
Rapunzel_016_f*Really?! What do you need? How can I help?
P
Rapunzel_019_f>First things first: Do you know where you got your magic from?
‰
Rapunzel_001_fwNo... Mother said it's something I was born with. But she hasn't always been truthful with me. Maybe you could ask her?

Rapunzel_002_f{Good idea. Don't worry, Rapunzel â€” whether you were born with your magic or it came from somewhere else, I'll find a way.

Rapunzel_015_f
I hope so.
.
Rapunzel_017_fI suppose that might happen.
y
Rapunzel_018_fgBut I'm not alone anymore. I have you and the Village... I don't need someone who only wants to use me.
p
Rapunzel_007_f^No. I don't want to never see her... I just wish I felt like she was visiting me, not my hair.
B
Rapunzel_009_f0What? Oh no! No no, just forget I said anything!
>
Rapunzel_010_f,It's okay, Rapunzel. I was joking... Mostly.
‡
Rapunzel_011_fuOh. Good! Because I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I just wish she'd come to see me... instead of my hair.
Z
Rapunzel_003_fHOh! Of course â€” just... It would be great if we could talk soon, okay?
