Scar_005_fxAh, {PlayerName}. Just who I was thinking of. By my estimations, you're doing a rather poor job ruling over this Valley.

Scar_006_f/Why, it looks to me like the sky is falling in.
W

Scar_007_fIAre you sure you wouldn't be happier with someone more cunning in charge?

Player_000_choice_001_fNice try, Scar.
N
Player_000_choice_002_f3I'll think about it. But you have to help me first.
?
Player_000_choice_003_f$Hm... someone like Mufasa, you mean?
)

Scar_008_fI've no idea what you mean.
g

Scar_013_fYBut if you haven't come here to ask me to reign over the Valley... then what DO you want?
Y

Scar_015_fKI found something in your cave. I think it used to belong to the Forgotten.
e

Scar_016_fWIt might be the key to stopping the Forgotten's plans. Do you know the story behind it?

Scar_017_f...
,

Scar_018_fNo. I've never seen it before.

Player_001_choice_000_fAre you sure?
@
Player_001_choice_001_f%Maybe the Forgetting's gotten to you.

Player_001_choice_002_f(Why do I get the vibe that you're lying?


Scar_019_fPositively.

Scar_022_fVBesides, why would I want to remember such a... such a hideous, charmless image of me.

Scar_023_f(Aha! So you admit it's a drawing of YOU!

Scar_024_f...
a

Scar_025_fSPlease, Scar. This might be the only way to stop the Forgotten and save the Valley.
n

Scar_001_f`*sigh* ... Fine. If I must, to ensure I have a kingdom left to rule over, then... I'll tell you.
d

Scar_002_fVAnd... I suppose you are the closest thing I have to a... well, to someone I tolerate.
K

Scar_028_f=You made this for me, {PlayerName}. When you were just a cub.
ƒ

Scar_029_fuIt hardly captures my likeness. But, I admit I found it rather... nice... to receive a gift. Even such a pitiful one.
&

Scar_030_fI've kept it ever since.
H

Scar_031_f:Thanks, Scar. Your story might help me stop the Forgotten.

Scar_032_f)Do have a bit of mercy for the Forgotten.

Scar_034_f#I know all too well how that feels.
`

Scar_003_fRWhatever I know about that thing... I'd sooner take it to the grave than tell you.
E

Scar_004_f7Look... maybe you don't trust me enough to tell me yet.
^

Scar_026_fPBut sooner or later, Scar... I'll show you that I'm your friend. You'll tell me.
 

Scar_027_fI highly doubt it.
F

Scar_020_f8Hardly. I recall far too much for that to have happened.
(

Scar_021_fI have absolutely no idea.
V

Scar_009_fHUgh. Yet again, I'm expected to do all the work with none of the reward.


Scar_014_fWhat do you want?

Scar_010_f%NEVER speak that name in my presence!
!

Scar_011_fEr, right... sorry.
