Minnie_000_fMOh, hello, {PlayerName}. Was Merlin any help sorting out this magical muddle?
h
Minnie_001_fXThe books he lent me had so much interesting information, but nothing that will help us.
B
Player_000_choice_000_f'Merlin gave me a very powerful spell...
D
Player_000_choice_001_f)He helped put some things in perspective.
>
Player_000_choice_002_f#We had a little misunderstanding...
,
Minnie_002_fHe did?! What sort of spell?
J
Minnie_003_f:Well, it's a spell that binds this whole Village together.
4
Player_001_f$It's a kind of magic that runs on...
)
Player_001_choice_000_f...kind words.
5
Player_001_choice_001_f...caring for one another.
@
Player_001_choice_002_f%...always being there for each other.
J
Minnie_004_f:Really? That does sound like a very special kind of magic.

Minnie_005_foMerlin got me to talk to some of the other Villagers, so we could remind you how important you are around here.
h
Minnie_006_fXElsa told me about how you're always there to listen to her whenever she needs a friend.
c
Minnie_007_fSAnd Anna told me that nobody can make her laugh like you do. ... Except maybe Olaf.
ç
Minnie_008_f}And Moana, she said that what she loves best about you is your strength of heart, and that you never give up, no matter what.
T
Minnie_009_fD... Oh my. I don't know what to say, {PlayerName}. That is so sweet.
n
Minnie_010_f^And I'm very grateful, but... how does that stop us from disappearing into the Here and There?
^
Player_002_fNBecause that's the magic, Minnie. We'll never disappear again as long as we...
?
Player_002_choice_000_f$...never stop caring for each other.
D
Player_002_choice_001_f)...always make sure everyone feels loved.
M
Player_002_choice_002_f2...always respect what's special about each other.
d
Minnie_011_fTOh. Of course! It's so simple. I'm a little embarrassed that I didn't see it before.
Ä
Minnie_012_fpWell, I guess I can return these books to Merlin. As long as you and I are here, I know everything will be okay.
P
Minnie_013_f@Because I'll always make sure everyone knows how loved they are.
"
Player_003_fAnd I'll always...

G
Player_003_choice_002_f,...solve all the weird problems around here.
 
Minnie_014_fI know you will!
5
Minnie_015_f%Oh! I just thought of something else.
‰
Minnie_016_f”I was so worried about everyone disappearing... I didn't realize how much <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> I asked you to bring me to build that <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem>. Was it too much?
-
Player_004_choice_000_fIt was no trouble!
-
Player_004_choice_001_fIt wasn't too bad.
7
Player_004_choice_002_fIT WAS SO MUCH CLAY, MINNIE.
U
Minnie_017_fEPhew! I'm glad it wasn't too much trouble for you to gather all that.
é
Minnie_018_f~To thank you, I found some <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> myself. I want you to have it so you can build whatever you like.
¡
Minnie_019_f∞And Uncle Scrooge says he's so happy that the <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem> is helping keep time in the Village that he wants to give you a little reward too.

Minnie_020_fHere you go!
^
Minnie_021_fNOh, I'm so sorry, {PlayerName}. I didn't realize how hard it would be to find.
5
Minnie_022_f%Oh! I just thought of one more thing.
u
Minnie_023_feRemember how I asked you for some help building that <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem>?
X
Minnie_024_fHI gathered up some <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> to get you started!
F
Minnie_025_f6Hopefully now it won't be too hard to gather the rest.
_
Minnie_026_fOAnd Uncle Scrooge is so excited about the project that he lent us some funding.
Q
Minnie_027_fAThere's a project that I've been wanting to do for quite a while.
W
Minnie_028_fGI gathered up some <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> to get us started!
N
Minnie_029_f>Just hold onto it, and let me know when you're ready to start!
M
Minnie_030_f=Oh, good. Merlin's so helpful that way. What did he tell you?
r
Minnie_031_fbHe told me that there's a magic more powerful than any simple spell holding this Village together.
$
Minnie_032_fYou did? About what?
†
Minnie_033_fèWell, I thought Merlin was getting me to gather stuff for some kind of spell. But it was something bigger than that. A different kind of magic.
