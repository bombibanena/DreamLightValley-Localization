Flynn_003_f%You found a magnet behind the target?
p
Flynn_004_faThat's strange. I DEFINITELY didn't sneak down here to place that before the competition started.
@
Player_000_choice_000_f%Flynn. Come on. That's a dirty trick.

Player_000_choice_001_fIf you didn't do it, who did?
8
Player_000_choice_002_fIt's kind of funny, honestly.
f
Flynn_005_fWFiiine, you're right. MAYBE I asked around about a way that I could throw off her shot.
a
Flynn_006_fRBut Merida got me first with those wanted posters. I was just returning the favor.

Player_001_choice_000_fClassic Flynn.

Player_001_choice_001_fIt was all in good fun.
Q
Player_001_choice_002_f6I'm beginning to see why Merida finds you so annoying.

Flynn_010_fExactly!
M
Flynn_013_f>I guess this means I'm disqualified from the competition, huh?
q
Flynn_014_fbThat's too bad. I was just about to pull off the amazing, one-in-a-million Flynn Rider Trick Shot.

Player_002_choice_000_fWhat's that?
4
Player_002_choice_001_fSounds extremely made up.
L
Flynn_015_f=It's a little move where I throw three apples into the air...
Å
Flynn_017_fr...then shoot an arrow from behind my back and spear all three before curving my arrow directly into the bullseye.
T
Flynn_018_fEIt's too bad you and Merida will never get to see it. Tragic, really.
*
Flynn_000_fBetter go tell her she won!
;
Flynn_016_f,Oh, it's real. And I can definitely make it.
*
Flynn_011_fWell, I thought so, anyway.
<
Flynn_012_f-But still charming, right? ... Right?! *sigh*
g
Flynn_007_fXOkay, okay, it was me. I maybe asked around about a way that I could throw off her shot.
z
Flynn_008_fkRight?! I mean, sure, it's a little underhanded. But I just asked around about a way to throw off her shot.
