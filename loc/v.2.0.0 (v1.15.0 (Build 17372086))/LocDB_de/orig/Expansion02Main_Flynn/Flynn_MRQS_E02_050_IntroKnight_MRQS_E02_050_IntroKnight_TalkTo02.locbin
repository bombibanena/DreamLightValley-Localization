Flynn_001_fSYou're wearing the knight armor! Nicely done. And may I say, it fits you perfectly.
‰
Flynn_002_fzBut... the drawbridge still isn't lowering. That means there are more things you need to do before you're really a knight.
;
Flynn_003_f,I'm thinking you need a <Lore>squire</Lore>.
+
Player_000_choice_000_fWhat's a squire?
6
Player_000_choice_001_fWhy don't you be my squire?
i
Flynn_004_fZIt's like a knight in training. A knight's apprentice. A junior assistant to the knight...
'
Flynn_005_fLook, you get it, right?
-
Flynn_007_fSo why don't you be my squire?
x
Flynn_006_fiWhoaaa! No, no, no. The squire is always an annoying little sidekick who can't stop getting into trouble.
D
Player_001_choice_000_f)C'mon, Flynn. It's just to get us inside.
1
Player_001_choice_001_fYou owe me one, Flynn!
>
Player_001_choice_002_f#Soooo, the role fits you perfectly?
"
Flynn_008_f*sigh* All right...
)
Flynn_012_fFine! I'll be your squire.
E
Flynn_013_f6Your dashing, debonair, devastatingly charming squire.
f
Flynn_014_fWNow, the next thing you need to be a knight is to <Lore>defeat a mythical beast</Lore>.
<
Player_002_f,Hmmm. Defeat a mythical beast. What about...
N
Player_002_choice_000_f3...Maleficent? She can change into a dragon, right?
N
Player_002_choice_001_f3...you? I defeated the Wolf of the Wilds, didn't I?
P
Player_002_choice_002_f5...one of those cute little dragons around Everafter?
V
Flynn_015_fGUh, for your first mythical beast, I suggest starting a little smaller.
X
Flynn_016_fISome kind of starter mythical beast. You know, just to get your feet wet.
T
Flynn_019_fEHow about those <Lore>funny little dragons</Lore> all over Everafter?
h
Flynn_021_fYTry <Lore>taming one of the small dragons</Lore>. That just might make you a real knight!
e
Flynn_017_fVHuh. I actually appreciate you calling me a mythical beast, but I don't think I count.
i
Flynn_020_fZI think your best bet would be those <Lore>funny little dragons</Lore> all over Everafter.
J
Flynn_018_f;Hmm. They are cute, aren't they? But I'm sure they'd count.

Flynn_009_f(I guess you did save me from that curse.

Flynn_010_fHey!
E
Flynn_011_f6*sigh* Though I guess you did save me from that curse.
