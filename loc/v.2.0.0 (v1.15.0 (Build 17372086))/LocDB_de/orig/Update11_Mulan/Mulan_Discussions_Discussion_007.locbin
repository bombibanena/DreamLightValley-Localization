N
Mulan_002_f?Well, Yao has a pretty short temper, and he's incredibly tough.
A
Mulan_003_f2But I know under all of that he's got a big heart.

Mulan_004_f.Chien-Po is the gentlest person I've ever met.
i
Mulan_005_fZI was worried about him going into battle, but his strength helps him look after everyone.

Mulan_006_fOWhat can I say about Ling? He's funny, and sometimes he likes to cause trouble.

Mulan_007_fiLing's always willing to put his ego aside for the bigger picture. Selfless... but kind of loud about it.
