Mirabel_000_f,So... how are Mr. McDuck and Donald feeling?
¨
Mirabel_001_föThey both just need to calm down a little. I think if we could get Mr. McDuck's <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> back, it would all be okay.
 
Mirabel_002_fThat's perfect!
ì
Mirabel_003_fÅOh, and could we also do something for the raccoons in the Forest of Valor, too? Donald really scared them with all that yelling.
w
Player_000_fgMaybe I can look around for the <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> and feed the raccoons...

Player_000_choice_000_fI love those little creatures.
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$But they're really hard to approach.

Player_000_choice_002_fEven if they hate me.
Q
Mirabel_004_f@Me too! But I don't think everyone around here understands them.
Ü
Mirabel_005_fuYou have to be super patient. They get nervous when they sense a stranger nearby. So, you have to watch their stance.
¶
Mirabel_006_fîIf they're on their hind legs, don't move or they'll flee. You can approach when they are sitting, but stop moving if they're about to get up again.

Mirabel_007_f!Oh, and they really like berries!
;
Mirabel_008_f*How do you know so much about raccoons...?
}
Mirabel_009_flMy cousin Antonio loves animals. His gift is that he can understand them, and he taught me what to look for.
¢
Mirabel_010_fêI'll bring the <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> to Scrooge. By now, the raccoon has probably buried it. I'll have to dig around...
F
Mirabel_011_f5They are at first, but I think I've figured them out.
P
Mirabel_012_f?No, they don't hate you! They're just really wary of strangers.
