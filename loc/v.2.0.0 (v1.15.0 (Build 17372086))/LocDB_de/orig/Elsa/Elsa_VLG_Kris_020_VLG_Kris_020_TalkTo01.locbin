Elsa_001_f2Anna's so sad. I have to do something to help her.

Elsa_002_f‡I spoke to Merlin, and he suggested a spell that might help. It's not really my kind of magic, but I know that you're good with spells.

P
Player_001_choice_001_f5I don't want to try anything that might be dangerous.

Elsa_005_f*No problem. What do we need for the spell?
c

Elsa_016_fUWe'll need some water. <ActivityItem>Swamp Water</ActivityItem>, to be more specific.

Elsa_017_f:You should check the <Lore>Glade of Trust</Lore> for that.
