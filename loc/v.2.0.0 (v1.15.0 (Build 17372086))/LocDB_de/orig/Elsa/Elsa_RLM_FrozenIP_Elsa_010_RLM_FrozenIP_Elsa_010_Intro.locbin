Elsa_009_fzHello, {PlayerName}. My sister tells me you helped her get through the forest safely and calm the other Spirits of Nature.
H
Player_004_choice_000_f-Don't mention it. Helping people's what I do!
?
Player_004_choice_001_f$Don't thank me yet. This isn't over.
Z

Elsa_020_fLThat's very kind of you. Do you think you could help me with one last thing?

Elsa_002_f/I've been trying to calm Gale, the Wind Spirit.

Elsa_011_f°It's usually very playful, but when the Water Spirit got upset, Gale was scared. I know Gale trusts me, but it's so agitated I'm not sure it can hear me clearly.

Player_003_fWI have an idea. We should put Wind Chimes in the trees, so this Spirit of Nature can...

Player_003_choice_000_f...create music.
'
Player_003_choice_001_f...have fun.

Player_003_choice_002_f...experiment with the sounds.

Elsa_013_fPI don't know if Gale understands what music is, but it's definitely worth a try.
F

Elsa_010_f8I'll keep trying to calm Gale while you make the chimes.

Elsa_017_f∫I'll need <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> for the structure and tubes, some <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem> for the striker, and I'll need something to hold it together...
ù

Elsa_022_féHere. Take this <ActivityItem>Twine</ActivityItem> I found. Gale was tossing it around earlier. Maybe you can use that to assemble everything.
Z

Elsa_023_fLThanks. I'll be back with the <ActivityItem>Wind Chimes</ActivityItem> soon!

Elsa_014_fYGale loves having fun. And playing pranks. You know, Wind Chimes just might do the trick.
o

Elsa_015_faGale does love new things. It came to see Olaf almost as soon as he entered the Enchanted Forest.

Elsa_021_fYou're right.
