Elsa_006_fXBut once that's all sorted out, I'll let you know that I'm ready to come to the Village.

Elsa_002_fˆHmm... She says your Valley is amazing... Oh, and this photograph? What a strange Ice Cavern. She wants me to come and see it in person.

Elsa_003_fxI do miss her... so much. And things here have been back in balance for a while now. Maybe I could visit your Village...

Elsa_013_fI miss her too.
