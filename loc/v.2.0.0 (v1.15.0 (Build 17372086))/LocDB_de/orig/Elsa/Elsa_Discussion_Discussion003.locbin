Elsa_001_flThe Water Spirit is also called the Water Nokk. It takes the form of a horse and has the power of the ocean.

Elsa_002_feThe Nokk guards the Enchanted Forest fiercely and won't respect you unless you prove yourself worthy.

Elsa_003_feThe Fire Spirit appears as a tiny salamander who leaves a trail of fire as it runs. We call it Bruni.
™

Elsa_004_fŠIts flames can be frightening, but it only makes them in times of unrest or strife. Bruni likes it when I make snowflakes that it can eat.

Elsa_005_f6The Earth Giants can be dangerous if you disturb them.
\

Elsa_009_fNThey sleep most of the time, so you might mistake them for hills or mountains.
`

Elsa_006_fRBut if they wake, they stomp and throw boulders. So... it's best not to wake them.

Elsa_007_fZThe Wind Spirit can be a playful, gentle breeze, or a swirling vortex. Olaf named it Gale.
\

Elsa_008_fNMy mother knew Gale when she was a young girl. Gale helped her save my father.
`

Elsa_010_fRAnd Gale guided us at many points during our journey through the Enchanted Forest.
