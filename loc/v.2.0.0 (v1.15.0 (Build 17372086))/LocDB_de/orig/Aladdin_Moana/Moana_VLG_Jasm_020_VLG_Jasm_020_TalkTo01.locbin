Moana_000_f×Moana! I could use your help with something... Jasmine and I need to make this extremely important key to open a Secret Journal, but we need some <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem> for the crafting recipe.
n
Moana_001_f_<ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem> for a key? Hmm... That actually sparks a memory...
'
Moana_002_fPun definitely intended!
)
Player_000_choice_000_fHah, good one!
B
Player_000_choice_001_f'Funny! But, um, the Sea Sand Sparks...?

Player_000_choice_002_fThere's no time for puns!
:
Moana_003_f+Thanks! Now, about those Sea Sand Sparks...
È
Moana_014_f¸I remember helping with this before the Forgetting. Jasmine was trying to keep the key safe. That <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem> you're talking about is magical, isn't it?
p
Moana_015_faWell, it grew out of an Enchanted Flower in Jasmine's House. So yes, I think it's pretty magical.
ž
Moana_007_fŽThat means you won't need regular Sea Sand Sparks. They'll have to come from a particular sort of <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Torch</ActivityItem>.
I
Moana_008_f:Do you know what kind of torch I need to make that happen?
Ð
Moana_009_fÀActually, I do! Merlin taught me to make a Sea Sand Torch that never goes out. We'll have to make one from scratch and include a gemstone to ensure the Sea Sand Sparks are as bright as can be.
,
Player_001_choice_000_fThat makes sense.

Player_001_choice_001_fWhat does the shine do?
>
Player_001_choice_002_f#I love when things are extra shiny!

Moana_010_fGreat!
¿
Moana_013_f¯When the <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem> shine brightly, that'll bring the magic to the key, and then it'll open that <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem>.
›
Moana_016_f‹Gotcha. If you tell me what we need, I can <Lore>gather all the materials</Lore> so we can make the Sea Sand Torch and gather those sparks.
%
Moana_017_fSure! I'd be happy to.
"
Moana_011_fI'm glad you asked.
a
Moana_012_fRI know a giant monster crab who does too. But this isn't just for looks, you know.

Moana_004_fRight! The Sea Sand Sparks!

Moana_005_fRight. Ahem...
