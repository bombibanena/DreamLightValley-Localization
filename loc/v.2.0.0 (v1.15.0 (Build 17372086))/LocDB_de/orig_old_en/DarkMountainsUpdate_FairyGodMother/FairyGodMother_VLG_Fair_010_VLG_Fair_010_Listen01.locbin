FairyGodMother_000_f8Ah, my dear old friend! How good it is to see you again!
z
FairyGodMother_005_fbWell, I'm here now, dear. And I'm sure the two of us will get to the bottom of this little pickle.
S
FairyGodMother_006_f;Oh, I'm afraid neither of us holds the key to solving this.

FairyGodMother_007_f!What we need is Dreamlight Magic.
Y
FairyGodMother_008_fAGoodness, yes... Of course. So only {PlayerName} can manage it...
j
FairyGodMother_009_fRWell, thank you, Merlin. We'll be off. But you and I must meet for tea again soon.

p
FairyGodMother_012_fXOh yes! I'm afraid this is not a social call, Merlin. {PlayerName} and I are on a quest.
Z
FairyGodMother_002_fBWe're looking for a way to douse the fires in the Forgotten Lands.

FairyGodMother_003_fAn industrious quest indeed!
u
FairyGodMother_013_f]Why, I've tried to solve that problem myself but, heh, I'm afraid it's quite the conundrum...
K
FairyGodMother_004_f3None of my experiments have been successful at all!
