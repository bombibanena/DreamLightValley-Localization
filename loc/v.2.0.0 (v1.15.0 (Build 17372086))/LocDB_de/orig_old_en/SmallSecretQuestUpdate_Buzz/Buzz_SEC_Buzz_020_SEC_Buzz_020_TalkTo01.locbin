Buzz_001_fwSomeone needs to review their handbook again. That's a Code I-5X. And I hope for all our sakes that never happens here.

Buzz_005_f—Code L-5X means we have toys where they shouldn't be. Some of the <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> are <Lore>hiding in the Villagers' houses</Lore>.

Buzz_006_f-Uh-oh. I guess I'll need to check for them...

Buzz_004_fGPrecisely! You've got that handbook practically memorized, haven't you?
