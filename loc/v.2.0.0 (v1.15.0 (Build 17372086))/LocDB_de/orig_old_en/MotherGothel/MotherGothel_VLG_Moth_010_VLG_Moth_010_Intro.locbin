MotherGothel_000_foOh, good. The Valley's gofer's here. Tell me you have time to obtain an artifact for me. I'm in desperate need.
,
Player_000_choice_003_fWhat do you need?
F
Player_000_choice_004_f+Well this gofer has something else to do...
Œ
MotherGothel_011_f∑That merchant with the feathers... Stooge, is it? He has a magical scroll. The <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem>. It doesn't lead to riches, so it's completely useless to him.
•
MotherGothel_006_féIt does lead to the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>, though. A magical artifact that will help us restore the Giant Willow in the Glade.
ù
MotherGothel_021_fÜPlus there's an insignificant little side effect that keeps me forever young... But the important thing is that everyone will benefit.
ë
MotherGothel_012_f{I doubt the merchant even knows what the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem> does. So, be a dear and fetch it for me.

MotherGothel_013_f(Has Mr. McDuck agreed to give it to you?
J
MotherGothel_014_f4Not in so many words. But that can be quickly fixed.
õ
MotherGothel_027_fÑWe'll simply spy on him, learn where he hid the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem>, and then take it for my... our... selves.

Player_000_choice_005_fSpying is fun. Let's do this.
F
Player_000_choice_006_f+I think I'll just talk to Scrooge directly.
Õ
MotherGothel_010_f∂Oh, aren't you scrumptious! Now, go to the food seller ‚Äî you know, the one in that ridiculous green hat ‚Äî and warn him someone will steal the <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem>.

MotherGothel_017_fiHe'll believe you and want to help. He'll run to tell the merchant, and I'll be hidden nearby, listening.
?
MotherGothel_016_f)It should be simple enough, even for you.

MotherGothel_029_fLet's use a recording device...
+
Player_000_choice_007_fIt'll be easier.
F
Player_000_choice_008_f+That way, you'll hear everything perfectly.
P
Player_000_choice_009_f5Better than seeing you in a fedora and trench coat...
X
MotherGothel_008_fBChildren these days, always relying on gadgets to do their chores.
q
MotherGothel_004_f[Lackeys are far more reliable. But fine, {PlayerName}. If you insist, we'll do it your way.
@
MotherGothel_003_f*Now, what exactly is a "recording device"?
´
MotherGothel_028_fîIt's a machine that will let us listen in on conversations. We'll hide it in a plant. We can call it a <ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem>...
2
Player_001_choice_003_fNobody will suspect it.
6
Player_001_choice_004_fWe'll just remove it later.
U
Player_001_choice_005_f:That'll teach Scrooge McDuck not to make me work for free.
a
MotherGothel_007_fKWell, it's not like any of these fools have brains enough to be suspicious.
y
MotherGothel_019_fcI'm going to need <ActivityItem>Soil</ActivityItem> and some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>.
r
MotherGothel_022_f\And I'll need to find some <ActivityItem>Electronic Components</ActivityItem> for the mic...
Z
MotherGothel_020_fDHmm... you might find something in that annoying living box's House.
F
MotherGothel_025_f0You know, the one with the obsession for refuse.
¶
MotherGothel_023_fèWhat are you waiting for? Off you go! Make this "<ActivityItem>Micberry Tree</ActivityItem>" of yours and place it in front of Scrooge's Store.
d
MotherGothel_015_fNCovering your tracks? We might just make something of you yet, {PlayerName}...
ö
MotherGothel_018_fÉAs I told you, the whole Village will benefit from the discovery of the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>. Including you, dear.
T
MotherGothel_009_f>That Goofy does have a tendency to mumble. A dreadful habit...
@
MotherGothel_026_f*Now, what exactly is a "recording device"?
F
MotherGothel_005_f0I have no idea what you're saying, {PlayerName}.
R
MotherGothel_001_f<Ugh! I should have known you couldn't do such a simple task.
[
MotherGothel_030_fEFine. Run along then. Maybe Scrooge McDuck will make a deal with you.
w
MotherGothel_002_faAs long as you bring me back the <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem>, I don't care how you do it.
É
MotherGothel_024_fmWhat else could someone as dull as you be doing? I'm just teasing, dear. Don't be so serious. Come back soon!
