MotherGothel_000_fxAh, {PlayerName}... It's occurred to me that only you and I have the interests of this Valley at heart; don't you agree?

Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I do.

Player_000_choice_001_fWhat makes you think that?
R
Player_000_choice_002_f7I think everyone cares for the Valley in their own way.

MotherGothel_001_f#Finally, someone who listens to me!

MotherGothel_004_f™They're all living in their grand Houses, only caring for themselves and their personal whims. Unlike me. Why, I've truly dedicated myself to tending to the Giant Willow.
3
Player_001_choice_000_fI love the Giant Willow!
4
Player_001_choice_001_fWhy do you look after it?
;
Player_001_choice_002_f You can always stop, you know...
k
MotherGothel_006_fUThen maybe YOU ought to live in it! Ha-ha! Only kidding, dear. Don't look so serious.
r
MotherGothel_009_f\After all, I was the one who helped you grow that Giant Willow in the first place, you know.
b
MotherGothel_010_fLAnd that is proof that only you and I care about what's best for our Valley.
è
MotherGothel_007_fyBecause someone needs to! Plants are like children. They require constant care if you don't want them to grow up spoiled.
ç
MotherGothel_011_fwI was the one who helped you make sure the tree would grow strong and tall. So... of course, I stayed to watch over it.
Ñ
MotherGothel_008_fnThen there would be no one to care for the willow I helped you grow. No, {PlayerName}. I must stay where I am.

MotherGothel_002_fWell, just look around...
n
MotherGothel_003_fXPerhaps, but how many of them have proof to support their claims? Few or none, I'm sure.
