Scrooge_000_f(Ah, {PlayerName}, what can I do for you?
T
Scrooge_002_fCI'm helping Sulley bring back something called Monster Movie Night.
D
Scrooge_003_f3He was wondering where your rental videotapes went.
F
Scrooge_004_f5Hmm... I did see him lookin' around the shop earlier.
F
Player_000_choice_000_f+Well, now you know what he was looking for!

Player_000_choice_001_fWhy didn't you talk to him?
N
Player_000_choice_002_f3I'm surprised you didn't urge him to buy something.
+
Scrooge_005_fWhy didn't he just ask me?
e
Scrooge_016_fTI guess I'll have to ask each of them until I find who has it... Thanks, Mr. McDuck!

Scrooge_009_f!Sulley didn't want to bother you.
X
Scrooge_010_fGNonsense. I'm always here for my customers. Especially the paying ones!
R
Scrooge_011_fAAs for the tapes, I'm afraid I cannae offer that service anymore.

Scrooge_012_f	How come?
Å
Scrooge_013_fpBecause I was always havin' to chase the Villagers down to get 'em back! Eventually, I decided to cut my losses.
“
Scrooge_014_f¿I suspect some Villagers still have tapes from before the Forgetting. And, if I remember correctly, one of 'em would be perfect for Monster Movie Night. "20,000 Giant Arachnids Under the Bed."
_
Scrooge_015_fNI don't remember exactly who has it, but it's either Ursula, Mickey, or Goofy.
w
Scrooge_001_ffHmm... Though I do recall that whoever rented it did it for a special occasion with a special someone.
n
Scrooge_006_f]Well, I had another customer, and some Villagers don't like to be pestered while they browse.
ê
Scrooge_007_fWell, I had another customer. And they were contemplatin' a rather LARGE purchase, so I had to give 'em my undivided attention.

Scrooge_008_f)Why didn't Sulley ask me about the tapes?
