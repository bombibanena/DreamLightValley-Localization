H
Ursula_006_f8You don't have a <ActivityItem>Videotape</ActivityItem>?
i
Ursula_007_fYOh, I do. But it's not anything that hirsute do-gooder and his one-eyed friend will want.

Ursula_017_fèOh, I learned all about this "movie" nonsense during my previous time here in the Valley. Some Villagers are very fond of such a silly pastime.

Ursula_018_fÇI didn't think much of it until I realized it could provide marvelous insights into the desires and needs of you surface dwellers.
