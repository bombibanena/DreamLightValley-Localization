Merlin_000_fW{PlayerName}... I need to speak to you about a... a SCOURGE that's facing this Village!
@
Merlin_001_f0Why it's nearly gotten as bad as the Forgetting.
V
Merlin_002_fFI'm talking about bad manners! Vanellope was quite rude to me earlier.
G
Player_000_choice_000_f,Vanellope is just trying to express herself.
B
Player_000_choice_001_f'Come on. I thought it was pretty funny.
F
Player_000_choice_002_f+*sigh* I'll make sure she leaves you alone.

Merlin_003_f"Express herself? Express herself?!
f
Merlin_004_fVKindly tell her that next time she would like to "express herself" in such a manner...
Q
Merlin_005_fA...she ought to do it in a direction that is not towards my face!
d
Merlin_006_fTUgh, this is hopeless. I fear the entire Valley will soon lapse into utter rudeness.
Ÿ
Merlin_007_fŽIt almost makes one miss the Forgetting. At least that gave me some peace and quiet to read my books, even if I couldn't remember what I read.

Merlin_008_fThank you, {PlayerName}.
g
Merlin_009_fWYou're the one thing standing between this Valley and a complete lapse into incivility!
