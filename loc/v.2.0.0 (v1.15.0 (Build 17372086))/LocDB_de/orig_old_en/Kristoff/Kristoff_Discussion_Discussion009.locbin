Kristoff_006_f!It is. It's always worked for me.

Kristoff_007_fIYeah. The forest and Troll Valley. Guess that's why I feel at home there.

Kristoff_008_fäI promise I won't. Don't want to lose touch with everyone I care about. And besides, there aren't a lot of carrots in the forest for Sven.

Kristoff_003_f;Thanks... I guess everyone's weird in their own way, right?
