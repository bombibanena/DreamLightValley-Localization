Kristoff_016_f(Hey, {PlayerName}, do you have a minute?
*
Player_000_choice_000_fYes, of course.
)
Player_000_choice_001_fNot right now.
£
Kristoff_000_fêThanks! I could use some advice. I went foraging earlier, and I have all these extra materials... Some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Sand</ActivityItem>, and good carving <ActivityItem>Stone</ActivityItem>. What do you think I should do with it all?
^
Kristoff_008_fLYou could almost start a <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem> with all this...
W
Player_000_choice_011_f<Wait! You SHOULD start a <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>!
J
Player_000_choice_012_f/Would that be something you'd be interested in?
@
Player_000_choice_003_f%But only if you call it THE KRISTORE.
W
Kristoff_001_fEI guess I do have experience selling things. Ice. I used to sell ice.
ö
Kristoff_004_fáBut harvesting and selling ice seems pretty different from taking care of a <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>. I'd need some guidance.
m
Kristoff_011_f[I could ask Goofy for advice on how to build your own <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>...
5
Player_001_choice_000_fHe's always happy to help.
2
Player_001_choice_001_fYou could come with me.
3
Player_001_choice_002_fStay here. I'll ask him.
~
Kristoff_006_flFunny you mention Goofy. The other day, we were fishing next to each other. Everything was calm, relaxing...
Ä
Kristoff_009_fnNext thing I know he sneezes, manages to hit me in the head with his fishing rod, and pushes me into the pond.
g
Kristoff_010_fUDefinitely not who I'd go to for fishing advice. But he does run a pretty good Stall.
c
Kristoff_005_fQI'd be happy to ask him for you... Just to avoid any potential new head injuries.

Kristoff_007_fThanks.

Kristoff_002_fI might be...
7
Kristoff_003_f%Yeah, that's not gonna happen. But...
6
Kristoff_017_f$Okay. Some other time, then. See ya!
