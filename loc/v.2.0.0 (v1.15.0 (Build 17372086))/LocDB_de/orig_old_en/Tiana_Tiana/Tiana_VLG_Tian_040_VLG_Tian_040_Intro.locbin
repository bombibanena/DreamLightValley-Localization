H
Tiana_002_f9Just a little something I've been working on for a while.

Tiana_005_f2We're going to have ourselves a Mardi Gras parade!

Player_002_choice_000_fA what?

Player_002_choice_001_f	So. COOL.

Tiana_006_faA Mardi Gras parade! In New Orleans, we celebrate a special holiday called Mardi Gras every year.

Tiana_014_f
On my way!
ç
Tiana_007_f~And one of the best parts of Mardi Gras is dressing up in special costumes and watching a parade or, better yet, being in one.
°
Tiana_008_fëSo I want to do the Dreamlight Valley version. That way I can share some of my hometown traditions and let folks bring their own spark to it too.
"
Tiana_009_fThat sounds so fun!
_
Tiana_010_fPNow usually, a parade has lots of floats, but I'm not sure that would work here.

Tiana_011_fôSo instead... I thought Daisy could help us by making a fancy <ActivityItem>Parade Float Mask</ActivityItem> for you to wear. Since you'll be the leader.
B
Tiana_012_f3Great idea! ... I'll do my best as a parade leader.
ú
Tiana_013_fåI know you will! Why don't you <Lore>go see Daisy and talk fashion</Lore>? I'm sure she'll have some swell ideas for what else you can wear.

Tiana_001_fHWhile you do that, I have some secret items of my own to get together...
