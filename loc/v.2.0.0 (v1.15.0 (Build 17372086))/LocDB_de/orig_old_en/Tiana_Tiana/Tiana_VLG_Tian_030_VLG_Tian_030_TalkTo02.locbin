Tiana_001_f Wonderful! Chef Remy's here too.

Tiana_016_fCool! Hey, Remy!
z
Tiana_002_fkI'm just here to help out and maybe get some tips on Cajun cooking. But Kristoff, Anna, and Mike are ready!
F
Tiana_004_f7I can see that! You've got herbs, a bunch of veggies...
A
Tiana_005_f2What's the first round of the contest going to be?
ƒ
Tiana_006_ftWell, we're going to start with some basic skills â€” washing herbs and the difference between chopping and mincing.
2
Tiana_007_f#Cool! Well, I'll leave you to itâ€”
I
Tiana_008_f:Hold up, {PlayerName}; we need a hand with something else.
Z
Tiana_025_fKWe thought it might help if you did the demonstrations for our contestants.
Y
Tiana_026_fJThat way Remy and I can be by their sides guiding them as they try things.

Tiana_010_f$Me? But I'm not a professional chef.
U

Tiana_012_f
I guess...
(
Tiana_013_fMarvelous! Let's begin...
”
Tiana_015_f„To start, could you <Lore>demonstrate handling herbs by washing them</Lore>? That way they'll see how clean we want the herbs to be.
¿
Tiana_022_f¯Then, <Lore>chop the corn and potatoes into bite-sized pieces</Lore>. That'll show our contestants how to get everything the same size and the right size so it cooks properly.
)
Tiana_023_fSure! What are you making?
_
Tiana_024_fPIt's a <ActivityItem>Seafood Boil</ActivityItem> â€” a classic New Orleans dish.
Å
Tiana_019_fµSo we'll need some extra fresh seafood too. Would you catch us some <ActivityItem>Shrimp</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Crab</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Lobster</ActivityItem>?
p
Tiana_020_faWhen all the Ingredients are ready, please bring them to me and I'll take care of the next steps.
