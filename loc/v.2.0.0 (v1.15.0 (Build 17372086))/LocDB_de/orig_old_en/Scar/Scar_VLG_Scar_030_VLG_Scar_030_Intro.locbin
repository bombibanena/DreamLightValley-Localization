Scar_008_fXWell then, not long ago, you removed some of the wildebeest bones littering the Plateau.


Scar_009_fBut you only managed to get rid of the smallest of them, which was of very little help. Now, I've come up with the key to removing ALL of them.

Scar_012_f>My nap times are far too precious for such constant vigilance.
z

Scar_006_flWell, you know where your answers lie now, {PlayerName}. Do what you decide is best in your INFINITE wisdom.
L

Scar_002_f>Oh, of course. I'm sure you have far, far better things to do.
