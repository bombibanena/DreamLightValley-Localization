Scar_000_fuA pile of <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem>, {PlayerName}? Don't tell me she's trying to frighten me with these?
ú

Scar_001_fçMother Gothel says I need to turn these to <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> and then... she said a bunch of stuff about the Circle of Life.
U

Scar_002_fGShe also said that you tried to turn her into a three-course meal once.
:

Scar_015_f,Oh, THAT again? Bah! I wasn't hunting her...
c

Scar_009_fUI was merely patrolling the Sunlit Plateau to ensure the safety of the whole Village.
)
Player_000_choice_000_fI believe you.
>
Player_000_choice_001_f#Come on, Scar. I'm not buying this.
E

Scar_004_f7Oh, goody. Then you'll believe what I have to say next.
/

Scar_028_f!Yes, well, I may have a solution.
á

Scar_029_fyThere's a <Lore>Volcanic Geyser</Lore> inside my cave. Put the bones in there. The heat and pressure should do the trick.
m

Scar_003_f_Then I suppose you'll just have to gather the <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> and bury them.
/

Scar_008_f!That's all? Sounds pretty simple.
c

Scar_031_fUDon't forget to water the <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem>, or it will never grow.
£

Scar_016_fîI saw her burying something in the ground before scurrying away. Naturally, I was worried for the safety of the Village so I decided to investigate.
ì

Scar_017_fÑA mysterious <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem> grew where I'd seen her digging. It wasn't long before she came back, so I pounced!

Scar_018_f*She was planting a flower? That's strange.
|

Scar_006_fnYes, and she was looking through some item she'd pilfered from that windbag with the pointy blue head feather.
•

Scar_025_fñShe buried the <ActivityItem>Ashes</ActivityItem> from <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem>... and a <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem> grew there.
•

Scar_026_fñThis is what she meant by the Circle of Life! The <ActivityItem>Old Bones</ActivityItem> grew into a <ActivityItem>Flower</ActivityItem>... literally.
W

Scar_027_fIOh dear. You're starting to babble like my brother's unhinged mandrill...
L

Scar_007_f>We've only got one problem. How do we turn these bones to ash?

Scar_005_fBut it's the truth. I swear.
