Scar_000_f<Oh, {PlayerName}, it's you. *yawn* ... What do you want now?
›

Scar_011_fŒSimba wants to remember more about his past in the Valley. You were mostly protected from the Forgetting in your cave. What do you remember?
f

Scar_003_fXOh, so much. So much, in fact, that Simba will probably wish I didn't. Now, let's see...
Û

Scar_006_fÌOh, yes. Before the Forgetting, you put Simba in charge of protecting the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>. It was a haven for all the scrumptious... er... fragile creatures around the Valley.
j

Scar_007_f\But then, the Night Thorns came. And instead of staying and doing what he was supposed to...
V

Scar_001_fH...Simba ran away, back to Pride Rock. And the Dreamlight Tree withered.
;
Player_000_choice_000_f There must be a way to fix this.
9
Player_000_choice_001_fSo there's nothing to be done?
F
Player_000_choice_002_f+And you just stood there and let it wither?


Scar_002_f
Perhaps...
f

Scar_005_fXOnly you can fix my nephew's mistake... Oh, but that's right. You don't remember either.
«

Scar_017_fœYou don't remember the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seeds</ActivityItem> that sprout into more trees. Of course, you stopped anyone from ever finding them.
>

Scar_010_f0It's like you don't trust anyone... not even me.
«

Scar_013_fœDon't trust anyone...? These <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seeds</ActivityItem> must be something special if I felt like I had to hide them. Where are they?
“

Scar_014_f„In the Mines below the Sunlit Plateau. You hid them in a very secret room. Let's hope, for everyone's sake, you manage to find them.
…

Scar_016_fwWell, there are more <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seeds</ActivityItem>. But you stopped anyone from ever finding them.
L

Scar_004_f>Well, I would have done something, but YOU ensured I couldn't.
