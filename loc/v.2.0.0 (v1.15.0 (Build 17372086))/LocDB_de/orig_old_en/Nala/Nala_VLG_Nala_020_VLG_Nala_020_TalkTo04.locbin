Nala_004_f)Ugh. What is that? And why is it glowing?
A
Player_000_f1It's some kind of fish that swam out of the rift.

Player_000_choice_000_fI hope it's not dangerous.

Player_000_choice_001_f$It might be the key to solving this.

Player_000_choice_002_f$I'll bet it doesn't taste very good.

Nala_000_f>I've never seen anything like it. Or SMELLED anything like it.

Nala_006_fBAll of this... the rifts, the glowing fish, the strange statues...

Nala_010_f[Ursula seems to only care about what's best for Ursula. Do you really think she'll help us?

Nala_005_f)You even manage to get along with Scar...

Nala_014_fNWell, I suppose you should lead the way. Let's <Lore>go talk to Ursula</Lore>.
A

Nala_012_f3That's true. It is in her best interest to help us.

Nala_003_fOEven Scar wouldn't want the whole Valley to get pulled into one of those rifts.


Nala_013_fqYou really are a leader, {PlayerName}. You seem to know how to keep even the worst creatures around here in line.

Nala_015_f%Not even Scar wants to mess with you.
