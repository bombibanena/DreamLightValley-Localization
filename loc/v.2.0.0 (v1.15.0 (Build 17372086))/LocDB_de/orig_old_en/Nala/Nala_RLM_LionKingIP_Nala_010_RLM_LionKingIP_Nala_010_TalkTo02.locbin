Nala_001_fI can't believe that worked.

Nala_002_fBThe thorns are too dense for the hyenas to get through. We did it!
M

Nala_000_f?Whoa. You just held off a whole pack of hyenas all on your own!

Player_002_choice_001_fNow it's time to find Simba.

Player_002_choice_002_f$They must be pretty pathetic hyenas.

Nala_021_f0Thanks. But I couldn't have done it without you.
,

Nala_024_fNow, it's my turn to help you.

Nala_008_f'You should stick close to me for a bit.
B

Nala_007_f4Even without the hyenas, the jungle has its dangers.
‰

Nala_009_f{I don't know where you fall on the food chain, but your teeth and claws aren't very sharp, and you look kind of... squishy.
I

Nala_010_f;You've hardly got any fur. Is that normal for your species?

Player_001_choice_000_fYep. I'm a human.

Nala_011_fxA "human"... huh? I've never seen any of you around the water hole. Well... welcome. And like I said, stick close to me.
P

Nala_012_fBA lot of things in this jungle might want to turn you into a meal.

Nala_018_fGood to know. I'll watch out.



Nala_013_fOkay.
e

Nala_014_fWBut there are lots of creatures in this jungle that might want to turn you into a meal.


Nala_015_fSo stick close.
n

Nala_016_f`Really? Like Timon? Wow. I didn't know meerkats could grow so big. Well, just stick close to me.
n

Nala_017_f`A lot of things in this jungle would probably love to turn a giant hairless meerkat into a meal.
?

Nala_022_f1Right. We'll have to head deeper into the jungle.
q

Nala_023_fcJust one of them isn't so tough. But when they come at you in big numbers... you have to watch out.

Nala_025_f*And speaking of watching out for things...
