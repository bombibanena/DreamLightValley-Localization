Nala_006_fêSo, I found what you were talking about. It's a statue. The weird thing is that the second I picked it up, I saw something shining in the water.
}

Nala_000_foIt looked like some kind of <Lore>mystical rift</Lore>. Here. I took a picture of it to give you a closer look.
e

Nala_001_fWThat's so strange. Every time I look towards Dazzle Beach, my whiskers start twitching.
{

Nala_007_fmUgh, and that smell! I know my nose is more sensitive than yours, but it's worse than a whole pack of hyenas.
P

Nala_009_fBThe statue, the rift, the smell... they must be connected somehow.

Nala_010_f)Maybe if we just bury the statue again...
R

Nala_019_fDI'll patrol and make sure nothing dangerous comes through that rift.

Nala_012_f#I don't think that's going to help.
{

Nala_013_fmThe smell isn't just coming from Dazzle Beach anymore. Now I smell it coming from other places in the Valley.


Nala_014_fUh-oh. Where?

Nala_015_f+The Frosted Heights and the Glade of Trust.
N

Nala_016_f@If I even look in those directions, my whiskers start twitching.
ã

Nala_017_f}I'll go <Lore>investigate the Frosted Heights and the Glade of Trust</Lore> to see if any more mystical rifts have opened up.
C

Nala_020_f5Maybe there are more of these statues lying around...

Nala_018_f)Please hurry. The smell is getting worse.

Nala_011_f?I'm not sure. I've never encountered anything like this before.
