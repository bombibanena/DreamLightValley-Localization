Nala_006_fQThere are a lot more of those odd fish appearing in all the waters of the Valley.

Nala_008_f-It's getting so we can't catch anything else.

Nala_009_fXBut if anyone tries to cook them, they just disappear. We can't let the pride go hungry.

Player_001_choice_000_f+Don't worry. I'll catch some fish for them.
F
Player_001_choice_001_f+I just hope I can catch something else too.
