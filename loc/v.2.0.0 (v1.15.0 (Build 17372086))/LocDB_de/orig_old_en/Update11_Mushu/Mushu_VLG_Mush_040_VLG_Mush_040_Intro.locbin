Player_000_choice_000_fWhat did he do now?
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$I'm a little busy. Let's talk later.

Mushu_002_f"I see his reputation precedes him.
M
Mushu_003_f>Well, that big bully has been on some kinda power trip lately.
¤
Mushu_007_f”He's walking around like he owns the place! Strutting and snapping his teeth at Villagers less than half his size. I'm telling you: I don't like it!

Mushu_008_f"Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.
k
Mushu_004_f\C'mon! We're Guardians here! We gotta investigate and put a stop to any nefarious goings-on.
¤
Mushu_005_f”I'm gonna go keep an eye on Scar â€” do a little recon. Can you talk to <Lore>Woody, Buzz, Stitch, and Remy</Lore>? See if he's been bothering them?

Mushu_006_fI'm on the case!
F
Mushu_009_f7Well, that is no excuse to treat other Villagers badly.

Mushu_001_fOAll right. But don't be long! I got a metaphorical bone to pick with that lion.
