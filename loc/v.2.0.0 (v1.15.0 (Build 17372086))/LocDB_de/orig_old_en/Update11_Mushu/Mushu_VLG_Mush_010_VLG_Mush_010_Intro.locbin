Mushu_001_fZHey, {PlayerName}. I need a little help here. It's about the Forgetting. You got a minute?
6
Player_000_choice_000_fWhat's on your mind, Mushu?
,
Player_000_choice_001_fLet's talk later.
k
Mushu_017_f\Well, I'm real happy to be here in the Valley. And everything's starting to come back to me.
Ñ
Mushu_018_fuLike, I remembered that before the Forgetting, I wasn't JUST Mulan's Guardian... I was Guardian for the whole Valley.
V
Mushu_019_fGProblem is, now that I've remembered, I got this worry I can't shake...
:
Mushu_020_f+What happens if I forget everything again?!
8
Player_003_choice_000_fYour friends will remind you!
A
Player_003_choice_001_f&Dreamlight Valley is safe with me now.
L
Player_003_choice_002_f1Would a song help you make sure you don't forget?
,
Mushu_022_fUnless THEY forget again too!
g
Mushu_024_fXHmm... Maybe we can put up a display? Something that will always remind you who you are.
I
Player_004_choice_000_f.Like a big shield, because you're a protector?
9
Player_004_choice_001_fLike a big, everlasting torch?
5
Player_004_choice_002_fLike a HUGE statue of YOU?
ã
Mushu_026_f|I might not get the message with that. See, there was this time I used a shield as a snow sled‚Äî But, that's not the point.
ö
Mushu_028_fäThat does give me an idea, though. What if we made something like the <Lore>Great Stone Dragon</Lore> statue from the Fa family's garden?!
™
Mushu_029_föIt's a HUGE Guardian statue that always inspired me to be a Guardian. Here, it could remind me that I AM a Guardian. Like a giant symbol of my sworn duty!
'
Player_002_choice_000_fLet's do it!
5
Player_002_choice_001_fThat's surprisingly sweet.
4
Player_002_choice_002_fIt won't bruise your ego?
/
Mushu_011_f Aw, I knew I could count on you!
V
Mushu_013_fGFirst, we gotta get rid of any bad luck that might mess up the project.
ù
Mushu_015_fçSince my pal Cri-Kee isn't here, could you <Lore>go back to our training camp</Lore> and catch a few <ActivityItem>Lucky Bugs</ActivityItem>?
?
Mushu_016_f0While you do that, I'm gonna draw up some plans.
R
Mushu_010_fCWell, you know, even a fearsome dragon can have a soft side. Now...
M
Mushu_012_f>Please! I'm the Guardian of an ENTIRE VALLEY! I'm good. Now...
;
Mushu_025_f,A hot idea! But probably a little too vague.
π
Mushu_027_f©Heh-heh. Now, I do like the sound of that, but I'm not sure it'll help me remember my duty to the Valley. Of course it WOULD make me say, "Whoa! What a handsome statue!"
m
Mushu_021_f^I know, I know. And you're great, {PlayerName}. But I gotta make sure I can always do my part.
O
Mushu_023_f@Ha! I like the way you think, but singing isn't really my thing.
;
Mushu_003_f,Okay. All right. No problem. I'll be around!
