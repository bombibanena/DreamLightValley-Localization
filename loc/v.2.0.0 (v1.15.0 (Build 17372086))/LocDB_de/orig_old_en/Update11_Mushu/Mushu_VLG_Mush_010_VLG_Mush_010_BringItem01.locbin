Mushu_001_f<Hey now, these are some of the luckiest bugs I've ever seen!
h
Mushu_002_fYI'll take good care of 'em while we build the statue, and let 'em go once we're finished.

Player_000_choice_000_fWhat's next, Mushu?

Player_000_choice_001_fI'm feeling luckier already!
8
Player_000_choice_002_fAw, like they're little pets!
^
Mushu_004_fOWe gotta <Lore>scout the Valley for the PERFECT place to put our statue.</Lore>
Ê
Mushu_011_fºLet's both go look. And while you're at it, take this <ActivityItem>Incense Lantern</ActivityItem>. Carry it with you to spread good vibes and help you focus on finding the perfect spot.
;
Mushu_000_f,It'll also make the Valley smell extra good!
¢
Mushu_012_f’Oh, but I'd <Lore>avoid doing that magic, sparkly gliding thing you do</Lore>. The breeze blows out the lantern, so you gotta do this one on foot.
P
Mushu_003_fAMe too, and we're gonna need it because now the real work begins.
H
Mushu_005_f9Yeah, maybe I'll even name 'em... Crawly, Skittery and...
t
Mushu_006_fe...Flutter! Aw, they're so cute. Hey, you all! ... What's that...? They say they can't wait to start.

Mushu_007_fJListen to the bugs, {PlayerName}! Let's get our plan for the statue going!
