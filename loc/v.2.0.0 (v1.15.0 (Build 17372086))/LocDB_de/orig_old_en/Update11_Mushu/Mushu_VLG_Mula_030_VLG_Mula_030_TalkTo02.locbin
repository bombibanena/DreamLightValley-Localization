Mushu_000_fAHey, Mushu. Mulan's having trouble finding hobbies in the Valley.
r
Mushu_001_fcWell, I'm glad she went to you for help. But I'm less glad it's not working. Tell me what happened.

Player_000_choice_000_fWe picked flowers and...
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$...we made a vegetable garden and...
G
Player_000_choice_002_f,...everything we tried turned into strategy.
K
Mushu_003_f<She wanted to turn them into some sort of... camouflage mat?
'
Mushu_004_fOoh, that's so CREATIVE!
Z
Mushu_005_fKAnd not the point of fun! She works so HARD, she needs to relax. Let loose!
E
Mushu_002_f6She was talking about preserving them to make rations.
/
Mushu_007_f Or making targets with pumpkins?
M
Mushu_008_f>I hear you. All focus. That girl sure is DEDICATED, isn't she?
1
Mushu_006_f"Hmm... Let me ask you something...
K
Mushu_009_f<When Mulan was doing this stuff, what kinda mood was she in?
P
Player_001_choice_000_f5Happy! Until she realized she was strategizing again.
F
Player_001_choice_001_f+Kind of upset; she kept chasing challenges.
*
Player_001_choice_002_fI have no idea.
K
Mushu_011_f<Okay... Having fun till you realize you're not having "fun."
@
Mushu_013_f1{PlayerName}, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
@
Player_002_choice_000_f%Mulan's fun IS training and strategy!
>
Player_002_choice_001_f#... Probably. But YOU say it first.
-
Player_002_choice_002_fBao are delicious?
+
Mushu_014_fHa, I KNEW we thought alike!
]
Mushu_015_fNMulan has FUN making these plans and strategies and camo-target-ration-majigs.
B
Mushu_017_f3She LOVES challenges. It's how she blows off steam!
ê
Mushu_018_fÄThat... actually makes sense. How do we make sure she can train and strategize in a place where there's no one to train AGAINST?
π
Mushu_019_f©I've got an idea. Let's start by building a couple <ActivityItem>Wooden Training Dummies</ActivityItem>. By the time you're done with that, I'll have it all planned out!
`
Mushu_016_fQOkay, I definitely wasn't thinking THAT. But if you need a snack break, go ahead.
N
Mushu_010_f?But she kept coming back to making challenges for herself? Huh.
X
Mushu_012_fII bet she was happy 'til she realized she was back in her same old habit.
