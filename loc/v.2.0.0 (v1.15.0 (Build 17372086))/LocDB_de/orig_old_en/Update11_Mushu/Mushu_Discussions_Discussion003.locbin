Mushu_001_f1That's easy. I protect the Fa family from danger!

Mushu_002_f7Guide 'em in big life choices, protect 'em from harm...

Mushu_003_fYou know, Guardian stuff.
U
Mushu_004_fFYep. The Fa family. Mulan's family. Families have their own Guardians.

Mushu_005_fPTechnically, I serve the ancestors. They tell me what to do, and I go and do it.
P
Mushu_006_fAYeah. In the Fa family, we got an ox, a monkey, and a few others.

Mushu_007_fzThe monkey and me are pretty good friends. She's not all "I-am-a-Guardian-I-must-be-serious-at-all-times" like the others.

Mushu_008_fOUh, don't ask about the Great Stone Dragon, though. He's on a leave of absence.
