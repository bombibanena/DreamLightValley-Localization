Belle_000_f	Hi Belle!
E
Belle_001_f6Are these books for me, {PlayerName}? How kind of you.
L
Belle_002_f=Oh, thank the Beast, not me ‚Äî I'm just the delivery person.
}
Belle_003_fnWell, thank you for helping get them to me. I know he's not comfortable speaking with the other Villagers yet.

Player_000_choice_000_fYeah, what's up with that?!
(
Player_000_choice_001_fPoor Beast...
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&I don't know what to do with him next!
G
Belle_004_f8He's a bit shy. Though, I don't think he'd admit that...
M
Belle_013_f>That's a wonderful idea! WALL¬∑E enjoys gardening, doesn't he?
H
Belle_014_f9Perhaps he and the Beast could work together with plants.
à
Belle_015_fyWALL¬∑E it is then! And let's see... What about Mirabel? She's helped us out already; I bet she'd be happy to help again!
w
Belle_016_fhShe's used to managing the personalities of her whole family. The Beast's gruffness wouldn't bother her.
K
Belle_017_f<This is so kind of you to do, {PlayerName}. I wish you luck!

Belle_005_fWhat do you think he needs?
M
Belle_006_f>Well, he could use a friend. Someone with a quiet disposition.
Å
Belle_007_frHe's spent so long in a castle with only his servants for company. I think he's forgotten how to make new friends.
:
Belle_008_f+Hmm... but who to try and introduce him to?
B
Belle_009_f3Well... it would have to be someone who's friendly.
1
Belle_010_f"And who would be patient with him.

Belle_011_fLet me think...
L
Belle_012_f=What about WALL¬∑E? He's the friendliest robot I've ever met!
I
Belle_018_f:He's just rather shy. That makes things difficult for him.
X
Belle_019_fII understand. When he gets uncomfortable, he can be difficult to talk to.
