A
Belle_002_f2Yes. It cuts logs into firewood and runs on steam!
Z
Belle_003_fKHe was going to enter it in a fair, but I'm afraid he didn't make it there.
E
Belle_004_f6But hopefully next year. He's sure to win first prize!

Belle_005_fQYes. It has the sun, the Earth, and the planets we can see through our telescope.

Belle_006_f[He hung them on metal wire and created a mechanism so they'll rotate when he turns a crank!
C

H
Belle_008_f9Yes. Though he did break most of our dishes testing it...
