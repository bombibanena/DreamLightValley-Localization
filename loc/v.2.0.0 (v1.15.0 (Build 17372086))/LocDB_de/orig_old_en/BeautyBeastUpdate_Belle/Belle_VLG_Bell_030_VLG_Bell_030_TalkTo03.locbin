Belle_002_fÙAfter I'd helped my friends solve a few puzzles, Minnie announced to everyone that I was the Best Mystery Solver in the Valley. And she gave me a journal with that written on it so I could make notes on my adventures.

Belle_005_f.I wonder what happened to all of that stuff...

Belle_006_fVYou're right. It's not there anymore... Oh, I'd love to create a spot like that again.
