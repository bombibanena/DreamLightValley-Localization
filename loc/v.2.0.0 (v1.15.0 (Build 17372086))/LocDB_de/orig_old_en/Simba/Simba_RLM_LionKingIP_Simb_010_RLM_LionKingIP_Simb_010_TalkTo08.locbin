Simba_000_fWow! It looks better already.

Simba_001_fNAnd this is just the start. Once the animals come back, it'll look even nicer.

Player_000_choice_000_f This will help the whole jungle.

Player_000_choice_001_fYour dad would be proud.

Player_000_choice_002_f3Let's get out of here before a rhinoceros shows up.

Simba_002_f_Yeah. I guess that's what my father meant about leaving the kingdom better than when I started.

Simba_004_fpThanks, {PlayerName}. I feel like my father's looking down on us right now. Maybe I can be a king worthy of him.
b
Simba_006_fSI didn't know him, but I bet you're right... Hey, since we've helped the kingdom...
r
Simba_007_fc...why don't you come with me to meet Nala? She's waiting for you in MY kingdom, Dreamlight Valley.
T
Player_001_choice_000_f9I could use someone there to teach me to be a good ruler.

Player_001_choice_001_f#We need your "roaring" personality.

Player_001_choice_002_f,It's a great place for <i>hakuna matata</i>.
P
Simba_008_fATeach YOU to be a good ruler? I'm still figuring that out myself.
;
Simba_009_f,But I guess we could figure it out together.
[
Simba_012_fLWe've already got a place for you in the Village. Nala is waiting there now.
,
Simba_013_fI'd love to go. Lead the way!
H
Simba_010_f9Well, I don't know about that, but I do want to see Nala.
w
Simba_011_fhReally? 'Cause after fighting off hyenas and fixing the oasis, I could use a little <i>hakuna matata<i>.

Simba_003_f
I hope so.
m
Simba_005_f^Ha-ha! Don't worry. I'd let you know if I heard a rhino approaching. They make a lot of noise.
