Simba_006_fdWhen I was young, my father told me that the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars.
O
Player_000_choice_000_f4I believe it. There's something magical about stars.
Y
Player_000_choice_001_f>Actually, they're balls of gas burning billions of miles away.
O
Player_000_choice_002_f4Actually, they're fireflies that got stuck up there.
B
Simba_001_f3When I look up at them, I know my father was right.

Simba_016_fHuh? What do you mean?
D
Simba_017_f5Uh, no worries. This might be a bit tough to explain.
E
Simba_018_f6But I think I know somebody who might be able to help.
^
Simba_014_fOI'll go <Lore>talk to Merlin</Lore> and see if he knows what might be going on.

Simba_010_fNIt's nice to think that those who came before are always up there, guiding us.

Simba_007_f0If I could just see them... I'd know what to do.

Simba_008_f-But I can't. Look. There are too many clouds.

Simba_009_feI haven't been able to see the stars for a few nights now. Every time I look up at them, it's cloudy.

Simba_011_f'Wait, how long has this been happening?
[
Simba_012_fLNow that I think about it... I can't remember the last time I saw the stars.
#
Simba_013_fThat's pretty weird.

Simba_015_f*I wonder if something magical is going on.
[
Simba_002_fLThat's what my friend Pumbaa thinks. But it seems kind of far-fetched to me.

Simba_004_f!I prefer my father's explanation.

Simba_003_foReally? That's what my friend Timon told me. I guess they could be, but I still prefer my father's explanation.
