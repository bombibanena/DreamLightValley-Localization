Simba_002_f9They do hide during the day! Or at least I can't see 'em.
U
Simba_003_fFAnd it's fun to chase 'em. That's kind of like them guiding us. Right?
B
Simba_004_f3I think you're right. Stars only come out at night.
:
Simba_005_f+And I know I've been guided by the stars...
Y
Simba_006_fJI'm not sure what that is. But I doubt it's what Rafiki was talking about.
