Simba_001_fIOh, I feel so bad. I completely forgot I was supposed to help Nala today.
o
Simba_005_f`I've gotta make it up to her. And she said that odd thing about me having a special role here...
e
Simba_008_fVYeah, it sounds like her memories started to come back when she was scouting for food.
K
Simba_021_f<Maybe yours will too. And it seems really important to Nala.

Simba_006_fIt is.
¶
Simba_007_f¦She wants to make sure all the animals in the Valley have food. Maybe Nala has the right idea and something isn't right with how the Circle of Life should be working.
5
Player_001_choice_000_fSounds like she was right.
6
Player_001_choice_001_fWhere do you want to start?
9
Player_001_choice_002_fPlease don't eat the critters.
^
Simba_009_fOYeah, if everyone doesn't understand the Circle of Life, bad things can happen.
Á
Simba_010_f±Nala's worried that the rabbits don't have enough to eat. Goofy says they like carrots, so how 'bout we plant and grow some <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem> just to be sure?
d
Simba_013_fULet's take it a little further. I'll feed some of the animals around the Village too.
Ÿ
Simba_014_fGood idea, but some of the creatures around here seem pretty hard for you to approach. I've gotten to know most of them. Do you want some help?
'
Player_002_choice_000_fYes, please!
A
Player_002_choice_001_f&I'm good. Let's go feed some critters!
>
Simba_015_f/Great! Which creatures do you wanna know about?
6
Player_003_choice_000_fThe squirrels and sunbirds.
4
Player_003_choice_001_fThe rabbits or the foxes.
;
Player_003_choice_002_f The baby turtles and the ravens.
7
Player_003_choice_003_fThe raccoons and crocodiles.
A
Player_003_choice_005_f&I'm good. Let's go feed some critters!
I
Simba_017_f:Oh, they don't fear anyone. They'll think you're a friend.
8
Simba_000_f)Just go to them. It won't be any trouble.
3
Simba_018_f$Oh, those guys love to run and play.
Y
Simba_002_fJYou'll have to join their game and catch them if you wanna give them food.
h
Simba_019_fYIt's funny. You'd think turtles and ravens wouldn't have anything in common, but they do.
P
Simba_023_fAThey're both shy, so it'll take time for them to get used to you.
n
Simba_003_f_Just stand near them calmly. That way, they'll know there's nothing to fear, and they'll relax.
y
Simba_020_fjOh, they're the most wary creatures in the Valley. You need to be pretty careful when you approach them...
J
Simba_004_f;When you see them watching their surroundings, stop moving.
~
Simba_022_foOnly move again when you see they're relaxed... but stop as soon as you see them about to stand on guard again.
U
Simba_016_fFOkay. And hey, don't hesitate to ask me again if you change your mind.
2
Simba_011_f#You don't have to worry about that.
T
Simba_012_fEI have enough food around here with all the fish and stuff from Remy.
