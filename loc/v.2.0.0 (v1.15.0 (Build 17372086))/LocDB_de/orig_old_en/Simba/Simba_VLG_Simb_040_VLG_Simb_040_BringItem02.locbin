Simba_003_fQHey, {PlayerName}, Mother Gothel came by to see me. She was... helpful. In a way.
”
Simba_010_f„Anyway, once you've watered enough of them, we'll go back to the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem> on the Sunlit Plateau.
\
Simba_001_fMAnd pretty soon, new <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Trees</ActivityItem> will grow.
*
Player_000_choice_000_fThat's amazing!
7
Player_000_choice_001_fSo our trees are networking?
<
Player_000_choice_002_f!It sounds a little... convenient.
s
Simba_000_fdShe sort of reminds me of my uncle Scar... Which means, you should definitely be careful around her.
L
Simba_011_f=Anyway, she wanted me to tell you what you need to do next...
º
Simba_004_fªFirst, choose the part of the Valley where you want to grow a new <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>, then water the <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem> there.
š
Simba_012_fŠWatering <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem> to grow a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>. Sounds a little strange, but okay...
¸
Simba_013_f¨Mother Gothel said that the roots of <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Trees</ActivityItem> stem from both the one above the Well in the Plaza and the one we planted together...
.
Simba_005_fAnd they span the whole Valley.
Ë
Simba_006_f»Watering <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem> with a special <ActivityItem>Fertilizer</ActivityItem> helps the water reach the roots of the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>...
X
Simba_014_fISo new sprouts can grow there. Then we'll have trees all over the Valley.
&
Simba_002_fYeah, I thought so too.
¸
Simba_008_f¨I guess there's only one way to know if it works. I'll go to the Frosted Heights, Forgotten Lands and Glade of Trust to water some <ActivityItem>Flowers</ActivityItem>.
D
Simba_009_f5If it works there, it'll work anywhere in the Valley.
=
Simba_015_f.Sounds good. I can't wait to see what happens.
T
Simba_016_fEI don't know what you mean... but they're connected. That's for sure.
>
Simba_007_f/Well, maybe it won't be as simple as it sounds.
