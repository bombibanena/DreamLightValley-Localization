Simba_000_fLook at this place.
T
Simba_001_fEI think it used to be a water hole for all the animals in the jungle.
K
Simba_002_f<But it looks like it's been dried out for quite a while now.

Player_000_f Hmm... it looks like it needs...

Player_000_choice_002_f"...something beautiful to look at.
J
Simba_003_f;Yeah. Plants would bring back a lot of the smaller animals.
m
Simba_020_f^And there are the trees in the clearing where you found me. I bet those would have some seeds.
e
Simba_021_fVBut you might need to do some digging to get them. Do you think your paws can do that?
d
Simba_022_fUWho needs paws when you've got a <Lore>Royal Shovel</Lore>? That oughta do the trick!

Simba_004_f-And they would bring back the bigger animals.

Simba_005_fIt's the Circle of Life.
P
Simba_006_fAI think we'll need some water too, or the plants won't last long.
Z
Simba_007_fKWell, if there used to be water here, there must be a way to bring it back.
E
Simba_008_f6I'll try to figure that out while you find the plants.
H
Simba_014_f9What sorts of plants should I get? Where can I find them?
œ
Simba_018_fŒYou could check some of those jungle ferns near the river. Rafiki said plants come from seeds, so maybe you could get some seeds from those.
[
Simba_019_fLOh, and there's a plant near one of the waterfalls that might have some too.
Z
Simba_009_fKYeah. If there used to be water here, there must be a way to bring it back.
V
Simba_010_fGI'll try to figure that part out. And maybe you could find some plants.

N
Simba_015_f?Well, it would look a lot nicer if there were plants and water.

Simba_016_f&That would bring all the animals back.
W
Simba_017_fHHow about I try to figure out the water while you figure out the plants?
