Simba_000_f^My buddy Timon's still a little nervous around Nala. Before they met, she tried to eat Pumbaa.
B
Simba_010_f3I'd like them to be better friends. Got any advice?

Simba_002_fLTimon and Pumbaa would love that. And Nala's starting to come around on 'em.
@
Simba_011_f1She's learning they can be slimy, yet satisfying.
:
Simba_003_f+Uhh... Timon and Pumbaa don't eat antelope.
Z
Simba_012_fKAnd I think seeing Nala eat an antelope would just make Timon more nervous.
U
Simba_004_fFI don't know what that is... but I bet Timon and Pumbaa would like it.
u
Simba_005_ffI think going hunting with Nala would just make Timon more nervous. He's naturally wary of carnivores.
h
Simba_006_fYYou mean spend some time relaxing together? That might help... if Timon can relax at all.
