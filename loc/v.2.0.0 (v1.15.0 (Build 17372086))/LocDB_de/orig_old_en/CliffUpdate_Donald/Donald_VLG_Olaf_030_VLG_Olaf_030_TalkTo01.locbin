Donald_000_fJHey Donald, Olaf wanted me to give you these so you can write the scripts.
?
Donald_008_f/Now he wants me to write it all down for him...
C
Donald_009_f3...AND star in the hardest role in the whole play?!
9
Player_000_f)You think playing yourself would be hard?
P
Player_000_choice_000_f5I guess that's fair. You're very complex and layered.
R
Player_000_choice_001_f7I suppose it would be hard to keep up with your energy.
I
Player_000_choice_002_f.Are you sure you don't just have stage fright?
Z
Donald_001_fJWAK! What's the big idea?! He wants me to write the whole story down too?!
!
Donald_002_f*grumble grumble*
A
Donald_003_f1Oh, and he wanted me to ask you one more thing...

Donald_004_f&Will you star in the play as yourself?
=
Donald_005_f-That's it! Olaf's making me do too much work!

Donald_006_fSI had to tell him the story over and over and over again... while eating popcorn...

M
Donald_010_f=Exactly! It would take me weeks to get into character for it.
D
Donald_011_f4I'm done. Tell Olaf he can write the script himself!
l
Donald_012_f\And he better find somebody good to play Donald Duck, because Donald Duck's not gonna do it!
j
Donald_013_fZExactly! It's exhausting being me! Imagine how exhausting it would be to be me playing me!
