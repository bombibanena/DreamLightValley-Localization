Beast_000_ftHey Beast... I found these pages lying around. It's a chapter from a book. It seems like something Belle might like.
#
Beast_001_fHrm... let me see...
@
Beast_002_f1Oh. I remember Belle telling me about this story.
e
Beast_003_fVShe said that she started reading it before the Forgetting but never got to finish it.
'
Beast_004_fWhere did you find this?
3
Beast_005_f$I found it while exploring the Bind.
r
Beast_006_fcThe Bind... I remember. There are many books in the Bind that Belle might enjoy. She loves to read.

Player_000_choice_000_fMe too! I'm a total bookworm.
:
Player_000_choice_001_fI wish I had more time to read.
M
Player_000_choice_002_f2Books put me to sleep. I'd rather scroll my phone.
=
Beast_007_f.The books in the Valley have worms in them...?
<
Beast_008_f-Uh... figure of speech. Don't worry about it.
M
Beast_009_f>Er... All right... {PlayerName}, I have a favor to ask of you.
H
Beast_010_f9I want... *sigh* It's hard for me to put it into words...
^
Beast_011_fO... I want to create a magical day for Belle. Something worthy of her kindness.
<
Beast_012_f-The Bind seems like the perfect place for it.
F
Player_001_choice_000_f+Ooh! This is so romantic. I'd love to help.
W
Player_001_choice_001_f<You're a big ol' softie underneath that fur and those claws.
F
Player_001_choice_002_f+What's stopping you from doing it yourself?
'
Beast_013_fThank you, {PlayerName}.
L
Beast_014_f=All right, so, a perfect day for Belle... How would it start?
F
Beast_015_f7Well... a perfect day should begin with a perfect gift.
B
Beast_016_f3I don't suppose you've found the rest of this book?
=
Beast_017_f.If we found it, I could bind it back together.
M
Beast_018_f>Good idea. I'll <Lore>try to find the rest of the book</Lore>.
®
Beast_019_fžPerhaps you should start by <Lore>checking the shelves in the Library of Lore</Lore>. Now that you've reminded me of the Bind, I recall that it has a library.
u
Beast_020_ffIn the meantime, I'll look around the Bind and try to think of other ways to make Belle's day special.
_
Beast_021_fPHrm... Well, my fur has been much softer lately since Mr. McDuck sold me someâ€”
2
Beast_022_f#Oh. You didn't mean that literally.
<
Beast_023_f-Well... I suppose I haven't known what to do.
+
Beast_024_fPerhaps we could discuss it.
O
Beast_025_f@So does Belle. That's why... well, I have a favor to ask of you.
F
Beast_026_f7I'm not sure I understand. You prefer scrolls to books?
p
Beast_027_faNo, not scrolls, my phoâ€” Uh, never mind. It would take too long to explain social media to you.
l
Beast_028_f]Very well... I won't pry and waste our time because, you see... I have a favor to ask of you.
