Beast_000_fCYou found the other pages of Belle's book! Thank you, {PlayerName}.
C
Beast_001_f4She'll be so happy she can finally finish the story.

Beast_002_f%But I can't give it to her in pieces.
F
Player_000_choice_000_f+Might be fun to read one chapter at a time!
X
Player_000_choice_001_f=It'll be pretty confusing if she reads it in the wrong order.
I
Player_000_choice_002_f.I guess we could put it back together for her.
@
Beast_003_f1No, no. She's waited long enough to read the end.
D
Beast_004_f5I'll find a way to bind this back together for Belle.
H
Beast_005_f9It might take me some time to get the order just right...
R
Beast_006_fCDid you think about what else Belle would need for her perfect day?
©
Beast_007_f™I did. I would like the Bind to look bright and inviting for her... Maybe <Lore>paths</Lore>, <Lore>lights</Lore>, and something for us to gather around.
m
Beast_008_f^I don't suppose you could see to that while I work on the book? I'm not much of a decorator...
9
Player_001_f)Don't worry, Beast. I'll make the Bind...
0
Player_001_choice_000_f...cozy and inviting!
5
Player_001_choice_001_f...enchanting and magical!
W
Player_001_choice_002_f<...perfectly adequate. I'm not much of a decorator either...
[
Beast_009_fLI know Belle will like that. You're very good at making things... welcoming.
X
Beast_010_fII'll go start rearranging these pages and binding the book back together.
i
Beast_011_fZHmm... which of these would go first...? Well, surely "THE END" goes at the back... *sigh*
h
Beast_012_fYThat's not true. You're very good at this sort of thing. Belle will like whatever you do.
L
Beast_013_f=Yes, I'd rather not have the beginnings and endings mixed up.

Beast_014_f)You've done so much by finding the pages.
