Scar_001_f,Back to bother me again, are we? Oh goody...
W

Scar_002_fII'll be quick, Scar; I promise. Just have a few little questions for you.
D

Scar_003_f6How kind. You only wish to disrupt my day momentarily.
H

Scar_004_f:Go ahead; ask your questions. I'll endeavor to stay awake.
N
Player_000_choice_000_f3OK, calm down. I'll be out of your fur soon enough.
#
Player_000_choice_001_fSo rude!
N
Player_000_choice_002_f3Hold on; I just thought of another dozen questions.
%

Scar_005_fNot soon enough for me.
>

Scar_016_f0Great, I'll pass that along to Jack Skellington.

Scar_017_f$The walking skeleton is behind this?
Q

Scar_018_fCPerhaps I'll put aside my plans to gnaw those old bones... for now.
&

Scar_008_fGet to it, {PlayerName}.
G

Scar_009_f9I wanted to know... what's your favorite holiday and why?
P

Scar_010_fBHoliday? Is that one of those human things you all are so fond of?
O

Scar_011_fAWell, humans like them, but no reason it has to be limited to us!
V

Scar_012_fHA holiday is sort of... a ritual that we do to mark something important.
²

Scar_013_f£Hmm, that does sound like it might have merit. I'm reminded of when the kingdom's subjects gather at Pride Rock to bear witness to the new lion prince or princess.
$

Scar_014_fYeah, kinda like that!
Z

Scar_015_fLHaving subjects gather and pay tribute to one's majesty is quite satisfying.
`

Scar_006_fRYes, you are. Yet somehow I manage to keep my temper in check. How gracious of me.

Scar_007_f,Your attempts at wit are irritating at best.
