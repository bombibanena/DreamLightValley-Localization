Ursula_000_fÜUrsula, we need your help. We've got these <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem>, but we don't know what we need to do next...
A
Ursula_015_f1Well, it's about time you came to see me, dearie.
{
Ursula_006_fkI've had about enough of these pesky fish and all this mystical nonsense clogging up the Village waterways.
X
Ursula_007_fHBut luckily for you... I've figured out exactly how to set things right.
'
Player_001_choice_000_fReally? How?
1
Player_001_choice_001_fOh, thank you, Ursula!
=
Player_001_choice_002_f"Then stop complaining and tell me.
#
Ursula_008_fIt's simple enough.
Y
Ursula_010_fINow, listen closely, {PlayerName}. I don't want to have to repeat myself.

Ursula_012_fòTo make new <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem>, you'll need to find <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Sand</ActivityItem>...
ñ
Ursula_013_fÖThen to focus the magic, each statue will need a gemstone embedded in its forehead. A gemstone from the place where each rift opened.
f
Ursula_004_fVThe rifts opened on Dazzle Beach, in the Glade of Trust, and in the Frosted Heights...
£
Ursula_005_fíAn <ActivityItem>Aquamarine</ActivityItem>, an <ActivityItem>Amethyst</ActivityItem> and a <ActivityItem>Citrine</ActivityItem> ought to do, then.
í
Ursula_014_fÅFinally, you'll need to <ActivityItem>craft the Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> and place them near each rift to ensure it closes.
J
Ursula_016_f:Best of luck, angelfish. I hope it's not too much for you.
D
Ursula_009_f4Finally! Some appreciation for all I do around here.
r
Ursula_011_fbComplaining?! Hardly. If I told you all of my complaints about this place, we'd be here all month.
