Ursula_003_f"My my, angelfish? What's all this?
W
Ursula_004_fGYou might have noticed some weird magical stuff going on around here...
o
Ursula_005_f_Nala and I found these mystical rifts that opened up in the water. And then that fish swam out.
?
Player_000_choice_000_f$Have you ever seen anything like it?
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/We figured you would be the best person to ask.
H
Player_000_choice_002_f-We thought it might be one of your relatives.
p
Ursula_006_f`It doesn't look like any fish I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Let me take a closer look.
@
Ursula_011_f0Gah! The fish disappeared right out of my hands.
M
Ursula_012_f=But I got enough of a look at it to tell you where it's from.
m
Ursula_013_f]And since I'm so generous... perhaps I'll even tell you without asking for anything in trade.
6
Player_002_choice_000_fI'd trade you my gratitude.
6
Player_002_choice_001_fI'd really appreciate that.
/
Player_002_choice_002_fOut with it, Ursula.
h
Ursula_014_fXHardly as valuable as what I'm about to tell you. But that's fine. You'll be in my debt.
E
Ursula_019_f5This fish comes from <Lore>the Here and There</Lore>.
o
Ursula_021_f_I went to the Here and There to get the Orb of Trust back, but I didn't see any fish like this.

Ursula_029_foPoor Nala. She was supposed to be the protector of this Valley, but now she might lead it to its destruction...
=
Ursula_000_f-... All because of one clumsy little mistake.
1
Player_004_choice_000_fIt's not Nala's fault.
>
Player_004_choice_001_f#She shouldn't have meddled in this.
>
Player_004_choice_002_f#Stop gloating and help us fix this.
i
Ursula_023_fYYou may have visited, but you merely went as deep as sea-foam skimming the ocean surface.
\
Ursula_024_fLThis fish came from somewhere much deeper in the Here and There than that...
<
Ursula_020_f,Like where Minnie went when she disappeared?
-
Ursula_022_fAh-ha! Now you're getting it.
~
Ursula_025_fnIt seems you and Nala have done something to rip open the walls between... well... between the Here and There!
[
Ursula_026_fKWhat about those <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> I showed you?
í
Ursula_027_fÅIf I'm not mistaken, this has happened before. Long ago. Those statues must have been part of some enchantment to seal the rifts.
P
Ursula_028_f@But now that you've disturbed them... the enchantment is broken.
[
Ursula_030_fKNo, of course not. This magic isn't something a lion should be meddling in.
B
Ursula_032_f2At least you're wise enough to know to come to me.
`
Ursula_034_fPNow, if we don't fix this soon, who knows what else might leak into the Village?
L
Ursula_035_f<I'll need some time to figure out how to shut them for good.
d
Ursula_036_fTI'm afraid that in these matters, time is the one thing that can't be bargained for.
I
Ursula_031_f9Certainly not. Magic like this is no business for a lion.
W
Ursula_033_fGI'm not running a charity here, {PlayerName}. Let me have a little fun.
<
Ursula_015_f,Just remember: You're in my debt, angelfish.
U
Ursula_016_fEManners, angelfish. Or I'll keep this valuable information to myself.
,
Ursula_017_f*sigh* Fine. Please tell me.
A
Ursula_018_f1Much better. And remember: Now you're in my debt.
w
Ursula_007_fgYou thought right, dearie. With magic like this, you should always talk to me, not that windbag wizard.
S
Ursula_010_fCNow, let me take a closer look at this odd creature you've found...
j
Ursula_008_fZMy relatives?! How dare you?! I ought to turn you into a barnacle for an insult like that.
V
Ursula_009_fFYou're lucky I'm just as curious as you about what this fish might be.
