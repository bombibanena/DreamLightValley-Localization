Scrooge_000_fƒHave I ever told you about any of my great adventures, {PlayerName}? Searching a Scottish castle? Hunting for gold in the Klondike?

F
Player_000_choice_001_f+Did you find a lot of gold in the Klondike?

Player_000_choice_002_fTell me something different.
r
Scrooge_001_faI was searching for a family treasure hidden in the McDuck family's ancestral castle in Scotland.
¦
Scrooge_004_f”The treasure had been lost for years, but I found it with an X-ray machine! There was also a meddling ghost, but Donald and I got the better of him!
k
Scrooge_002_fZThat I did! I found a golden rock the size of a goose egg. It was the start of my fortune!
Z
Scrooge_005_fII used it to buy land in Duckburg. And the rest, as they say, is history.
L
Scrooge_003_f;Aye, I'll tell you the story of how I earned my first dime!
™
Scrooge_006_f‡I was a young lad in Glasgow, earning my way shining shoes. My very first customer was a ditch digger with an inch of mud on his boots!
_
Scrooge_007_fNI scrubbed with all the strength in my small body and left his boots spotless.
_
Scrooge_008_fNBut he paid me with an American dime, which was useless in Glasgow! The cheat!
Z
Scrooge_009_fII vowed then to always be honest in my dealings and earn my money square.
