Scrooge_002_fjBy being smarter than the smarties and tougher than the toughies! I'm not like some folks, born to riches.

Scrooge_008_fçOch, that's a hard question. Money's a powerful thing. You've got to have rules about how money can be spent, and how workers can be treated.

Scrooge_004_fìWell, you have to work hard and be clever and stubborn, too. And it doesn't hurt to be lucky. But most importantly, you have to treat folks fairly.
