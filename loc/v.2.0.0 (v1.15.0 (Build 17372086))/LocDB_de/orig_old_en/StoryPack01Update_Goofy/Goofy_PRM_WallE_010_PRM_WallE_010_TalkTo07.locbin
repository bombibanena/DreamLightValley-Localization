Goofy_010_f#In the Meadow? How'd it get there?!
3
Goofy_011_f$No idea. It's a real head-scratcher.
^
Goofy_012_fOI picked up a piece on the Beach and was trying to bring it to Uncle Scrooge...
E
Goofy_013_f6But I put it down for just a second to rest my arms...
B
Goofy_014_f3And then I musta slipped on some mud and fell over!
?
Goofy_015_f0Next thing I knew, the big metal chunk was gone!
S
Player_001_choice_000_f8... You pushed it into the pond by accident, didn't you?
B
Player_001_choice_001_f'Could be someone played a prank on you!
3
Player_001_choice_002_fI honestly have no idea.
N
Goofy_002_f?Bet you had pancakes and pickles for breakfast like I did, huh?

I
Goofy_004_f:Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something...
*
Goofy_005_fYou betcha, pal! What's up?
ü
Goofy_006_fèWell, WALL¬∑E really wants to find a trash can lid. I don't know exactly why, but he really wants it! I haven't seen any in the Valley, though.
o
Goofy_007_f`Hmm... I haven't seen any trash can lids around here. But maybe you could make one from scratch.
Q
Goofy_008_fBLast time I was in the Meadow fishin', my line kept getting stuck.
o
Goofy_009_f`I betcha it's a buncha that <ActivityItem>Scrap Metal</ActivityItem> I keep findin' around here.
B
Goofy_016_f3I hadn't thought of that, but you're prob'ly right!
ô
Goofy_017_fâAll right Goofy, I should be able to handle this ‚Äî the Royal Fishing Rod will have a better chance of pulling the metal out than yours.
r
Goofy_018_fcThat's true. And I hope you can find the other pieces out there too ‚Äî I saw a bunch on the Beach!
f
Goofy_019_fWSome were just layin' around, some were buried in the sand, and some were in the water.
S
Goofy_020_fDPerfect ‚Äî we'll look into those! Were those the only ones you saw?
r
Goofy_021_fcNope. I saw Ursula grab some. I offered to recycle 'em for her, but she said she had plans for 'em.
B
Goofy_022_f3And then she did one of those scary villain laughs.
@
Goofy_023_f1Oof, okay, I'll look into that ‚Äî thanks, Goofy!
X
Goofy_024_fINot sure what kind of prank that'd be... but I suppose it could be funny.
G
Goofy_025_f8Wow, if YOU can't figure it out, it really is a mystery!
&
Goofy_026_fUh-oh! Hope I can help!

Goofy_027_fUh-oh! What's wrong, pal?
