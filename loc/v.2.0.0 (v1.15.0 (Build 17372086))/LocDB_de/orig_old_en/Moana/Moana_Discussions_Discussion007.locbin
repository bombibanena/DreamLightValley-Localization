Moana_001_fRMy Gramma Tala. My father's mother. I loved her so much. She... she understood me.
V
Moana_004_fGShe told me the story of Te Fiti. And that our ancestors were voyagers.
q
Moana_005_fbSometimes I feel her spirit with me, but I still miss what we had. I was really lucky to have her.
E
Moana_002_f6I know. The sadness... it's softer than it used to be.
ƒ
Moana_006_ftWhen she died I was so sad; it was like a sharp pain. But now it's like a distant ache. Familiar, almost comforting.
'
Moana_007_fI guess that's the love.
i
Moana_003_fZYou're right. And that's really comforting. She wouldn't want me to stay sad. And I won't.
J
Moana_008_f;But she was important. I don't want my heart to forget her.
