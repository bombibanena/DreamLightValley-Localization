Moana_003_f#...and maybe a little bit exciting.
Q
Moana_002_fBIt depends on what you're doing. Cloudy days are good for fishing.
T
Moana_004_fEThe sun feels amazing, but you want to make sure you have some shade.
O
Moana_005_f@So it's good that you can use a sail for shade when you need it.
