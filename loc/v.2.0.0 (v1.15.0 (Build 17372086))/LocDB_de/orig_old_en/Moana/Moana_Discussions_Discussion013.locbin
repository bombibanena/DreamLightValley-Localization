Moana_000_fCHave you noticed anything interesting in the seas around the Beach?
^
Moana_001_fOI found lots of little islands. But there's something strange about this place.
U
Moana_002_fFWhenever I try to go back and find the same island twice... it's gone.
A
Player_000_choice_000_f&Maybe you navigated to the wrong spot?
;
Player_000_choice_001_f Maybe it drifted somewhere else?
M
Player_000_choice_002_f2Maybe... I don't know. Dreamlight Valley is weird.
 
Moana_004_fI don't think so.

Moana_005_f&I've gotten pretty good at wayfinding.
o
Moana_010_f`Something weird is happening with the waters around the Village. I just need to figure out what.
a
Moana_006_fRThat's the funny thing. I think they ARE moving, but it's even stranger than that.
c
Moana_007_fTSometimes I'll be sailing towards an island and I'll blink... and all of a sudden...
W
Moana_008_fH...it's just gone. And then ten minutes later, I find it somewhere else.
Y
Moana_009_fJI need to figure out how to map them... or if there's any pattern to it...
#
Moana_011_fYou're right. It is.
c
Moana_012_fTI just wonder if it's weird in a way that I can figure out, and use that to help us.
