Gaston_000_fPHey, Gaston â€” did you do your rugged contemplation of nature? How do you feel?
F
Gaston_023_f6I don't blame her â€” I'll head to see her next, then.
e
Gaston_029_fUI'll come with you! You'll need someone charming like me to deal with people for you.
A
Gaston_004_f1Oh, uhhh, not sure if that's such a great idea...

Gaston_005_fWhat? Why not?
@
Gaston_035_f0Actually, I have something else only you can do.
`
Gaston_036_fPI bet I'll find the other Scarab piece soon, and then we'll be off to the vault!
@
Player_005_choice_000_f%We'll need some adventuring supplies.
C
Player_005_choice_001_f(Can you pack some food and drink for us?
d
Player_005_choice_002_fII need you to talk to Jafar and get a hint of what awaits us in the Cave.
Q
Gaston_002_fA{PlayerName}, I make it a habit of ignoring all talk of feelings.

Gaston_016_f*Did you find the next piece of the Scarab?
ƒ
Gaston_020_fsNot yet. Any chance you've got leads on the next half of the Scarab Key? Jafar said it might be in the Wild Tangle.
{
Gaston_021_fkThe Mirage Wizard may be right. I've been over every inch of the Dunes, and I haven't found the other half.
j
Gaston_003_fZ{PlayerName}, I've a thought! I once spotted a blonde girl dashing around the Wild Tangle.
/
Gaston_022_fMaybe the jungle girl can help.
&
Gaston_006_fOh, you mean Rapunzel?
l
Gaston_007_f\Is that her name? The one time I saw her, she took one look at Coconut LeFou and dashed off.
d
Gaston_037_fTYou're right. I am an expert on adventuring! I'll get the ol' explorer's pack going.
<
Gaston_038_f,Awesome, that's what I like to hear, Gaston.
:
Gaston_039_f*No one prepares for adventure like Gaston!
b
Gaston_040_fRGreat, I'll check back <Lore>after I talk with Rapunzel in the Wild Tangle</Lore>.
f
Gaston_041_fVOf course I can! I know the desert plants like the back of my incredibly muscled hand.
I
Gaston_042_f9The Mirage Wizard will crumble at my intense questioning!
