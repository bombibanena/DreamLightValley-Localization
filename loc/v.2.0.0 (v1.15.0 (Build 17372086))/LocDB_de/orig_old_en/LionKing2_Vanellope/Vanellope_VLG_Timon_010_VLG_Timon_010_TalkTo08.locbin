Vanellope_000_fHowdy-do, {PlayerName}!
I
Vanellope_001_f6Hey, Vanellope. I just wanted to come check in on you.
$
Vanellope_012_fOkay... What for?

Vanellope_019_flI know you put an Anti-Lion Security Device in Scar's Den. I had to destroy it before anything bad happened!
C
Vanellope_020_f0What?! But what about Timon? He's really scared!
Ë
Vanellope_021_f·I'll talk to Timon. But I also want to remind you that this is a place where everyone is welcome... even the Villains. As long as Scar is behaving himself, we have no reason to worry.
<
Vanellope_022_f)*sigh* I suppose you're right. I'm sorry.
=
Player_000_choice_000_f"Have you spoken to Timon recently?
.
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat are you up to?
;
Player_000_choice_002_f Been hanging around Scar at all?
2
Vanellope_002_fYeah! I love that little fella.
T
Vanellope_005_fAA bit twitchy sometimes, but you can't really blame him, can you?
$
Vanellope_007_fWhat do you mean?
]
Vanellope_008_fJWell... Timon and Scar have a very complicated history. Did you know that?
2
Player_001_choice_000_fI've heard some things.
3
Player_001_choice_001_fComplicated in what way?
K
Player_001_choice_002_f0Really? I thought they were the best of friends.
‹
Vanellope_013_fxI mean, it's not surprising... predator and prey, always fighting. Not to mention whatever happened with Scar and Simba!
h
Vanellope_016_fUI know Timon feels a little insecure living in Dreamlight Valley with Scar here, too.

Vanellope_010_flAnd that's why I'm gonna help him get over it! Don't worry, {PlayerName}; I've got everything under control.
Š
Vanellope_023_fwI promised Timon I wouldn't say anything, but I'll give you a hint... It involves a net. But that's all you're getting.
S
Vanellope_011_f@Just, uh... maybe don't go around Scar's Den anytime soon, okay?
‘
Vanellope_014_f~Oh, you know, predator, prey, opposite ends of the food chain... plus all that stuff between Scar and Simba. It's pretty wild!
R
Vanellope_015_f?Could I get a little more "sar" with that "casm," {PlayerName}?
 
Vanellope_018_fSorry, sorry.
E
Vanellope_003_f2Oh, you know me â€” just helpin' out my neighbors!
(
Vanellope_004_fPfft, what? Me? Scar?
H
Vanellope_006_f5Why would I do that? I've heard he's extra dangerous.
