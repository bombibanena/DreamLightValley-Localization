j
Daisy_001_f[Befriend rabbits with fresh carrots, obviously... Give me a challenge... Ah-ha! Here we go.
m
Daisy_008_f^{PlayerName}, most of these require simple advice. But I think two of them need direct action.
&
Player_000_choice_000_fCan I help?
@
Player_000_choice_001_f%Aren't they supposed to be anonymous?
/

@
Daisy_015_f1Vanellope wrote you a letter? What does she want?
Å
Daisy_016_frHer letter says she wants to "take my game to the next level and be a total boss." (Just like yours truly, I bet.)
-
Daisy_017_fIt's obvious what she needs...
L
Daisy_018_f=...a new wardrobe that helps her feel confident and powerful!
-
Player_001_choice_000_fWhat a great idea!
;

%
Daisy_019_fI'm so glad you agree.
Y
Daisy_022_fJOkay... So <Lore>new wardrobe</Lore> for Vanellope... What about Kristoff?
a
Daisy_023_fRHe wants to do something romantic for Anna and is wondering which flowers to pick.
|
Daisy_024_fmThe answer, of course, is ALL of them... And chocolate too. One of the many things Anna and I have in common.
1
Player_002_choice_000_f"Yes" to big gestures!
@
Player_002_choice_001_f%Kristoff is a little more reserved...

,
Daisy_025_fA fellow romantic. I knew it.
)
Daisy_028_fWhat do you need me to do?
Q
Daisy_029_fBLet's talk to Minnie about designing a "BOSS" dress for Vanellope.
ë
Daisy_030_fÅAs for Kristoff, could you make sure that Arendelle Castle is surrounded by flowers and prepare lots of chocolate meals for Anna?

Daisy_031_fpOh, and when you're done, please check the <ActivityItem>Advice Box</ActivityItem>. There might be more letters!
Q
Daisy_026_fBWell, this can help him break out of his shell. Anna will love it!
l
Daisy_027_f]What do you think? A chocolate fountain? A statue of them dancing together MADE of chocolate?
;
Player_003_choice_000_f If only! That would be adorable!
C
Player_003_choice_001_f(Let's think less showy... like Kristoff.
}
Daisy_003_fnYou're right. In fact, I might want to save that as a Valentine's Day surprise for Donald. We need to refocus!
0
Daisy_002_f!Hm. All right... Here's the plan.
g
Daisy_020_fXSometimes it doesn't need to be complicated. A new wardrobe IS the next level; trust me!
ç
Daisy_021_f~I'm very comfortable in my clothes, thank you very much. Looking your best and feeling great don't have to be separate things.
z
Daisy_010_fkSome are. Some sign their names. And sometimes I can just tell ‚Äî we are a fairly small Village after all.
E
Daisy_011_f6Oh no, don't worry. When we're done, they'll thank us!
