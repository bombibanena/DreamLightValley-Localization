Daisy_000_fJ{PlayerName}, what did you find out from our party-guests-turned-suspects?
-
Player_001_choice_000_fAbout Vanellope...
,
Player_001_choice_001_fAbout Kristoff...
1
Player_001_choice_002_fWhat did YOU find out?
Ä
Daisy_001_fqVanellope was VERY bored for the whole party... And she tried to pin the glitter bomb on literally everyone else.
+
Player_002_choice_000_fVERY suspicious.
3
Player_002_choice_001_fGlitter isn't her thing.
h
Daisy_016_fYHmm... Vanellope COULD be our troublemaker, but I don't want to assume anything just yet.
J
Daisy_015_f;You're right. And I don't want to assume anything just yet.
A
Daisy_012_f2Kristoff just said a bunch of nice stuff about me?
0
Player_003_choice_000_fHe's not the culprit.
>
Player_003_choice_001_f#Too MANY nice things... SUSPICIOUS.

Daisy_014_fI agree. This isn't his style.
[
Daisy_017_fLI don't know about that, {PlayerName}. Kristoff isn't the glitter bomb type.
[
Daisy_018_fLWell, I know it wasn't Donald. He really wanted the party to go well for me.
Å
Daisy_013_frBut as I was talking to Minnie, I had a thought. What if the guilty party was someone who DIDN'T attend the party?

Daisy_003_f	Like who?
}
Daisy_021_fnMy first thought was Mother Gothel ‚Äî because of her "Ask Daisy" letter. But the evidence points elsewhere...

Daisy_005_fScrooge McDuck.

Player_004_choice_000_fWhat's your evidence?
.
Player_004_choice_001_fSeems kinda random.
E
Player_004_choice_002_f*Sabotaging another entrepreneur? The gall!
`
Daisy_007_fQThe glitter bomb was in a box among the furniture I rented from him for the gala!
î
Daisy_022_fÑHe probably thought it would be a funny prank. Or, knowing him, he might've thought it would be an impressive addition to the party.
%
Player_000_fLet me talk to him...
1
Player_000_choice_000_fI'll make him confess.
B
Player_000_choice_001_f'I'll determine if he's innocent or not.
G
Player_000_choice_002_f,I still think Vanellope was more suspicious.
'
Daisy_008_fGood luck, {PlayerName}.
6
Daisy_009_f'Oh, it's him, {PlayerName}. You'll see.
r
Daisy_010_fcWe don't have ANY physical proof Vanellope was involved. We need to follow this Uncle Scrooge lead.

Daisy_020_fMy thoughts exactly!
