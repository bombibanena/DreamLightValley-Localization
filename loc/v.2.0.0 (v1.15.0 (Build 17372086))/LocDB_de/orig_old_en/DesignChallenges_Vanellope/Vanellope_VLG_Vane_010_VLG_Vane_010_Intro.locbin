Vanellope_000_fvHey, {PlayerName}! I've been thinkin'... Your Valley is totally great, but it MIGHT be missing something... Got a sec?
+
Player_000_choice_000_fFor you? Always!
2
Player_000_choice_001_fI'll talk to you later.

Vanellope_001_flOkay, so I can't believe you have all this space, and all this neat stuff, but you don't have a CANDY BIOME!
/
Player_001_choice_000_fThat's a sweet idea!
B
Player_001_choice_001_f'There's a Beach? Did you see the Beach?
.
Player_001_choice_002_fThat sounds sticky.
+
Vanellope_002_fSo glad you agree, chum!
¨
Vanellope_003_f”If I'm gonna stay, we'll hafta make some candy-related changes around here. I may no longer be a Sugar Rush racer, but my love for candy never dies.
m
Vanellope_004_fZFirst things first: landscaping. Take these <ActivityItem>Candy Cane Seeds</ActivityItem>.
:
Player_002_choice_000_fThese look like normal candy...
+
Player_002_choice_001_fCan I eat these?
/
Player_002_choice_002_fAre you pranking me?
S
Vanellope_005_f@They are candy. Kinda. Special tree-sprouting candy. You'll see.
¼
Vanellope_006_f¨<Lore>Plant 'em, sprout 'em and then bring 'em to me when you're done.</Lore> In the meantime, I'll try to find some more stuff around here that we can use to decorate.
X
Vanellope_007_fEWouldn't recommend it, pal, unless you want a tree-sized stomachache!
{
Vanellope_008_fhOh please, WHEN I prank you, it'll be way funnier than asking you to bury candy in the ground. Trust me.
O
Vanellope_009_f<I did, BUT it's all sand and no sugar. A missed opportunity.

Vanellope_010_fUh, yeah! Sticky and awesome.
Y
Vanellope_011_fFOkay, but I'm tellin' ya, my ideas are golden! See ya later, sourball!
