Vanellope_000_fFinally! Somebody's here!
F
Vanellope_001_f3Wait! Wait! I've been rehearsing for this moment...
Š
Vanellope_002_fwGreetings! I am Vanellope von Schweetz, princess and president of Sugar Rush, and Slaughter Race driver extraordinaire!
S
Vanellope_003_f@Soooo... Who're you? And what's this freakishly sparkling place?
C
Vanellope_004_f0I'm {PlayerName}, and this is Dreamlight Valley.

Player_000_choice_000_fHow come you're here?
(
Player_000_choice_001_fAre you okay?
1
Player_000_choice_002_fSo you're NOT a ghost?
‹
Vanellope_005_fxTechnically, I'm not here. I don't think I'm ANYWHERE, actually. Or I'm everywhere... That's the thing â€” I don't know!
‘
Vanellope_006_f~Normally I have complete control over my glitch. But one day, POW! I glitched onto this freaky network I've never seen before.
J
Vanellope_007_f7Now I'm stuck. I have no control, and I don't know why!
A
Player_001_choice_000_f&Magic and technology don't always mix.
7
Player_001_choice_001_fThat sounds kind of scary...
O
Vanellope_008_f<Maybe the Dreamlight Magic here is messing with your glitch?
k
Vanellope_009_fXUgh. Why am I not surprised that a place called "Dreamlight Alley" is lousy with magic?!
?
Vanellope_010_f,There's got to be some way I can help you...

Vanellope_011_fnWell, do you have one of those doohickeys where you talk into it and it takes pictures? 'Cause I have an idea.
*
Vanellope_012_fDo you mean a phone...?
j
Vanellope_013_fWYeah, that's it! I'm seeing a lot of photos being shared on the network I'm stuck in...
€
Vanellope_014_fmIf you <Lore>try taking a picture and sharing it on the network,</Lore> maybe we can see what it's all about.
x
Vanellope_015_feBut hey, leave the Castle and take a picture of something awesome, will ya? Show me what I'm missing!
P
Vanellope_016_f=C'mon! You can't say no to this face. Look how adorable I am!
m
Vanellope_017_fZAw, I'm not scared, I'm just... really frustrated! I like to have both hands on the wheel!
K
Vanellope_018_f8Do I look okay to you? I'm glitching all over the place!
J
Vanellope_019_f7Not unless I died of boredom from glitching everywhere.
