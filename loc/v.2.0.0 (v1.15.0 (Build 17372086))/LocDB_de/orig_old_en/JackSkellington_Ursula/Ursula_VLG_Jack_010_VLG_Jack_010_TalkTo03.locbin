Ursula_000_fUgh, no... not HIM again!
N
Ursula_001_f>This is Jack Skellington! I guess... you two have already met.

Ursula_002_fUnfortunately.
(
Ursula_003_f... And how did that go?
;
Ursula_004_f+Well, he barged into my home earlier today.
C
Ursula_005_f3At first I thought he was looking to make a deal...
i
Ursula_006_fY...but he went straight to my potions, grabbed several, and started mixing them together!
E
Player_000_choice_000_f*But you worked so hard on your collection!

Player_000_choice_001_f... I wish that surprised me.
H
Ursula_007_f8Precisely. At least someone recognizes all my hard work.
H
Ursula_009_f8That menace kept asking where I kept my frog's breath...
B
Ursula_010_f2Then he mixed Kraken's Ink with Steam Vent Salt...
u
Ursula_011_feI'm just glad I had some Essence of Moonlit Kelp handy to stop my whole House from going up in smoke.

Player_001_choice_000_fOh no!


Ursula_012_fOh yes!
G
Ursula_015_f7I want to make this right â€” what potions did he ruin?
c
Ursula_016_fS{PlayerName}, angelfish, though you do have your strengths with Dreamlight Magic...
A
Ursula_017_f1...the kind of potions I make are far beyond you.
•
Ursula_018_f„Still, you can fetch me some Ingredients, and as long as that nuisance is properly reprimanded, I suppose we can put this behind us.
I
Ursula_019_f9Oh trust me, I'll talk to him about it. What do you need?
Ö
Ursula_020_fÅBring me <ActivityItem>Gooseberry</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Red Nasturtium Flowers</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>White Passion Lilies</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Amethysts</ActivityItem>.

Ursula_021_f
I'm on it!
N
Ursula_013_f>Neither did I â€” potions seem to react oddly to his presence.
Š
Ursula_014_fzWell, next time he can ask and offer something in exchange, or I'll turn him into a skinny stalk of seaweed for my garden.

Ursula_008_f-Oh, you know about his tendency for rudeness?
