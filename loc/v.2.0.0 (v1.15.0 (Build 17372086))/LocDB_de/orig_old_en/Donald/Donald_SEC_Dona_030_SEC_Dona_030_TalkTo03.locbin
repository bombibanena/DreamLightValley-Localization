Donald_000_fZI saw that blue alien hop out of his spaceship. I remember him from before the Forgetting!
B
Donald_001_f2His name is Stitch. And he loves to cause trouble.
R
Donald_014_fBBut I think the Forgetting made him even more trouble than before.
Ç
Donald_002_frDo you know what this means, Donald? You were right all along. There WAS a space alien stealing everybody's socks!

Donald_003_f
I knew it!
R
Donald_004_fBAnd nobody believed me! I was the only one who had it figured out!
A
Player_000_choice_000_f&Now you can brag about it to everyone.
P
Player_000_choice_001_f5I think we have more important things to worry about.
8
Player_000_choice_002_fDon't let it go to your head.
H
Donald_005_f8Ha! I can't wait to show Uncle Scrooge that I was right.
†
Donald_008_fèI'd hold off on bragging to Mr. McDuck until we know for sure that Stitch isn't going to destroy all the most valuable property in the Village.
o
Donald_006_f_Aw, I guess you're right. But we can't have Stitch running around the Village destroying stuff.
.
Donald_010_fWe gotta catch him... but how?
z
Donald_011_fjWell, his spaceship got destroyed. I guess that was his only place to live. He seemed pretty mad about it.
d
Donald_012_fTMaybe we can start by <Lore>asking your Uncle Scrooge to make a home for him</Lore>.
]
Donald_013_fMThat's a good idea. That way, Stitch can wreck his own House instead of mine.
L
Donald_007_f<Aw, don't worry, {PlayerName}. You know me. I'm very humble.
Q
Donald_009_fAGood. Then you won't be too busy bragging to help me with Stitch.
