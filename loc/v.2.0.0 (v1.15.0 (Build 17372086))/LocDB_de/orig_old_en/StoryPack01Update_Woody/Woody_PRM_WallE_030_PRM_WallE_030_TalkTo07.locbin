Woody_001_f¤Oh no! What do we do?! Gather a posse?! Call the sheriff?! Wait â€” I'm the sheriff! Guess I'm more used to dealing with pets, cranky toddlers, and vacuum cleaners.

Woody_013_faNight Thorns have grown up around a bunch of Mining Rocks. Think you could help me clear 'em out?
ƒ
Woody_014_ftI'd take care of it myself, but it'd be pretty tricky for me to handle a pickaxe, what with bein' toy-sized and all.
