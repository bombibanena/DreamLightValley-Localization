Remy_001_fHHey, {PlayerName}! Are you ready to challenge your cooking skills again?
,

Remy_002_fToday's customer is Vanellope!
å

Remy_003_f~I've been trying to convince her that vegetables can taste as good ‚Äî no, even BETTER ‚Äî than candy when you use them right.
a

Remy_004_fSBut she doesn't believe me. She says she's never tasted a vegetable that she liked.
U
Player_006_choice_000_f:Vanellope's right ‚Äî candy is way better than vegetables.
U
Player_006_choice_001_f:We need both vegetables AND candy to have a balanced diet.
s
Player_006_choice_002_fXYou're right ‚Äî a little butter, maybe some spice, and a vegetable beats candy any day.

Remy_053_f'No, {PlayerName}. You can't possibly‚Äî
L

Remy_054_f>You know what? I'm going to assume you're joking. Moving on...
ö

Remy_059_fãI need you to make her some <ActivityItem>5-Star Vegetable Meals</ActivityItem>. There's no way she won't like at least ONE of them, right?

Remy_006_f7Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.
û

Remy_007_fèAnd remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.
p

Remy_012_fbHey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.
≠

Remy_013_fûRemember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.
h

Remy_055_fZI suppose that's a position I can get behind. Like they say, variety is the spice of life.
c

Remy_057_fUWell, I'm hoping you can help me convince Vanellope to diversify her palate a little.
,

Remy_056_fRight?! I'm so glad you agree.

Remy_058_f/Now I'm just hoping you can convince Vanellope.
