Buzz_006_f_Woody filled me in on the situation. How are we going to put Bonnie's farm back together again?
û

Buzz_001_fèWell, I've been thinking... Bonnie made special blueprints that show exactly how she wanted it to look. They're still taped up around the room.

Buzz_008_fXHmm... You mean all those drawings on the walls? The ones on colored construction paper?

Buzz_014_f.Impressive observational skills, {PlayerName}.

Buzz_015_f}There's just one problem. Some of them are hard to reach. Woody got himself knocked out the window trying to get to them all.

Buzz_002_fPHmm... I could <Lore>take pictures of all of the drawings</Lore> with my camera?
q

Buzz_003_fcExcellent idea. Then we'll look at the drawings and recreate the farm exactly the way Bonnie wants.
`

Buzz_004_fRUsing all the tools at your disposal, eh? Now that's thinking like a Space Ranger.
P

Buzz_005_fBJust let me know as soon as you have pictures of all the drawings.
