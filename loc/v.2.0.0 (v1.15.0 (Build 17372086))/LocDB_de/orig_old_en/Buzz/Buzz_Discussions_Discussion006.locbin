Buzz_000_f7Attention, {PlayerName}! This is a Zurg invasion drill!
"
Player_000_choice_000_fA what?
;
Player_000_choice_001_f You know Zurg's not real, right?

Player_000_choice_002_fAn invasion? Give me details!
w

Buzz_001_fiThe evil Emperor Zurg is the sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. And by association, Dreamlight Valley!
i

Buzz_002_f[He's extremely dangerous, dresses exclusively in purple, and speaks with a very deep voice.

Player_000_choice_003_f You know Zurg's not real, right?
?
Player_000_choice_004_f$Right! Got it. And he's invading us?
§

Buzz_003_f˜Yes. I'm well aware that I'm a toy and Zurg â€” if he were here â€” would also be a toy. However, Zurg attack drills help keep everyone alert and ready.

Buzz_004_f_It's important to prepare for real threats, such as pets or over-enthusiastic younger siblings.

Player_000_choice_006_f"Okay. Tell me about this invasion.
B
Player_000_choice_007_f'I don't think I need an invasion drill.

Buzz_005_ftEmperor Zurg has sent three spacecraft to attack our Valley. They're armed with lasers and converging on the Castle.

Buzz_006_fHow will you respond?

Player_000_choice_009_f#Ask Merlin to stop them with magic!
R
Player_000_choice_010_f7Ask Mickey to distract them and steal their spaceships!

Player_000_choice_011_fInvite them to a picnic!

Buzz_007_fwLeveraging the Valley's unique advantage! A sound tactic. Zurg doesn't know about magic. He'll be completely flummoxed.
˜

Buzz_010_f‰Well done, {PlayerName}. You've passed the invasion drill with flying colors. If this had been a real invasion, the Valley would be safe.

Buzz_008_f6Turning the enemy's tools against them! Good strategy!
D

Buzz_009_f6An... unconventional strategy. But it just might work.
u

Buzz_011_fgThat's what many think. Then an invasion of cranky toddlers happens, and they're completely unprepared.
