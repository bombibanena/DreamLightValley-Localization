Mickey_000_f*Hiya, {PlayerName}! Do you need some help?
`
Mickey_002_fPI do. Donald thinks the Village is under invasion by sock-stealing space aliens.
=
Mickey_003_f-Ha-ha! Yeah, I've heard him talkin' about it.
4
Player_000_f$I've been investigating to try to...
B
Player_000_choice_000_f'...find the space aliens and stop them!
B
Player_000_choice_001_f'...prove there aren't any space aliens.
9
Player_000_choice_002_f...figure out what's going on.
\
Mickey_005_fLGosh, so you really think we've got space aliens stealin' socks around here?
<
Mickey_006_f,I know it. I'm on the trail of another clue.
T
Mickey_009_fDI found this <ActivityItem>Knitted Sock</ActivityItem>. Is it yours?
í
Mickey_010_fÅI don't think so. It doesn't look like any of my other socks, so even if the Forgetting made me forget, I doubt it's one of mine.
H
Mickey_011_f8Say... I think I remember somebody making those, though.
+
Mickey_015_fIt was the Fairy Godmother!
ú
Mickey_017_fãShe's always doing whatever she can to make sure everybody in the Village is happy and taken care of... even making sure our feet are warm!
O
Mickey_014_f?I bet she conjured these to give to somebody special as a gift.
]
Mickey_013_fMI guess I'll have to figure out who that someone special was. Thanks, Mickey!
Ä
Mickey_012_fpIt was somebody who used to take care of everybody in the Village... including making sure our feet stayed warm.
`
Mickey_016_fPIf I try real hard, I can almost remember what she looked like... but not quite.
a
Mickey_007_fQSo you don't think there are space aliens here? But who's stealing all the socks?
W
Mickey_008_fGThat's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm on the trail of another clue.
b
Mickey_018_fROh boy! So you think there might really be sock-stealin' space aliens around here?
M
Mickey_019_f=We can't rule anything out. I'm on the trail of another clue.
