D
Hades_003_f5Excellent! Because have I got an opportunity for you!

Hades_004_fI'm listening.
¢
Hades_005_f’So, put yourself in my sandals. You're a god; you've got incredible power, sizzling wit and hey, not a bad mug, if I do say so myself. You follow?
,
Player_001_choice_000_fSure, keep going.
,
Player_001_choice_001_fI'd rather not...
K
Player_001_choice_002_f0I have the sudden urge to scheme with the Fates.
…
Hades_006_fvSomeone like me deserves a little class. A lot, actually. I'm talkin' about a domain to reflect my status and dignity.
‹
Hades_007_f|But have you seen the <Lore>Elysian Fields</Lore>?! It's a disaster! Broken statues everywhere! Demon Snippets running amok!

p
Hades_024_faOh, and hey... if some of those flowers happen to be on the head of a dryad... you don't know me.
k
Hades_011_f\...and then SOMEONE decides they need to redecorate your place with green flames and thorns.
6
Hades_017_f'Huh, that kinda sounds like Maleficent.
l
Hades_018_f]BINGO! Shame, really. I thought she and I were gonna be simpatico until things went sideways.
j
Hades_019_f[She really did a number here. I'm still tryin' to figure out how I'm gonna get back at her.
/
Hades_020_f Okay, what do you need me to do?
Ü
Hades_021_fÌWell, those chunks of sculpture are pretty tough. But, bring me some <ActivityItem>of the magical resources from Mythopia</ActivityItem>, and I'll see about bestowing some god-like powers on your Pickaxe.
?
Hades_022_f0Out of the pure goodness of my heart, of course.

Hades_023_fSure, on it!
a
Hades_012_fRHello? God here. Literally the lord of the Underworld and you want me to... clean?
y
