?
Player_000_choice_000_f$I was just coming to talk about him!

Player_000_choice_001_fOh no... What did he do?
2
Player_000_choice_002_fDid he try to eat you?!
,

Remy_003_fThen, you've got great timing.
I

Remy_005_f;Scar has been a TERRIBLE customer in the restaurant lately.
u

Remy_006_fgHe keeps ordering a dish, eating most of it, and then sending the last bite back saying it was no good.
1
Player_001_choice_000_fUnacceptable behavior!
/
Player_001_choice_001_fDid you talk to him?
C
Player_001_choice_002_f(Isn't it "the customer is always right"?
-

Remy_008_fThat's not even the worst part!
¨

Remy_011_fùI tried to talk to him. I told him I don't mind cooking food for him ‚Äî everyone needs to eat! But complaining just so you don't have to pay is pretty rude.
d

Remy_012_fVHis exact words were, "And what will a mere rodent like you do against a mighty king?"
R

Remy_013_fDThen he knocked his plate onto the floor. It shattered, and he left.

Player_002_choice_000_fI'll report this back to Mushu.

Player_002_choice_001_fScar knows how to make an exit!
C

Remy_015_f5He was worried Scar was picking on smaller Villagers.
K

Remy_016_f=Don't worry, Remy. We'll find a way to get Scar to stop this.
,

Remy_014_f*sigh* Tell that to my dishes.

Remy_007_fQThe first couple of times I didn't do anything... but the fifth time it happened?
^

Remy_009_fPSure. But the full quote is: "The customer is always right in matters of taste."
h

Remy_010_fZAnd I'm pretty sure Scar liked the taste of the food plenty... He just didn't want to pay.

Remy_002_fNothing truly evil, but...
B

Remy_004_f4What? No. No... You scared him off of that, I think.
