Elsa_000_fD{PlayerName}, I've seen what's going on in the sky over the Village.
B

Elsa_003_f4If there's any way I can help, you only have to ask.
O
Player_000_choice_000_f4Maybe you can make an ice shield around the Village?
R
Player_000_choice_001_f7Just keep being you, Elsa. That's all the help we need.
B
Player_000_choice_002_f'I don't even know how to help myself...
>

Elsa_022_f0If it comes to that, I'm certainly happy to try.
E

Elsa_004_f7Well... I know there's one way you can definitely help.
"

Elsa_005_fTake a look at this.
$

Elsa_006_fDoes it look familiar?
H

Elsa_007_f:Oh... It... it does look familiar... from a long time ago.
Y

Elsa_008_fKWe think it belonged to the Forgotten. We need to know the story behind it.
]

Elsa_001_fOI wish I could remember. But it's like there's a mist over my memories of it...
R

Elsa_009_fDThat's the Forgetting. Try to focus. Maybe you can fight through it.
q

Elsa_011_fcIt's so strange. When I look at you... and when I think of the adventures we've gone on together...
8

Elsa_012_f*It feels like it's only just out of reach.
ê

Elsa_013_fÅOur friendship... It might be strong enough to bring back your memories. Maybe we just need to spend a little more time together.
J

Elsa_014_f<It's worth a try. And I always enjoy spending time with you.
i

Elsa_002_f[It's funny. Just a second ago, it was like my memories of this were covered over by a mist.
x

Elsa_010_fjBut then... I looked at you, and I thought of our friendship, and the adventures we've gone on together...
5

Elsa_015_f'And I remembered... I gave this to you.
W

Elsa_016_fIYou were just a child then. You wanted to explore the Ice Cavern with me.
Z

Elsa_017_fLBut it was so cold in there. So I brought you my favorite blanket from home.
”

Elsa_018_fƒAnd when the Forgotten split off... well, I guess they held onto it until they dropped it in the secret chamber. I wish I could remember this. But I guess the Forgotten has some of those memories.
c

Elsa_019_fUWell, I hope you can help pull the Forgotten back from the edge before it's too late.


Elsa_020_fqAnd if you do manage to bring them back... well, maybe I can talk with them. I know what it's like to go too far.
t

Elsa_021_ffThanks, Elsa. That's all I need for now. The magic coming off of the blanket seems stronger already...
s

Elsa_023_feThat's nice of you to say. But I just... I can't stand by and watch the Village come apart around us.

Elsa_024_f&We'll figure this out. We always have.
