(
JackSkellington_011_fSo what's next?
B

e
JackSkellington_013_fLNormally I'd borrow tools from Dr. Finkelstein, but that's not possible now.
f
JackSkellington_000_fMWhat about the stuff here? You've got flasks, a mortar and pestle, potions...
U
JackSkellington_001_f<Oh, I'll most certainly make good use of the equipment here!
w
JackSkellington_009_f^But for the experiments I'm planning, I'll need equipment made to certain physical tolerances.
s
JackSkellington_019_fZI wouldn't want anything exploding on me because I used the wrong type of glass container!

Player_003_choice_000_f
Coooooool.
C
Player_003_choice_001_f(I'm starting to regret agreeing to this.

R
JackSkellington_014_f9Well, good thing I'm a crafting genius! What do you need?

JackSkellington_018_f”Brilliant! I'm off to see Merlin now â€” I hear he has a mind for magic, and I could use an expert's introduction to the arcane forces at work here.
C
JackSkellington_021_f*Nonsense! I picked this spot for a reason!
