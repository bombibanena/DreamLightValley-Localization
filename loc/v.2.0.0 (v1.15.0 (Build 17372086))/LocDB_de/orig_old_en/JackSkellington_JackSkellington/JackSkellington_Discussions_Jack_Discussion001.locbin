JackSkellington_000_fO{PlayerName}, I've been considering recruiting new fright-makers for Halloween.
W
JackSkellington_001_f>Do any of our Valley friends strike you as particularly scary?
(
Player_000_choice_000_fMaybe Merlin?
-
Player_000_choice_001_fDefinitely Ursula.
,
Player_000_choice_002_fWhat about Goofy?
p
JackSkellington_002_fWMerlin? Oh, he's not scary at all! Though, I do think he has other Halloween potential.
D
JackSkellington_003_f+Consider the special effects he could make!
X
JackSkellington_004_f?Oh, so sort of a behind-the-scenes support staff kind of thing?
!
JackSkellington_005_fExactly!
9
JackSkellington_006_f Well, good luck with the search!
W
JackSkellington_007_f>A witch? That's perfect! And she has such a majestic presence.
`
JackSkellington_008_fGOh... but she'll likely want something in exchange for working with us.
d
JackSkellington_009_fKTrue, I guess you'd want someone who's in it for the joy of scaring people.
3
JackSkellington_010_fOh, but he's so endearing!
W
JackSkellington_011_f>Though I am occasionally afraid he'll trip and hurt himself...
S
JackSkellington_012_f:...but that's not really the sort of fear I'm looking for.

JackSkellington_013_fFair!
