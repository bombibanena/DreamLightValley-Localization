b
JackSkellington_005_fIYeah, about that... What final little modifications did you make to them?
Å
JackSkellington_006_fhWell, after some careful experimentation, I was able to extract some magic from the small Night Thorn...
Y
JackSkellington_007_f@Hey, I thought I told you not to mess with Dark Magic like that!
æ
JackSkellington_008_f§Oh, don't worry, {PlayerName}! Thanks to your efforts with Merlin's potion, my Night Thorn isn't evil anymore! Perhaps a little mischievous, but certainly not evil.

JackSkellington_017_fcI'll leave the specifics of the decorations up to you, but I'd suggest you use the following theme.

JackSkellington_018_f÷<ActivityItem>Orange</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Black</ActivityItem> decorations and furnishings with an emphasis on things you might classify as <ActivityItem>Quirky</ActivityItem>. We'll also need lighting.
