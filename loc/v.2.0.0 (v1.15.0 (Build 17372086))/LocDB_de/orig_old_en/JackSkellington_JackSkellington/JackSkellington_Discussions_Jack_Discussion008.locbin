JackSkellington_002_fDI recite chilling lines from various plays. Ahem â€” let me begin...
ƒ
JackSkellington_003_fj"IÂ couldÂ aÂ taleÂ unfoldÂ whoseÂ lightestÂ word
WouldÂ harrowÂ upÂ thyÂ soul,
FreezeÂ thyÂ youngÂ blood,
ç
JackSkellington_004_fÍMakeÂ thyÂ twoÂ eyes,Â likeÂ stars,Â startÂ fromÂ their spheres
ThyÂ knottedÂ andÂ combinedÂ locksÂ toÂ part,
AndÂ eachÂ particularÂ hairÂ toÂ standÂ onÂ end,
LikeÂ quillsÂ uponÂ theÂ fearfulÂ porpentine!"
5
Player_001_choice_000_fCool, but I gotta run now.
&
Player_001_choice_001_fKeep going!
6
JackSkellington_005_fFare thee well, {PlayerName}!
’
JackSkellington_006_fy"Double, double toil and trouble,
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake.
š
JackSkellington_007_f€Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing!"
4
Player_002_choice_000_fOK, that's enough for me.
 
Player_002_choice_001_fMore!
J
JackSkellington_008_f1"Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
J
JackSkellington_009_f1The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
L
JackSkellington_010_f3And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves!"

M
JackSkellington_012_f4And now I shall customize one for our dear Valley...
z
JackSkellington_013_fa"Alas, poor Mickey!
I knew him, {PlayerName}: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
‘
JackSkellington_014_fxWhere be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar?"
$
JackSkellington_015_fAlas! Alas!
.
Player_004_choice_000_fThat was wonderful!
