Merlin_004_f.Now, let's see... Ah, a book of fairy tales...
â
Merlin_005_fyOh dear, it's positively saturated with Dark Magic. It must have been the Forgotten's once. There's no other explanation.
P
Merlin_006_f@We've got something that belonged to the Forgotten. What's next?
}
Merlin_009_fmI'm afraid for this enchantment; we'll need at least <Lore>three more Forgotten Relics</Lore> just like this.

Player_000_choice_000_f"Will they look just like this one?

Player_000_choice_001_fWhere do I find them?
B
Player_000_choice_002_f'Sounds like a wild goose chase to me...
®
Merlin_015_fóWell, some might be quite special, but others could be more mundane. However, they'll all have Dark Magic emanating from them, just like this one does.
£
Merlin_018_fíTo find them, you must keep an eye out for more places where Dark Magic is bleeding through into our world. They could be anywhere in the Village.
W
Merlin_025_fGGot it. Find the <ActivityItem>Relics</ActivityItem>, save the Village.
u
Merlin_008_feAh! Ah! That's not all. We also must obtain the story behind each <ActivityItem>Relic</ActivityItem>.
Å
Merlin_014_fqStories hold a magic all their own, {PlayerName}. Uncover the stories... and you'll be able to harness the magic.
¥
Merlin_010_f£You must discover why these things were of such importance to the Forgotten. You found the first one in Mickey's House. Perhaps Mickey knows the story behind it...
c
Merlin_027_fSI'll <Lore>look around the Village... and go talk to Mickey</Lore>. Thanks, Merlin.

Merlin_017_fÉYou must keep an eye out for more places where Dark Magic is seeping through into our world. They could be anywhere in the Village.
ª
Merlin_019_f™Some of the <ActivityItem>Relics</ActivityItem> might be quite special. Others more mundane. But they'll all have Dark Magic emanating from them, just like this one does.

Merlin_021_f4How am I supposed to even know what I'm looking for?
