Rapunzel_000_fDo you see it? It's so... odd.
{
Rapunzel_001_fiBlack and white can be wonderful for sketches. But when the whole Isle starts turning black and white...?
_
Rapunzel_002_fMIt's like having a big white canvas and only one color of paint to use on it.
<
Player_000_choice_000_f!I think the rifts are kinda cool.
I
Player_000_choice_001_f.You really do think like a painter, don't you?
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$Don't worry. We'll fix it. Together.
 
Rapunzel_003_fOh, don't get me wrong â€” they're fascinating. I just don't want any more to open. What if people or animals start getting sucked into them?
T
Rapunzel_004_fBThat's what I'm hoping to stop. With the help of your imagination.

Rapunzel_005_fI'm not sure I understand.

Rapunzel_006_fjYou and I need to MAKE something together. Something using our creativity. And then toss it into the rift.

Rapunzel_007_f‡The Spark's magic runs on imagination. So, if we can just do that... we can turn the power of the Spark back around and close the rift.

Rapunzel_008_fOh... Okay! Got it!
€
Rapunzel_009_fnOnly... now that you've asked me to think of something creative... all of a sudden, I can't think of anything!
H
Player_001_choice_000_f-Just grit your teeth and focus really hard...
T
Player_001_choice_001_f9Try thinking nonsense until something creative comes out!
[
Player_001_choice_002_f@What if I try to scare you?! Oh, wait. That's for the hiccups...
.
Rapunzel_010_fRight. Okay... I'm focusing!

Rapunzel_011_fGrr! Creativity! Imagination!

Player_002_choice_001_fI don't think this is working.

Rapunzel_012_fUgh! Nothing's happening.
g
Rapunzel_013_fUWhoa. Wait. The second I stopped thinking about it so hard... I thought of something!

Rapunzel_014_fiWhen Mother had me locked in my tower, once a year I would look out and see these lights in the distance.

Rapunzel_015_fKI'd love to build a <ActivityItem>Floating Lantern</ActivityItem> with you!
w
Rapunzel_016_feThat sounds great! Why don't you start drawing up some designs while I find all the stuff we'll need?
~
Rapunzel_017_flThat sounds perfect! I think we'll need some <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood, Bamboo, and Rope</ActivityItem>...

Rapunzel_021_f%It's worth a try! Go ahead: Scare me.

Player_004_choice_000_fBOO!

Player_004_choice_001_f-Checking your work email while on vacation!!!
q
Rapunzel_022_f_Oh, nice job on that "boo," {PlayerName}. But I was expecting it, so it didn't really scare me.
~
Rapunzel_023_flHuh... that's funny. While I was waiting for you to scare me, my thoughts started flowing and I got an idea!
"
Rapunzel_024_fWhat's an email?
y
Rapunzel_025_fgIt's kind of like mail except... You know what, forget it. Maybe that's more scary for me than for you.
[
Rapunzel_026_fII guess I do. That is a pretty painter-y way to think about it, isn't it?
h
Rapunzel_027_fVAnd that's exactly what we need to close this rift. Your creativity. Your imagination!
-
Rapunzel_028_fI know we will. But... how?

Rapunzel_029_f!With your imagination, of course!
