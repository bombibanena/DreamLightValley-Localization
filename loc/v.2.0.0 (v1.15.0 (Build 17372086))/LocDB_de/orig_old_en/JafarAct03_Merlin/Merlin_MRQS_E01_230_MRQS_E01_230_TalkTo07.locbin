Merlin_000_fDrat! When did this appear?!
|
Merlin_001_flThe <Lore>secret entrance to the palace</Lore> is an old cellar door tucked away right here in the Lagoon...
V
Merlin_002_fF...but now this... this <Lore>rift in time</Lore> has blocked the way!
8
Player_000_choice_000_fMaybe there's another way in?
;
Player_000_choice_001_f How do we get rid of this thing?
1
Player_000_choice_002_fARRRGGGHHH! Not again.
Õ
Merlin_003_fºI'm afraid there isn't. I've already investigated teleportation, making you permeable so you could walk through the walls, disguising you as a statue and offering you to Jafar as a gift...
*
Merlin_012_f...using your imagination.
9
Player_001_choice_000_fNo problem! I'm great at that!
5
Player_001_choice_001_fI think I can manage that.
=
Player_001_choice_002_f"Uh-oh. I'm not very imaginative...
J
Merlin_004_f:...but Jafar has mounted defenses against all of my plans.
^
Merlin_005_fNIt will be tricky, but we must <Lore>heal this rift in time</Lore> to proceed.
-
Merlin_006_fGot it. So how do we do that?
s
Merlin_007_fcI deduce that all the rifts across the Isle are connected to one another. And to the Spark's magic.
É
Merlin_008_fsTherefore, if we <Lore>close some of the other rifts</Lore>, we might be able to weaken this one enough to seal it.
B
Merlin_009_f2How do we close the rifts? Can I use my Hourglass?
≤
Merlin_010_f°Unfortunately not. For this, we need a different sort of magic. Something that will allow us to tap into the power of the Spark itself and turn it back on Jafar.
]
Merlin_011_fMI've done some research, and it seems that the key to the Spark's power is...
^
Merlin_013_fNYes, but I fear even for one as imaginative as you, some help might be needed.
A
Merlin_014_f1I suggest you <Lore>seek help from Oswald</Lore>.
&
Player_002_choice_000_fWhy Oswald?
@
Player_002_choice_001_f%Got it. I'll go get help from Oswald.
X
Merlin_015_fHWell, I've spent some time studying the fellow. He is quite fascinating.
5
Merlin_024_f%Got it. I'll go get help from Oswald.
á
Merlin_025_fwYes, and hurry, {PlayerName}! <Lore>Seek help from Oswald</Lore> so you can close the rifts and get us into the palace!
h
Merlin_016_fXYou see, before any of us were here in Dreamlight Valley, this place belonged to others.
ã
Merlin_017_f{In the same way that the Valley now shapes itself around <i>your</i> hopes, <i>your</i> dreams, and <i>your</i> memories...
f
Merlin_018_fV...once upon a time, it belonged to someone else, and Oswald was very special to them.
†
Merlin_019_fèI'm sure there are stories you cherish that were passed down from a trusted loved one. Well, Oswald is a bit like those stories... passed down.
-
Merlin_020_fSo how does that help us now?
{
Merlin_021_fkWell, Oswald surely must have wisdom from seeing the ways that Dreamlight Valley and the Isle have changed.
^
Merlin_022_fNAnd if not, then perhaps he can give you a lesson in utilizing your ingenuity.
Ü
Merlin_023_fvRegardless... Things, er, well, heh, they do just seem to have a way of working out when Oswald is around, don't they?
i
Merlin_026_fYNonsense! You're much more imaginative than you think, {PlayerName}. I've seen it myself.
H
Merlin_027_f8But nonetheless, I fear you'll need some help with this.
U
Merlin_028_fEWe mustn't get discouraged. Jafar is counting on us simply giving up.
