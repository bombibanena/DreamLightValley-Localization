Merlin_001_f2Hey Merlin, can we talk about the Jafar situation?
T
Merlin_002_fDWhy of course, {PlayerName}! How did his community service progress?
.
Merlin_003_fUhh, ups and downs, I suppose.
y
Merlin_004_fiI feel like it inspired memories of his ambition and greed just as much as it inspired positive emotions.
.
Merlin_005_fOh, that is a quandary indeed.
è
Merlin_006_fBut on the other hand, I spoke with some of the other Villagers, and it seems that Jafar has actually been really nice to them.
í
Merlin_007_fÅNot only is he giving gifts, but he's giving gifts that seem to suggest that he's trying to make a connection with the Villagers.
p
Merlin_018_f`How marvelous! Still... I worry that it may be a ruse to ensure his freedom to continue to plot.
#
Player_000_choice_000_fI agree.
(
Player_000_choice_001_fI hope not...
g
Merlin_000_fWBut we can't assume anything for now. We need to go by his actions, not our suspicions.
(
Merlin_027_fPerfect! Thanks, Merlin.
d
Merlin_019_fTSo, I was thinking ‚Äî we should show him that we appreciate the effort he's making.
k
Merlin_020_f[I quite agree, {PlayerName}. You don't lead someone to goodness through constant reprimand.
ù
Merlin_021_fåYeah! I'm going to decorate around the palace with Jafar's favorite aesthetics, but I think we need something else with a little wow factor.
4
Merlin_022_f$Ah... I think I know just the thing!
}
Merlin_026_fmThere you are, {PlayerName} ‚Äî that Iago-inspired centerpiece should remind Jafar of his previous companion.
q
Merlin_024_faWow, great idea! Jafar plays his cards close to his chest, but I think that he kinda misses Iago.
d
Merlin_008_fTWell, I hope a memory of a good friend will continue to inspire him toward goodness.
