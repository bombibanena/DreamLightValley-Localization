Flynn_007_fUFlynn! When I used my magic on the source of the curse inside the Fairy Tale Trial...
R
Player_001_choice_000_f7I need to get to Maleficent to save the Storybook Vale.
?
Player_001_choice_002_f$Come on. You're not scared, are you?
y
Flynn_008_fjI heard this rumbling. It looks like a <Lore>beanstalk</Lore> started to grow towards Maleficent's castle.
‰
Flynn_020_fzIf we <Lore>find more Fairy Tale Trials</Lore>, maybe the beanstalk will grow big enough for us to climb up to the castle!
r
Flynn_009_fcHuh. Giant beanstalk. Well, that would be an EXCELLENT method of entry when trying to rob a castle.
Z
Flynn_010_fKTrust me; in my thieving days, I learned you can climb all sorts of things.
(
Flynn_011_fTrellises, ropes, hair...
B
Flynn_012_f3... Wait a second. Did you say Maleficent's castle?
B
Flynn_013_f3You want me to climb back INTO Maleficent's castle?
,
Flynn_014_fOne small question. ... WHY?!
G
Flynn_015_f8Well, that's very noble of you. Just a little warning...
R
Flynn_018_fCThe last time I got near Maleficent, I wound up with a curse on me.
N
Flynn_019_f?If you're not careful, you're gonna be howling at the moon too.
\
Flynn_002_fMSpeaking of that curse, I'm almost feeling back to my charming, roguish self.

Player_000_choice_000_f#Anything else I can do to help you?
9
Player_000_choice_001_fAlmost? What more do you need?
;
Player_000_choice_002_f No lasting wolfish side effects?
H
Flynn_003_f9It would be nice to have a place to relax while I'm here.
|
Flynn_006_fmThat makes sense. I'll put down some foundations and talk to Mr. McDuck about getting a place set up for you!
u
Flynn_004_ffI wouldn't say that. I keep getting this urge to lift up my back leg to scratch myself behind the ear.

Flynn_005_f*But mostly, I just really want my own den.
?
Flynn_016_f0Deliberately challenging Maleficent isn't brave.
G
Flynn_017_f8It's foolish with an extra helping of ridiculous on top!
