Flynn_002_flThat last Fairy Tale Trial... It was kind of incredible to live out one of those adventures I read as a kid.
R
Player_000_choice_000_f7You're a cooler hero than any hero from a story, Flynn.
E
Player_000_choice_001_f*Nobody's as cool as the heroes in stories.
E
Player_000_choice_002_f*I'm way cooler than the hero in any story.

Flynn_004_fReally...? You think so?
,
Flynn_018_fUh... I mean, of course I am!
(
Flynn_019_f... Thanks, {PlayerName}.
}
Flynn_006_fnIn any case, I did some scouting, and it looks like that beanstalk to Maleficent's castle just grew some more!
p
Flynn_007_faWhich means it's long enough now for us to <Lore>climb it</Lore> to get into Maleficent's castle.
@
Flynn_008_f1You already cleared all the ink blocking the way.
j
Flynn_009_f[Guess all that's left to do is head inside and... well... <Lore>confront Maleficent</Lore>.
>
Flynn_010_f/Whatever happens... I'm with you, {PlayerName}.
M
Flynn_011_f>But first, you'll have to clear all that ink blocking the way.
o
Flynn_012_f`Once you do that, there won't be anything stopping you from <Lore>confronting Maleficent</Lore>.
}
Flynn_013_fnIt looks like we still have to <Lore>find one more Fairy Tale Trial</Lore> before we can climb all the way up.
R
Flynn_014_fCMaybe we could <Lore>look into the Teapot Falls</Lore> to the east?
a
Flynn_015_fRYou'll have to <Lore>clear away all the ink</Lore> around the place first, though.
ˆ
Flynn_016_fyYou already cleared away the ink blocking <Lore>Teapot Falls</Lore>. Let's go look around there for the Fairy Tale Trial.
J
Flynn_017_f;I don't know, {PlayerName}. The two of us are pretty close.
[
Flynn_020_fLYou know, after seeing you in action, I've gotta admit... You're not so bad.

Flynn_021_f†Maybe someday kids in an orphanage will gather around and read "The Tales of {PlayerName}." You can inspire some kid to become a hero.
