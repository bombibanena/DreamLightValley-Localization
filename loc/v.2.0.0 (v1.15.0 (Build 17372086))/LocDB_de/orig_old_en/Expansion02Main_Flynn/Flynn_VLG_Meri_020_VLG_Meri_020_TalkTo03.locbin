Flynn_000_f4Oh, hey, {PlayerName}! Just who I was hoping to see.
]
Flynn_001_fNI was wondering if maybe you could help me smooth something over with someone.
©
Flynn_002_f™I was trying to be helpful. You know, share some of the skills I've learned along the way. But Merida... Well, let's just say, that's not how she saw it.
W
Player_000_choice_000_f<Merida's a world-class archer. She doesn't need your advice.
S
Player_000_choice_001_f8It came from a good place, but it was a bit thoughtless.
\
Player_000_choice_002_fAYou shouldn't have assumed, and she could have handled it better.
k
Flynn_006_f\I know that now! But I didn't when I tried to help her. Still, it was wrong of me to assume.

Flynn_003_f"But Merida didn't just yell at me.
`
Flynn_004_fQShe found my collection of wanted posters and tacked them up all around my House.

Flynn_005_f~She knows how much it bothers me that none of them get my nose right. Now I have to see them all, every time I leave my House!
,
Player_001_choice_000_fServes you right.
.
Player_001_choice_001_fMerida would never!

Player_001_choice_002_fThat wasn't cool of her.
M
Flynn_010_f>Go ahead. Laugh it up. I promise I've learned my lesson. So...
n
Flynn_013_f_If you see any of those posters around my House, could you <Lore>help me take them down</Lore>?
’
Flynn_014_f‚And hey, if you see Merida again... tell her I'm sorry. I never meant to offend her. And next time, I'll keep my advice to myself.
:
Flynn_011_f+Oh, she would. Go take a look for yourself.
W
Flynn_012_fHTHANK you! Though I have to give her credit; it was a pretty good prank.

Flynn_007_fI get that now.

Flynn_008_fYou don't know the half of it.
