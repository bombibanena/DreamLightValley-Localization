Flynn_001_f6Well, the Snippet problem should be taken care of now.
o
Flynn_002_f`I placed some repellent near your House. Those Frog Snippets shouldn't be bothering you anymore.

Flynn_000_f"You are a LIFESAVER, {PlayerName}!
*
Player_000_choice_000_fIt was nothing!
C
Player_000_choice_001_f(I had a little help from the Lorekeeper.

Player_000_choice_002_fI am pretty amazing, aren't I?
(
Flynn_003_fTo you, maybe. But to me?
O
Flynn_006_f@Anything that makes me feel a little more like myself is just...
n
Flynn_009_f_...indescribable. I can't tell you how creepy it is not to recognize who you see in the mirror.
@
Flynn_010_f1I'm so glad I could help. Anything else you need?
l
Flynn_011_f]Well, since you're here... while I was at my peak wolfishness, I developed another bad habit.

Flynn_012_fMeaning...?
K
Flynn_013_f<Apparently, I started burying things. Other people's things.
5
Player_001_choice_000_fThat actually makes sense.
1
Player_001_choice_001_fOof, that's not great.
>
Player_001_choice_002_f#You didn't bury MY things, did you?
T
Flynn_014_fEYou thought you were a wolf; burying things is almost to be expected.
2
Flynn_017_f#That's really understanding of you.
<
Flynn_018_f-You couldn't control yourself; remember that.
*
Flynn_025_fTrue. But that's no excuse.
®
Flynn_027_fžAnyway... I'm pretty sure I buried some of the things outside my House. Think you could find <Lore>those for me and help figure out who they belong to</Lore>?
’
Flynn_028_f‚I can handle that. You should stay here in case anyone comes around looking for their stuff. You can reassure them that I'm on it!
H
Flynn_015_f9You basically stole from people and then hid their stuff.
/
Flynn_019_f I know, I know! I feel terrible.
Y
Flynn_020_fJAll we have to do is find and return everything, and no one will be upset.
5
Flynn_021_f&You weren't yourself under that curse.
4
Flynn_016_f%No, I didn't touch any of your stuff.

Flynn_022_fWhew!
V
Flynn_023_fGBut I took things from other friends. GOOD folks who didn't deserve it.
:
Flynn_024_f+You didn't know what you were doing, Flynn.
;
Flynn_004_f,That's great, but don't sell yourself short.
R
Flynn_007_fCThanks to you, I feel a little more like myself, and that's just...
2
Flynn_005_f#You are! You really saved me today.
L
Flynn_008_f=And now I'm starting to feel more like ME, and that's just...
