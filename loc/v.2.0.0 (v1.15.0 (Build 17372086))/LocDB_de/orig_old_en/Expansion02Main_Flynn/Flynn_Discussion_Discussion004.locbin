Flynn_000_fKHey, quick question. If you had to choose, which name do you like better...
4
Flynn_001_f%...Flynn Rider or Eugene Fitzherbert?
!
Player_000_choice_000_fFlynn.
"
Player_000_choice_001_fEugene.
,
Player_000_choice_002_fI like them both!
H
Flynn_002_f9I know, right? It's more interesting, daring, exciting...
U
Flynn_003_fFEugene's boring. Who'd want to be named that? Not me, that's for sure.
b
Flynn_004_fSReally? You think "Eugene" is better than "Flynn Rider"? Isn't it kind of... bland?
'
Player_001_choice_000_fIt's unique!
,
Player_001_choice_001_fIt's interesting.
_
Flynn_005_fPSo you think "Eugene Fitzherbert" is a more interesting name than "Flynn Rider"?
9
Flynn_006_f*Well, you're the second one to think that.
#
Flynn_007_fYou really think so?
G
Flynn_008_f8I... well, guess I've got something to think about then.
c
Flynn_009_fTReally? How can you not have an opinion on this? They're completely different names.
q
Flynn_010_fbOr maybe... you're saying that it's not the name that's important, but the person behind the name?
#
Player_002_choice_000_fExactly.
/
Player_002_choice_001_fI'm just indecisive.
4
Flynn_011_f%Huh... I'll have to think about that.
[
Flynn_012_fLHey, totally fair. I, for one, never make decisive choices if I can help it.
