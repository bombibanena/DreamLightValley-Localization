

O

Olaf_003_fAI have a trivia fact about the word "great"... but... never mind.
2

Olaf_006_f$You don't want to share a fun fact?!
/
Player_000_choice_001_fOlaf, what's wrong?!
D
Player_000_choice_002_f)What happened to my cheerful friend Olaf?
l
Player_000_choice_003_fQA snowman that's lost his excitement for trivia has lost his excitement for life!


Olaf_004_fUmm...

Olaf_008_fIt was earlier today...
º

Olaf_009_f«Remy brought me some INCREDIBLE <Lore>Chocolate Ice Cream</Lore> that I wanted to give to Anna as a surprise for Best Friends Forever Day... which I invented this morning.
8

Olaf_010_f*And then... something disturbing happened.
a

Olaf_027_fSI may not be mature yet, but I think even someone mature would have been disturbed.
h

Olaf_011_fZMr. Skellington kept saying "what's this?" and poking the ice cream with his bony fingers!
0
Player_001_choice_000_fOhh, that's terrible!
@
Player_001_choice_001_f%I think he was just curious about it?
>
Player_001_choice_002_f#I can't lie â€” that's kinda funny.
m

Olaf_013_f_Oh, thank goodness! I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks fingers don't belong in ice cream.
>
Player_002_choice_000_f#Thank you, I appreciate that, Olaf.
(
Player_002_choice_001_fYou're great.
a

Olaf_018_fSDon't worry, Olaf; I'll make you a fresh batch of <Lore>Chocolate Ice Cream</Lore>.
f

Olaf_019_fXAnd I'll have a word with Jack Skellington about barging into people's houses like that.

Olaf_020_f%Thank you! Oh, here! Have the recipe.
"

Olaf_028_fAnd... {PlayerName}?


Olaf_021_f
Yes, Olaf?
@

Olaf_022_f2I could never keep a fun piece of trivia from you.
e

Olaf_023_fWDid you know that before it was a synonym for "excellent," "great" first meant "large"?
›

Olaf_024_fŒI'll get right on making you some <ActivityItem>Chocolate Ice Cream</ActivityItem> so you have a Best Friends Forever Day surprise for Anna.
å

Olaf_025_fÖIn the modern sense, but also the old sense to refer to your great heart. I'll get right on making you some <ActivityItem>Chocolate Ice Cream</ActivityItem> so you have a Best Friends Forever Day surprise for Anna.
O

Olaf_014_fAOh... But, {PlayerName}, I'm curious about lots of things, too...
~

Olaf_015_fp...and I try not to let my curiosity ruin other people's first-ever Best Friends Forever Day ice cream surprise.
r

Olaf_016_fdIt is? But it ruined my surprise for Anna. Is this a kind of humor I'm not old enough to understand?
[

Olaf_017_fMNo. It's not that. I guess it's just Jack Skellington being Jack Skellington.
2

Olaf_005_f$Well... Jack Skellington visited me.
>

Olaf_012_f0Oh, I could never lose my excitement for trivia.

Olaf_026_f'But I am having not-excited feelings...
