Buzz_000_fCHey Buzz... you told me you got knocked out the window once, right?
Q

Buzz_001_fCIt was an unpleasant incident I'd rather forget, but... yes, I did.
G

Buzz_002_f9Would you say that felt a bit like being unfairly exiled?

Buzz_003_f("Exiled" is a strong word, Space Ranger.
=

Buzz_004_f/I prefer to think of it as a misguided mistake.
è

Buzz_005_fÄI'm trying to find someone who was unfairly exiled to help the Forgotten with a poem. Sounds like you're not the right Villager.
?
Player_000_choice_000_f$Do you want to give it a try anyway?

Player_000_choice_001_fSee you around!

Buzz_006_fTPoetry is not exactly my forte. But I'll do whatever I can to assist. Let's hear it.

Buzz_007_f-Here's what the Forgotten's written so far...
J

Buzz_008_f<<Lore>It seems there's no place I will ever belong...</Lore>
J

Buzz_009_f<<Lore>And all of my words seem to come out all wrong.</Lore>
O

Buzz_010_fA<Lore>But I'll wait for an answer, I'll wait for a sign...</Lore>

Buzz_011_frHmm... That is a fine problem. Those lines really shine, but I just can't think of a word that rhymes with "sign."
b

Buzz_012_fTWish I could be of assistance... Guess I'm better at playing Space Ranger than poet.
g

Buzz_013_fYFor now, I'll just have to keep looking for <Lore>someone who was unfairly exiled</Lore>.
a

Buzz_014_fSOf course. But if the Forgotten ever needs help organizing playtime, that I can do.
