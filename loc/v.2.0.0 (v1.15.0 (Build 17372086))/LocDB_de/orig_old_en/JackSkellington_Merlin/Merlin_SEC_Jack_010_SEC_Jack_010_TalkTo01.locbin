Merlin_001_f]Hey, Merlin... I was wondering if you've noticed anything strange going on around the Valley.
+
Merlin_008_fWill do â€” thanks, Merlin!
&
Merlin_002_fI most certainly have!
Z
Merlin_003_fJThe magical instruments in the Library have been acting quite irregularly!
|
Merlin_004_flThey've registered an influx of magic in the Valley â€” magic that hasn't been felt here in quite some time.
y
Merlin_005_fiDo you think it could have anything to do with this <ActivityItem>Matryoshka Doll</ActivityItem> I found?
n
Merlin_006_f^Hmm... I suppose it's possible. Perhaps someone new is trying to come through into the Valley.
o
Merlin_007_f_They may be having trouble fully manifesting. I highly recommend you investigate all anomalies.
ƒ
Merlin_009_fsIn fact, have you <Lore>surveyed the Forgotten Lands</Lore> recently? My instruments indicated a disturbance there.
E
Merlin_010_f5Perhaps those odd dolls have something to do with it.
