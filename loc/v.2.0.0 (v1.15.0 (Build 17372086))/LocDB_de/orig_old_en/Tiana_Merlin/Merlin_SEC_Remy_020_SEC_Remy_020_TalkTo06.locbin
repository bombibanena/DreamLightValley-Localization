Merlin_001_f*Hey Merlin, can we talk food for a moment?
V
Merlin_002_fFOf course. And what sort of food do you wish to discuss, {PlayerName}?
s
Merlin_003_fcI recently recalled a memory of you sharing a meal with some other Villagers in the Glade of Trust.
¬
Merlin_004_f›It came out of this magical-looking cookbook, and I'm trying to figure out the recipe... I think it might be the key to finding the Villager who cooked it.
W
Merlin_005_fGRemy already confirmed that it needs <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>.
§
Merlin_013_f–I've already spoken with Moana and Mickey. They remembered that the dish had <ActivityItem>Onion</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>.

S
Merlin_008_fCI do recall sharing that dish. It was quite tasty and rather spicy.
c
Merlin_009_fSAhh, so <ActivityItem>Chili Peppers</ActivityItem> are the next Ingredient? Got it!
a
Merlin_010_fQJust a moment, {PlayerName}. That dish wasn't just spicy, it was magically spicy!
m
Merlin_011_f]I had completely forgotten, but luckily the magic in these peppers has preserved them nicely!
O
