Mirabel_000_fjSo, I don't know if you know, but a whole bunch of stuff went down with my family that was kind of a mess.
e
Mirabel_014_fTBut I got them to talk out all the issues we had, and it really brought us together.
u
Mirabel_001_fdWhich is why I wanted to do the same for a family here in the Valley. But... it didn't go very well.
,
Player_000_choice_000_fWhat do you mean?
/
Player_000_choice_001_fI'll help you later.

Mirabel_002_fnYou might've noticed that Mr. McDuck and Donald have been arguing a lot. Like my sister Isabela and I used to.
v
Mirabel_003_feWell, yesterday, I heard them shouting at each other outside Mr. McDuck's Store. And I tried to help.
S
Player_001_choice_000_f8I don't blame you. Somebody needs to sort those two out.
-
Player_001_choice_001_fAnd it went wrong?
S
Player_001_choice_002_f8When it comes to those two... I try not to get involved.

Mirabel_004_f%Exactly! But it didn't actually work.
ò
Mirabel_005_fÜSee, I've found with my family that if we go somewhere quiet and be honest about how we feel, then we can really listen to each other.
f
Mirabel_006_fUSo, I invited Donald and Mr. McDuck to come with me on a walk in the Forest of Valor.
n
Mirabel_015_f]I was hoping some fresh air would help them calm down and hear what the other one was saying.
ì
Mirabel_007_fÅBut nothing went the way I'd hoped. They just talked over each other like they always do. And then Donald tripped on a tree root.
ï
Mirabel_008_fÉHe ended up in the river, and Mr. McDuck got knocked over and lost his <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> to a raccoon.

Mirabel_009_f%Now they're mad at each other AND me.
H
Mirabel_010_f7Oh boy. Let me talk to them. I'll assess the situation.

Mirabel_011_f	So wrong!
C
Mirabel_012_f2Wish I'd had you around to tell me that yesterday.
J
Mirabel_013_f9I get that. Thank you! As soon as you can would be great.
