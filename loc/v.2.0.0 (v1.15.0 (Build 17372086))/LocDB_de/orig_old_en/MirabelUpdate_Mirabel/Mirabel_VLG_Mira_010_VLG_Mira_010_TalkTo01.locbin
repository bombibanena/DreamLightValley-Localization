Mirabel_001_fWWay to look on the bright side, {PlayerName}! But I promise, it was even better before.

Mirabel_002_f>The floor was painted, and the walls were bright and colorful.

Mirabel_003_f€Now, they're just kind of blah. I want to fix them, then repaint them in greens and yellows. Where do you think we should start?
¾
Mirabel_004_f¬Let's start with the basics... We'll need some materials, such as <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Stone</ActivityItem>, to replace the damaged ones.
Â
Mirabel_005_f°As for the pigments, I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Dandelions</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Yellow Daisies</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Green Rising Penstemons</ActivityItem>.

Mirabel_006_fI can get all of that for you.
‹
Mirabel_007_fzThat'd be amazing! Thank you! I'll start thinking about the new patterns I'm gonna paint and getting things ready in here.

Mirabel_008_fRWell... I suppose that's one way of looking at it. But it was really great before.
