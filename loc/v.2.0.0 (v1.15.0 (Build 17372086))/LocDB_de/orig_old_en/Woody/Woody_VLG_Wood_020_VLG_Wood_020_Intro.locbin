Player_000_choice_000_fI can't wait to get started.
)
Player_000_choice_002_fNot right now.

Woody_006_fZGreat! 'Cause I'm gonna need you to do most of the heavy lifting since... well, I'm a toy.
°
Woody_008_fëEverything I've ever fixed up till now could be patched with gum or a little bit of tape, so I have no idea where to start on something this big.

Player_001_fLet's go see Kristoff.
1
Player_001_choice_000_fHe's handy with tools.

Player_001_choice_001_fHe's good at solving problems.
J
Player_001_choice_002_f/He's very practical-minded, which I'm, uh, not.
≠
Woody_000_fùGood idea. I hear he survived in the Forest of Valor when he was trapped by the Night Thorns. He must've learned to make the best of whatever he had on hand.
?
Woody_004_f0Plus, he's always workin' on that Sled of his...

Woody_001_f%Yeah, I have heard he's pretty savvy.

Woody_003_fñAw, don't sell yourself short, {PlayerName}. The Village is proof that you can get just about anything done. And sometimes that means asking for help.
ç
Woody_002_f~And Kristoff must've needed to be pretty practical to survive in the Forest of Valor while he was trapped by the Night Thorns.

Woody_007_f5That's okay. Just come find me whenever you're ready.
