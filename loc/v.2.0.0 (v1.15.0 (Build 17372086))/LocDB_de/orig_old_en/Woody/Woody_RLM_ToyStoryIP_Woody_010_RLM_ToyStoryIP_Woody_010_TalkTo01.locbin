Woody_000_fUAll right, {PlayerName}; if we're gonna rebuild Bonnie's farm just how she left it...
V
Woody_001_fG...we need to start by building a corral where all the cattle can live.
M
Woody_005_f>There's lots of supplies we can use scattered around the room.
J
Woody_025_f;But I don't think we're gonna find everything we need here.
b
Woody_002_fSDon't worry. I sent Buzz on a recon mission. He's going to help us find everything.
C
Woody_003_f4Smart thinking! You sure are making yourself useful.
Y
Woody_006_fJKeep this up and I bet you'll be one of Bonnie's favorite toys in no time.

Player_000_choice_000_fI'm not a toy. But thanks.
L
Player_000_choice_001_f1I mean, obviously she'd love me. I'm so lifelike.
N
Player_000_choice_002_f3But I don't have a cool pull string or voice box...
K
Woody_007_f<Oh no. Not another toy in denial. Okay, listen... You areâ€”
Q
Woody_010_fBUh... forget it. Just tell me what I'll need to fix Bonnie's farm.

Woody_014_f¥Well, you can start by gathering up some of the <ActivityItem>Pipe Cleaners</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Ice Pop Sticks</ActivityItem> scattered around the room.
+
Woody_024_fGreat. I'll go gather those.
t
Woody_015_feOh, and watch out. They seem to be stuck to some candy. And there's a lot of paper on the floor, too.
V
Woody_016_fGDon't worry. My trusty Pickaxe and Shovel should take care of all that.
£
Woody_019_f“Great! Once you've got everything, <Lore>bring it back to me</Lore>. In the meantime, I'll start trying to figure out how to put it all together...

Woody_008_fNAnd you've got all those cool accessories. I bet they're sold separately, huh?

Woody_004_fYep. Courtesy of Mr. McDuck...

Woody_011_fMr. Mc-who?

Woody_009_fLHey, toys don't need a lot of snazzy features to make a kid happy. Trust me.
I
Woody_012_f:You just have to try to do what's best for 'em â€” always.
J
Woody_013_f;Speaking of which... What will I need to fix Bonnie's farm?
