Woody_003_fHThis is it. This is where I almost got dragged into the water by a fish.
p
Woody_001_faYa see, after the whole cooking disaster, I decided to try something simpler. Like home delivery.
Ã
Woody_000_fºGoofy was organizing a dinner with friends. He wanted to make <ActivityItem>Crispy Cod</ActivityItem>, so he needed <ActivityItem>Cod</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>.
ó
Woody_005_fáTurns out herding fish is way harder than herding toy cattle. I cast my line out and, before I knew it, I was waterskiing behind a cod!

Woody_014_f(Huh. I knew there must be a trick to it.
ñ
Woody_007_fÜSo I guess we'll have to fish some <ActivityItem>Cod</ActivityItem> for Goofy. Did you get him the <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>?
T
Woody_008_fEHave you seen the size of those plants? They're twice as big as I am.
ê
Woody_019_fÄI couldn't harvest and carry 'em. Now Goofy hasn't got anything to make his dinner with. If we don't get all this to him soon‚Äî
ñ
Woody_013_fÜDon't worry. I'll show you how it's done. Let's get Goofy his <ActivityItem>Cod</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>!

Woody_017_f,What? Ohhh... Heh-heh. I get it. Very funny.

Woody_018_f/You're startin' to remind me of my friend Hamm.
