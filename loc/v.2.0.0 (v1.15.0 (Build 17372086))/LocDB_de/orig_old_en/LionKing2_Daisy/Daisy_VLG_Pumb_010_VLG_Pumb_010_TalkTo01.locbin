Daisy_000_f&Hey, Daisy! ... Are you mad at Pumbaa?
z
Daisy_002_fkWhat? Why, of course not! Pumbaa's one of the sweetest, gentlest Villagers here. Why would I be mad at him?
J
Daisy_003_f;He said you left as soon as he came into Chez Remy today...
@
Player_000_choice_000_f%You can be honest with me. What's up?
E
Player_000_choice_001_f*He was too embarrassed to ask you himself.
1
Player_000_choice_002_fHe might have anxiety.
^
Daisy_006_fOOh, I would never be ANYTHING but honest. That's called journalistic integrity.
H
Daisy_008_f9To be frank: Pumbaa and Timon both eat like wild animals.
E
Player_001_choice_000_f*They've never been in a restaurant before.
I
Player_001_choice_001_f.Doesn't seem like enough of a reason to leave.

Player_001_choice_002_fThey ARE wild animals!

Daisy_014_flBut manners aside, the real problem was Pumbaa's aroma. When he first got here, it wasn't noticeable at all.
´
Daisy_015_f¤But after he started eating, something changed. He just started smelling like... Well, let's just say it's a smell even my most luxurious perfume couldn't cover up!
w
Daisy_016_fhHm... Elsa said something similar. I better <Lore>ask Remy about this</Lore>. Maybe he has some insight.

Daisy_017_f&That's strange. I wonder what changed.
^
Daisy_018_fOMaybe I'll go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore> and see what she thinks. Thanks, Daisy!

Daisy_010_fMaybe not...

Daisy_012_fOSo are Simba and Nala, but they don't fling food all around them when they eat.
I
Daisy_004_f:Oh, no! Poor thing. I suppose I do owe him an explanation.
l
Daisy_007_f]Poor thing. I'm so glad you're trying to help him feel better. I'll tell you what happened...
