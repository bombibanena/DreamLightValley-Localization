Elsa_002_fSee?


Elsa_008_fNothing.

Elsa_009_fGI think it might be Dreamlight Magic. Do you know how to clear it away?

Player_003_f(Well, I do have a magic Pickaxe handy...

Player_003_choice_000_fI'm sure it'll work.

Player_003_choice_001_fIt's the best tool for this.

Elsa_004_f&I'm glad that you're happy to help me.

Elsa_007_fmNow this ice is very thick. If we were trying to melt it, it would take something as hot as the sun to do so.

Player_002_f–I've spent a lot of time around Merlin. I'm starting to understand how things work around here. You have to embrace the "dream" in "Dreamlight Magic."

Elsa_006_fwThat's an explosive, right? It might collapse the Ice Cavern by accident. Your magic Pickaxe seems like a safer choice.
