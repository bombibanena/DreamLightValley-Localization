Merlin_000_fQHow curious... It seems the other chambers hold the key to opening the trap door.
e
Merlin_004_fUThese must be tests! Tests of the precise qualities this ancient civilization valued.

A
Player_002_choice_002_f&The musical notes in the East Chamber?
p
Merlin_005_f`It is some form of ancient technology. The ancient civilization valued technological innovation.
ƒ
Merlin_006_fsYou'll have to find someone on Eternity Isle who can speak to this contraption. Someone well-versed in such things.

Player_003_choice_000_fEVE?

!
Player_003_choice_002_fGoofy?
v
Merlin_007_ffYes, EVE would be perfect! She spent ages on Eternity Isle, surrounded by all this ancient technology.
.
Merlin_011_fGot it. I'll ask EVE for help.
±
Merlin_031_f There you have it! The ancient civilization must have prized <Lore>strength and heroism, technological know-how and innovation, and creativity and music</Lore>.
w
Merlin_033_fgBut no one person could have embodied all those talents. So perhaps what they valued most of all was...
|
Merlin_034_fl...friendship and collaboration! Which means, no individual can reach the Spark of Imagination on their own.
g
Merlin_032_fWBut with the help of <Lore>Gaston, EVE, and Rapunzel</Lore>, I'm sure you'll get there.
f
Merlin_008_fVWALLÂ·E... Hmm, not a bad suggestion. But someone like EVE might be even more helpful.
[
Merlin_009_fKShe spent ages on Eternity Isle, surrounded by all this ancient technology.
l
Merlin_010_f\Goofy?! Oh, no, no, no! Why, even a fishing rod can become a major malfunction in his hands!
<
Merlin_012_f,Someone like EVE would be much more helpful.
“
Merlin_013_f‚Why, it looks like some sort of podium. I suspect a statue of a pair of great heroes once stood here, but it's long crumbled away.
v
Merlin_025_ffYou must find someone quite hefty to stand on it and trigger it. Someone who can strike a heroic pose.
r
Merlin_014_fbEvidently, this ancient civilization prized strength and heroism. We'll require someone like that.

Player_004_choice_001_fGaston?
)
Player_004_choice_002_fMe, of course!
Î
Merlin_015_f½The idea has merit, but I daresay Maui might be a bit TOO much for this platform. The ancient civilization could not have depended on succeeding generations having a demigod in their midst.
;
Merlin_017_f+Gaston, though... he would do quite nicely.
I
Merlin_022_f9Great. I'll talk to Gaston about how to trigger that one.
5
Merlin_016_f%Brilliant! Gaston should work nicely.
i
Merlin_018_fYWell, you ARE quite heroic, {PlayerName}, but I'm not sure you'll do the trick this time.
\
Merlin_019_fLWe need someone with a thicker neck... and perhaps a stomach full of eggs...

Merlin_020_f... Gaston?
2
Merlin_021_f"Yes! Gaston would do quite nicely.
‡
Merlin_023_fwHmm... It seems the ancient civilization prized creativity, and specifically music as one of the purest creative forms.
^
Merlin_024_fNYou'll have to find someone with a bit of musical know-how to unlock that one.

Merlin_026_fˆI've heard Scrooge croon some fine Scottish folk tunes, but in this case, well... er... I'm not sure he's quite the fellow for the task.
d
Merlin_029_fTPerhaps you could ask Rapunzel? She's a fine singer and also a lovely guitar player.
0
Merlin_030_f Great. I'll go talk to Rapunzel.
t
Merlin_027_fdRemy is an excellent cook, but I think we're in need of someone who can sing and play an instrument.
R
Merlin_028_fBA most astute suggestion. She's a fine singer and instrumentalist!
