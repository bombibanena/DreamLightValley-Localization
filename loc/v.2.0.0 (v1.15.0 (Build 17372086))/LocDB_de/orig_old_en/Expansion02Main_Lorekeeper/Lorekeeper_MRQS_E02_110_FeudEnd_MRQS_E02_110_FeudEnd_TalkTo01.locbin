r
Lorekeeper_003_f^{PlayerName}, did you see what I saw within my pages? Maleficent and Hades share a deep wound.
n
Lorekeeper_005_fZNeither felt welcome at an important gathering. Both took the slight... rather personally.
V
Player_003_choice_000_f;Maleficent wasn't invited to Aurora's honoring celebration.
j
Player_003_choice_001_fOHades didn't feel like anyone wanted him at the celebration of Hercules' birth.
8
Player_003_choice_002_fI don't get why this matters.
N
Lorekeeper_018_f:Precisely. Maleficent cursed Aurora from that day forward.
z
Lorekeeper_019_ffYes, yes. After that ignominious snub, Hades was more determined than ever to overthrow Mount Olympus.
‡
Lorekeeper_020_fsBecause now I remember precisely what led Maleficent and Hades to steal away the Storybook Vale in the first place!
´
Lorekeeper_009_fŸDuring the Forgetting, my old friend Merlin neglected to invite the villainous pair to a great gathering of all the most powerful magic-wielders in the Valley.
:
Lorekeeper_010_f&He meant to, really. He merely forgot.
X
Lorekeeper_011_fDMaleficent and Hades swore revenge for being disrespected once more.
T
Player_000_choice_000_f9THAT'S what this is all about? Those two are SUCH babies.
E
Player_000_choice_001_f*I get it. It feels bad not to be included.
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&I'd probably have done the same thing.
‚
Lorekeeper_006_fnThey are childish, they are petulant, and despite being the Mistress of All Evil and lord of the Underworld...
„
Lorekeeper_007_fp...their feelings are all too human, aren't they? No one likes to be left out. Not even a rather talkative book.
A
Player_001_choice_000_f&I guess I can sort of understand that.
_
Player_001_choice_001_fDNot buying it. Dealing with hurt feelings is part of being grown up.
X
Lorekeeper_021_fDWe need not excuse their actions, only understand their motivations.
b
Lorekeeper_022_fNPerhaps if there was some way to make them both feel important and included...
U
Lorekeeper_023_fASomething with <Lore>fancy invitations</Lore> made just for them?
ƒ
Lorekeeper_028_foYes, yes! Invite them to a great gathering to discuss how we can put a stop to the Neverafter once and for all.
R
Lorekeeper_004_f>We need a name for this endeavor. Something to unite us all...
?
Player_005_choice_000_f$The Grand Council of the Neverafter.
5
Player_005_choice_001_fThe Guardians of the Vale.
3
Player_005_choice_002_fThe Lorekeeper's Legion.
G
Lorekeeper_008_f3Hrm... yes... it sounds quite official, doesn't it?
Z
Lorekeeper_030_fFIt's time to convene the <Lore>Grand Council of the Neverafter</Lore>!
Ÿ
Lorekeeper_029_fŠ{PlayerName}, <Lore>make the invitations and gather everyone</Lore> right here in the Library of Lore. I will prepare a stirring speech...
^
Lorekeeper_012_fJOh, my. How heroic! Maleficent and Hades will feel quite flattered indeed.
Q
Lorekeeper_031_f=It's time to assemble the <Lore>Guardians of the Vale</Lore>!
9
Lorekeeper_032_f%Oh... you'd like to name it after me?
‰
Lorekeeper_033_fuI can't tell you how moved I am, {PlayerName}. Before you arrived, I feared the Vale was doomed to be overrun by ink.
g
Lorekeeper_034_fSIt's an honor to convene the first meeting of the <Lore>Lorekeeper's Legion</Lore>.
Ž
Lorekeeper_013_fzYes, despite being the Mistress of All Evil and the lord of the Underworld, their feelings are all too human, aren't they?
‰
Lorekeeper_014_fuI too can understand the all too human emotions that drove the Mistress of All Evil and the lord of the Underworld...
…
Lorekeeper_015_fq...but are you truly implying that if you weren't invited to a party, you would sow chaos across the entire Vale?
-
Player_002_choice_000_fEr... I guess not.
X
Player_002_choice_001_f=Definitely. I take parties VERY seriously. Parties have cake!
;
Lorekeeper_016_f'Good. I was worried for a moment there.
F
Lorekeeper_025_f2But back to the subject of Maleficent and Hades...
a
Lorekeeper_017_fMHrm. While I cannot eat cake myself, I do enjoy a good description of a cake.
X
Player_004_choice_000_f=A chocolate cake with a layer of extra-rich fondant on top...
Q
Player_004_choice_001_f6A coconut cake that's not too dry and not too gooey...
V
Player_004_choice_002_f;I'll describe cakes to you later. Right now we gotta focus.
%
Lorekeeper_024_fHmmm! Delectable!
_
Lorekeeper_027_fKErrr, but we mustn't get distracted by cakes. Back to Maleficent and Hades!
?
Lorekeeper_026_f+Er, yes, yes. Back to Maleficent and Hades!
