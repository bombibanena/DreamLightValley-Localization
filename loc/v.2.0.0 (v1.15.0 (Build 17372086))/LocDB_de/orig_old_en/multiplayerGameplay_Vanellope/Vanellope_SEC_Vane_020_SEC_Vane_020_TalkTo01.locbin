Vanellope_000_f?Hey, {PlayerName}, you are NOT gonna believe what I just found!
o
Vanellope_001_f\I was spelunking in the deepest, darkest, and most dangerous dungeon in the whole Village...
1
Vanellope_002_f...Scrooge McDuck's storeroom.
B
Player_000_f2You were messing around in Mr. McDuck's storeroom?
O
Player_000_choice_000_f4Sounds scary. Must be a lot of stuff piled in there.
3
Player_000_choice_001_fFind any cool treasures?
>
Player_000_choice_002_f#Does Mr. McDuck know about this...?
4
Vanellope_003_f!Scary? Nah. Exciting? Definitely!
U
Vanellope_010_fBAnd it was SO worth it. Because after a little bit of exploring...
#
Vanellope_009_f...I found THIS!
 
Vanellope_012_fWhat IS this?
¢
Vanellope_013_fŽNo idea. But I think it's connected to that network I was stuck on. There's a label on the side that says "<Lore>Valley Visit Station</Lore>."
’
Vanellope_014_fMaybe if you <Lore>put it somewhere and turn it on</Lore>, it'll let you <Lore>VISIT all those other Valleys</Lore> that I saw!
5
Player_001_choice_000_fHow do I know for sure...?
1
Player_001_choice_001_fThis sounds dangerous.
;
Player_001_choice_002_f Maybe I should talk to Merlin...
H
Vanellope_015_f5Well, there's only one way to know FOR SURE for sure.
†
Vanellope_019_fsFor once in your life, embrace the excitement of pressing a giant button even though you have no CLUE what it does!
h
Vanellope_022_fUJust <Lore>place that thingydoo somewhere in the Valley and try turning it on</Lore>!
k
Vanellope_016_fXQuite possibly. But I'm sure whatever happens, you'll just respawn at the starting line.
P
Vanellope_020_f=I... don't think that's how things work in Dreamlight Valley.
'
Vanellope_021_fC'mon, {PlayerName}!
‚
Vanellope_017_foSeriously, {PlayerName}! Are you gonna go running to Merlin every time something weird and mysterious happens?!
+
Vanellope_018_fWell... I have so far...
H
Vanellope_004_f5Nah, just some rubies, diamonds, and a bunch of gold.
=
Vanellope_005_f*Not even one lousy power-up or extra life.
g
Vanellope_008_fTI was starting to think I'd never find anything REALLY cool, when all of a sudden...
H
Vanellope_006_f5Of course! I told him I wanted to do some organizing.
P
Vanellope_007_f=Only now it's even less organized than it was when I went in.
n
Vanellope_011_f[What can I say? I got distracted by the greatest discovery in the history of discoveries...
