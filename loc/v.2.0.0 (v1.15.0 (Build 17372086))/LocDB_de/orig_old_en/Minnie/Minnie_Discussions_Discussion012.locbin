Minnie_008_f.Ursula? What do you want to talk to her about?
v
Minnie_009_ffWell, I like to be friends with all my neighbors, so I was hoping we could find some things in common.

Minnie_010_f%But I'm not sure she'd be open to it.
B
Player_001_choice_000_f'Talk to her like you would anyone else.
P
Player_001_choice_001_f5She's pretty friendly. Just don't sign any contracts.
F
