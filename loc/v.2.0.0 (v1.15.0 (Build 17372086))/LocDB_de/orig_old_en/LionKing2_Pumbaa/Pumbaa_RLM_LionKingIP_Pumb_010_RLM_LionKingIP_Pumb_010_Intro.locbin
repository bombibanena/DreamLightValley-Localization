Pumbaa_012_f1To relax, first ya have to find a PLACE to relax.

Pumbaa_013_fåSometimes, Timon and I like to make our beds using <ActivityItem>Palm Tree Sap</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Jungle Vines</ActivityItem>.
q
Pumbaa_014_faWe attach the vines to two trees with the sap and then you can lounge in 'em. It's REAL relaxing!
ó
Pumbaa_015_fÜIt sounds like you're talking about a hammock. I'll <Lore>start to look for supplies in the jungle</Lore> to make a hammock of my own.
