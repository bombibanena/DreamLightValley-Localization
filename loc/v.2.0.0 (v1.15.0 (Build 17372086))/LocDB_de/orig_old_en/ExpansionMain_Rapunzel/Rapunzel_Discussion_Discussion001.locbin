Rapunzel_000_fh{PlayerName} ‚Äî I was hoping you could give me some advice. I really want to learn more about Eugene...
K
Rapunzel_001_f9But it seems like talking about his past embarrasses him.
u
Rapunzel_002_fcWhat do you think the best way is to let him know that he doesn't need to be embarrassed around me?
4
Player_000_choice_000_fTell him about YOUR past.
9
Player_000_choice_001_fSay you still think he's cool.
8
Player_000_choice_002_fI think you can just ask him.
ç
Rapunzel_003_f{You know what... That's a great idea! Oh, but what should I tell him? Maybe how I made a pulley system to open the sunroof?
B
Rapunzel_004_f0Or the time I made sixteen papier-m√¢ch√© heads?
8
Player_001_choice_000_fTell the pulley-system story!
>
Player_001_choice_001_f#Tell the papier-m√¢ch√© head story!
4
Player_001_choice_002_fTalk about YOUR feelings.
à
Rapunzel_005_fvOkay! I made it because I was painting murals near the top of the tower, and I wanted to be able to control the light.
ø
Rapunzel_006_f¨It took me quite a few tries, and there were a couple of almost falls and sore thumbs from hammer hits, but I eventually figured it out. And I got pretty good at carpentry.
Ö
Rapunzel_007_fsActually, it's kind of funny. I started out by making one, but the shape wasn't quite right so then I made another.
c
Rapunzel_008_fQBut the face I drew on the second one was pretty crooked, so then I made another.
\
Rapunzel_009_fJThen the paper hair I made on the third one fell apart, so I made another.
h
Rapunzel_010_fVAnd, well, when Mother came home that evening there were sixteen papier-m√¢ch√© heads.
E
Rapunzel_011_f3That's the only time I've ever seen her speechless.
\
Rapunzel_012_fJOh... Okay... Maybe I'll tell him about a time I felt lonely in the tower.
6
Rapunzel_013_f$Ooh, but that's not very cheerful...
:
Player_002_choice_000_fIt doesn't need to be cheerful.
2
Player_002_choice_001_fPick a cheerful memory.
à
Rapunzel_014_fvYou're right. I guess that's the point, really. That everyone has memories that aren't cheerful. Thanks, {PlayerName}.
ç
Rapunzel_015_f{Well, I really love painting murals. I can tell him about that. And about ALL the mistakes I made trying to learn to paint.
`
Rapunzel_016_fNYou're right. His reputation is pretty important to him. I wonder why that is?
0
Player_003_choice_000_fIt's cool to be cool.
8
Player_003_choice_001_fHe's trying to prove himself.
8
Player_003_choice_002_fBecause he's actually a dork.
ß
Rapunzel_017_fîWait ‚Äî I just want to be sure... In this situation, "cool" means impressive, right? Because I don't know how being cold would help his reputation.
~
Rapunzel_018_flHuh... That's a thoughtful way of looking at it. Well, he's already proved to me that he's pretty wonderful.
i
Rapunzel_019_fWIf that means what I think it does, I guess he kind of is. But I like that. It's sweet.
u
Rapunzel_020_fcReally? I guess we did have a good conversation about it after we almost drowned in that dark cave.
p
Rapunzel_021_f^Thank goodness I remembered that my hair glows when I sing! We found our way out by its light.
*
Player_004_choice_000_fThat's awesome.
B
Player_004_choice_001_f'Sounds like he already knows about you.
W
Rapunzel_022_fEI'm glad you think so. Eugene was a little... let's say... surprised.
s
Rapunzel_023_faOf course, everything Eugene shares surprises me. He is the first person I've met besides Mother.
d
Rapunzel_024_fRThat's true. Maybe sharing MORE about my life in the tower could help him open up.
'
Rapunzel_025_fThanks, {PlayerName}!
