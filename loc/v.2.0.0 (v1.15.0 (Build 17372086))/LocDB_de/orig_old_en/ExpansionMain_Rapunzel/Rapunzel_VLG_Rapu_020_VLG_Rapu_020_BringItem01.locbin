Rapunzel_000_f®Chef Remy sends his best regards. He was dreaming of a dish that would inspire him in the kitchen again, and the one I made did the trick. He wanted you to try it, too.
i
Rapunzel_001_fWOh! It's spicy! And delicious ‚Äî it might be my new favorite thing since French bread!
ë
Rapunzel_004_fThank you so much for helping Remy. While you were doing that, I figured out whose dream should be next on our list. Ready? ...

Rapunzel_005_fGaston!

Player_000_choice_000_fFive-dozen-eggs Gaston?
#
Player_000_choice_001_fGo on...

Player_000_choice_002_f#Did you hit your head dune surfing?
@
Rapunzel_007_f.Boot-stomping, bragging, self-centered Gaston?
L
Rapunzel_009_f:Gaston with an ego bigger than Eternity Isle? THAT Gaston?

Rapunzel_010_fYep.
{
Rapunzel_015_fiGaston's had a pretty difficult time on the Isle. Don't you think he deserves his dream just like anyone?
1
Player_001_choice_000_fGood point ‚Äî I'm in!
@
Player_001_choice_001_f%What do we think Gaston dreams about?
,
Player_001_choice_002_fIf you're sure...
C
Rapunzel_017_f1Thank you. All right, here's what I'm thinking...
ù
Rapunzel_019_fäWe make Gaston feel like a hero by giving him the chance to rescue me ‚Äî a "damsel in distress" ‚Äî from a horrible creature in my tower!
;
Player_002_choice_000_f You're not a damsel in distress!
_
Player_002_choice_001_fDBut you're no damsel in distress, and there are no creatures here...
3
Player_002_choice_002_fIt's a little clich√©...
}
Rapunzel_021_fkOf course not, but I've read about them in a book from Merlin's library. I think I could pretend to be one.
T
Rapunzel_026_fBPLUS we're going to build an amazing creature he can save me from.
D
Rapunzel_027_f2... Okay... What do we need to make this creature?
p
Rapunzel_028_f^I was thinking papier-m√¢ch√©. I've made lots of masks before, so this shouldn't be too tough.
~
Rapunzel_029_flWe'll need <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and something to keep it from sticking to the molds. Hmm...
e
Rapunzel_030_fSWell... <ActivityItem>Plastic Scrap</ActivityItem> could work here. I'll find some.
ô
Rapunzel_031_fÜGreat! I'll also need some creepy crawly things like <ActivityItem>Scorpions</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Piranhas</ActivityItem>.
.
Rapunzel_032_fI'll go gather the supplies!
Z
Rapunzel_002_fHThanks! And I'm going to do a sketch of our creature to plan the design.
3
Rapunzel_020_f!We know that, but Gaston doesn't.
D
Rapunzel_023_f2Plus, I'm going to build us our very own creature.
Ö
Rapunzel_022_fsBut that's why it could work, right? Damsel, creature, hero! It's in so many stories I've read in Merlin's library.
p
Rapunzel_024_f^Well, it's easy enough for Gaston to figure out. Maybe you're right; that's just what we need.
:
Rapunzel_025_f(That and our very own homemade creature.

Rapunzel_016_f&Shinier boots? A monument to his hair?
R
Rapunzel_003_f@Maybe, but I think I might have an idea that's even more Gaston.
2
Rapunzel_018_f I'm VERY sure. Here's my plan...
@
Rapunzel_006_f.Well, most of the Villagers seem to avoid him.
e
Rapunzel_011_fSAnd it seems to me that he spends all his time just trying to get them to like him.
c
Rapunzel_012_fQMaybe if he tried a tactic other than bragging about how great he is, they would.
-
Rapunzel_008_fNo, it's nothing like that.
Z
Rapunzel_013_fHI just noticed that all he wants is for someone around here to like him.
j
Rapunzel_014_fXSeems like he likes himself enough... Are you sure you want to make his dream come true?
