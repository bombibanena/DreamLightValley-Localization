Mirabel_000_fkHola, {PlayerName}! I've been wanting to do something special for my cousin Antonio. Could you help me out?
B
Mirabel_001_f1Ooh! "Talks to animals" Antonio?! How can I help?
:
Mirabel_009_f)Well, I've been missing him a ton lately.
y
Mirabel_012_fhSo, I was thinking that maybe I'd write to him and tell him all about the cool animals on Eternity Isle.
r
Mirabel_013_faBut it'd be even cooler if I could show him photographs of the animals... with me alongside them!
M
Player_001_choice_003_f2Nature photography doesn't usually include people.
C
Player_001_choice_004_f(What kinds of animals does Antonio like?
K
Player_001_choice_005_f0Say no more ‚Äî sounds like a job for my Camera!
R
Mirabel_014_fAOkay... But I want to show Antonio that I REALLY saw all of them!
y
Mirabel_015_fhSome of the animals are so incredible, he might think the photos are drawings if I don't give him proof.
V
Player_002_choice_002_f;Got it ‚Äî we need incontrovertible photographic evidence!!
^
Player_002_choice_003_fCI can see all of the animals myself, and I STILL barely believe it.

Mirabel_016_fExactly!
Å
Mirabel_017_fpWell, after living with my family in Casita, I'm used to surprises. But this place has them around every corner!
X
Mirabel_018_fGOh, he likes ALL animals. Birds, jaguars, donkeys, butterflies, rats‚Äî
,
Player_003_choice_002_fLions and tigers!
4
Player_003_choice_003_fPenguins and polar bears!
!
Mirabel_019_fHe'd love those!
q
Mirabel_020_f`But there's one I definitely want to be sure and include. And the Wild Tangle has a lot of them.
N
Mirabel_021_f=He'd love those! But I don't think there are any around here.
v
Mirabel_022_feThere is one animal I definitely want to be sure and include. And there are a lot in the Wild Tangle.
p
Mirabel_023_f_Great! So I noticed there are <Lore>five different types of chig√ºiros</Lore> on Eternity Isle.
â
Mirabel_024_fxChig√ºiros...? Oh, that must be the Spanish name for <ActivityItem>Capybaras</ActivityItem>! They're all over the place.
À
Mirabel_025_fπWell, Antonio really loves chig√ºiros, especially his friend Chispi. If you could <Lore>get a photo of me with each of the ones here</Lore>, I know Antonio would think that was amazing!
R
Mirabel_027_fASince we're already hanging out together, how 'bout we do it now?
c
Mirabel_028_fR<Lore>Five pictures of Mirabel with Capybaras</Lore> for Antonio? It'll be a snap!
R
Mirabel_029_fAGet it? Like, because the Camera... Aw, forget it; let's do this.
&
Mirabel_026_fSure, let's hang out!
