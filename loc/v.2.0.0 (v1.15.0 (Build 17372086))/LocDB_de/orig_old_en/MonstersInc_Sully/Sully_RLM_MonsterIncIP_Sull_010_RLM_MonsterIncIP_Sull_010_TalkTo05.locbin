Player_000_choice_001_fWhat's my next intern duty?
+
Player_000_choice_002_fSo. Much. Slime.

Sully_008_f7Next up: Would ya mind fixing a coffee for me and Mike?
r
Sully_006_fcNormally, I'd grab it myself, but we're ALMOST done with the plan to get this place up and running.
?
Player_001_choice_000_f$Now we're talking REAL intern stuff!
Q
Player_001_choice_001_f6What do Monsters, Inc. employees like in their coffee?

Player_001_choice_002_fThis is a waste of my talents.

Sully_011_fHa-ha! You're tellin' me!
P
Sully_014_fAI delivered my share of coffee around this place back in the day.
°
Sully_015_fëAnyway, it's not a good idea to approach Mike until he's had his morning brew. And I think the extra caffeine boost will help us finish the plan!

Player_002_choice_000_fSo relatable! What do you need?

Player_002_choice_001_fWhat're your coffee orders?
£
Sully_016_fìI like my coffee <Lore>extra strong</Lore>. It takes about <Lore>five times the amount of a regular coffee</Lore> to get it as bitter as I like it.
ü
Sully_017_fèMike takes his with <Lore>a little non-dairy screamer</Lore> and <Lore>as much sugar as you can add</Lore>. He calls it "The Wazowski Special."
í
Sully_018_fÇAnd hey, I think a delivery of supplies just arrived. Everything you need is <Lore>over at the coffee station in Reception</Lore>.
É
Sully_001_ftWhen you've made 'em, would ya mind <Lore>bringing the coffees to Mike</Lore>? He needs his more urgently than I do.

Sully_005_fThanks, {PlayerName}!

Sully_010_f1In my experience, no two coffee orders are alike.
P
Sully_013_fALook, I know it's not as glamorous as being a Jokester. Trust me.

Sully_004_f_Trust me; I know! When Chalooby does the Mollusk Mambo, the floor's always like a skating rink.
