û
Sully_001_féWell, first off ‚Äî Dreamlight Valley's amazing! What you've built here is great. And I think I've got an idea that could make it even better.

Player_001_choice_000_fI'm glad you like it.
;
Player_001_choice_001_f Everything can always be better!
=
Player_001_choice_002_f"So, it's not good enough as it is?
d
Sully_004_fUI can tell you've put a ton of work in, but you shouldn't be the only one doing that.
Y
Sully_007_fJI wanna encourage other Villagers to help out more in Valley improvements.

Sully_008_fOkay... what are you thinking?
ã
Sully_009_f|Monsters, Inc. has this "Jokester of the Month" award. So, I was thinking there could be a Villager of the Month award here!
`
Sully_010_fQFolks would win by making real positive changes for the Valley. What do ya think?
,
Player_002_choice_000_fI love that idea.
8
Player_002_choice_001_fI'm willing to give it a try.
K
Player_002_choice_002_f0Couldn't it be kind of competitive in a bad way?
K
Sully_011_f<Great! Because uh... I kinda already started to organize it.
h
Sully_015_fYThree Villagers told me they have ideas for their own projects: Mike, Ursula, and Donald.
/
Sully_012_f Really? What are their projects?
©
Sully_016_fôI don't know yet. I told 'em that I wanted to be an impartial judge. But I'm kinda worried. Could ya go check on 'em? Maybe help 'em out if they need it?
K
Sully_003_f<It'll give you the perfect opportunity to see if this works.
^
Sully_017_fOSure! I'll check on <Lore>Ursula, Donald, and Mike's community projects.</Lore>

Sully_018_fGreat! Thanks, {PlayerName}!
}
Sully_013_fnGee, I hope not. My plan is to make sure it's about folks doin' good in the Village ‚Äî not chasing the award.
A
Sully_014_f2I'd still like to see a trial run before deciding.
\
Sully_005_fMI'm glad you think so too, but you're already doing so much for the Valley...
ç
Sully_006_f~No! No! That's not what I'm sayin'! It's just that you work so hard for the Valley, and I don't think you need to do it alone.

Sully_002_f&Okay, whenever you have a moment then.
