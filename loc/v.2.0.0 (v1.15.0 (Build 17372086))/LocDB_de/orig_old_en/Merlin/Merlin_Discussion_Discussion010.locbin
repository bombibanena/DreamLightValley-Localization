Merlin_000_f:Now, I must say, something is perplexing me, {PlayerName}.
U
Merlin_001_fEClearly, not all the laws of physics apply here in Dreamlight Valley.
•
Merlin_002_f„From the way you're able to cross between worlds, it appears space and time here are merely strong suggestions... not ironclad laws.
x
Merlin_003_fhYet other things remain immutable. Take gravity, for instance. What goes up still invariably comes down!

Player_000_choice_000_f"I wish it didn't. I'd love to fly.
F
Player_000_choice_001_f+It's weird. Maybe we should run some tests.
U
Player_000_choice_002_f:Maybe the laws of physics only work if we believe they do.
F
Merlin_004_f6Yes, I imagine it's an intriguing possibility for you.

Merlin_007_f{But for now, I'm afraid you'll have to content yourself with exploring the mysteries of the Valley down here on the ground.

Merlin_011_f™In any case, it seems that we are bound together by something much greater than gravity. I've a theory that it's friendship, but I'm still investigating.

Merlin_005_fAh-ha! A fine idea indeed.
_
Merlin_006_fOEr... just don't throw anything too valuable from anywhere too high, all right?
#
Merlin_008_fA fascinating idea!
~
Merlin_009_fnPerhaps if we could get all the Villagers to try NOT to follow the law of gravity anymore, it would disappear!
`
Merlin_010_fPNo, no, no. That's preposterous. How would that even be possible? Never mind me.
