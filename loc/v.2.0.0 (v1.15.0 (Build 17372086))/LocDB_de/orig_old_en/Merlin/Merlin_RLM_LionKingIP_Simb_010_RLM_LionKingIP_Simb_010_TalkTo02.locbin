Merlin_004_ffHmm... I get the peculiar feeling that you've stumbled upon yet another magical mystery, {PlayerName}.
O
Merlin_005_f?And considering where you've been, I surmise it involves lions.
4
Merlin_006_f$Well, er, have I surmised correctly?
)
Player_000_choice_000_fYou nailed it.
4
Player_000_choice_001_fI'm trying to help Simba.
O
Player_000_choice_002_f4Well done! You should add "surmiser" to your resume.
'
Merlin_007_fAh-ha! Do tell me more.
Q
Merlin_018_fALike slipping into a dream of some place you once knew, long ago.
I
Merlin_019_f9The Realms are tied to their memories and their feelings.
í
Merlin_020_fÅIt's possible that the sky in Simba's Realm is clouded precisely because his memories of his father are clouded with uncertainty.
%
Merlin_024_fSo how do I help him?
T
Merlin_022_fDSimba will need some magical aid... and some help with his troubles.
Å
Merlin_023_fqYou'll have to start by creating some sort of object to channel the spell. Something that holds meaning to Simba.
K
Player_003_f;Hmm. But what kind of object would hold meaning for a lion?
%
Player_003_choice_000_f
A cat toy?
9
Player_003_choice_001_fMaybe a platter full of grubs?
3
Player_003_choice_002_fSomething from his past?
p
Merlin_008_f`I passed through that door in the Castle and found myself in a new Realm, somewhere in a jungle.
s
Merlin_012_fcI met Simba there. But he won't come back to Dreamlight Valley unless I can help him see the stars.
O
Merlin_000_f?He wants to get some guidance from the great kings of the past.
û
Merlin_013_fçThat shouldn't prove to be too difficult. There's almost nothing as constant as the stars. Simply wait for night and then... well... look up.
q
Merlin_014_faThat's the problem. Simba can't even remember the last time he saw the stars. It's always cloudy.
U
Merlin_015_fEI think something strange is going on. Possibly something magical...?
H
Merlin_016_f8That is a bit odd. But I suspect I know the explanation.
x
Merlin_017_fhThe Realms that you visit are worlds the Villagers created when they needed to escape Dreamlight Valley.
U
Merlin_030_fEThere is a difference between a lion and a common housecat, you know.
6
Merlin_034_f&You'll need something personal to him.
"
Merlin_035_fWait! I've got it.
t
Merlin_025_fdSimba mentioned someone bopping him over the head with a walking stick to knock some sense into him.
b
Merlin_026_fRThat sounds like precisely what you'll need. Just the sight of it might be enough.
f
Merlin_027_fVNext you'll need to infuse it with <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>.
®
Merlin_003_fóOnce you've done that, <Lore>find the point in the jungle nearest the sky, point the walking stick towards the clouds, and command them to part</Lore>.
{
Merlin_028_fkBe careful, though. This is dangerous magic. You'll be influencing the very fabric of reality in the Realm.
0
Merlin_029_f It'll be worth it to help Simba.
.
Merlin_031_fHe really seems to like grubs.
t
Merlin_033_fdI don't think that will do. He might like eating them, but I doubt they hold much sentimental value.

Merlin_032_fYes, precisely.
Q
Merlin_009_fAAh, of course. Our old friend, Simba! See, I was right ‚Äî lions!
M
Merlin_010_f=You could put it right between "wizard" and "prognosticator."
c
Merlin_011_fSWell then, I suppose that means I got it right. Now, tell me what happened exactly.
