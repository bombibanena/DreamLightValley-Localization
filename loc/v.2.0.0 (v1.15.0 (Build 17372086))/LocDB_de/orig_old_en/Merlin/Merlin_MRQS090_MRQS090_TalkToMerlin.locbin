Merlin_002_fwBlast it all! We have a new problem. There's some sort of Dark Magic hanging over the great tree in the Glade of Trust.
j
Merlin_000_fZThis is different from the other Dark Magic we've faced. It's trickier; far more powerful.
Š
Merlin_008_fzI suspect one of the Villagers was meddling in bewitchments that have no place in this Valley, and it went terribly wrong.
ù
Merlin_004_fèI feared that not even your vast magic would be enough to lift the spell. But now that the <ActivityItem>Orbs of Friendship, Power, and Courage</ActivityItem> are back in their rightful places, I know I can trust you with this task.

Player_000_fUYou want me to go to the Glade of Trust and try to lift the Dark Magic from the tree?

Player_000_choice_001_fThat seems a little scary...

Player_000_choice_002_fWhy not do it yourself?

Merlin_005_f That's the spirit, {PlayerName}!
i
Merlin_001_fYNow, as soon as you can, <Lore>head to the Glade</Lore> and focus your magic on the tree.
s
Merlin_006_fcBefore you can trust anyone else, you must trust in yourself, {PlayerName}. I know you can do this.
i
Merlin_007_fYI fear my magic isn't strong enough yet. But you've demonstrated that yours certainly is!
