W
Merlin_000_fGWhat's this? Are my spectacles enchanted or might you actually be real?
.
Player_001_choice_000_fOf course I'm real!
4
Player_001_choice_001_fI don't know. Are you...?
:
Player_001_choice_002_fWhat kind of question is that?!
<
Merlin_020_f,Well, you never can be too sure around here.
T
Merlin_012_fDI'm afraid you'll have to excuse me. I haven't met anyone in ages...
M
Merlin_060_f=Ahem... Welcome to <Lore>Dreamlight Valley</Lore>, my friend!
@
Merlin_025_f0<Lore>Dreamlight Valley</Lore>? This place is...
2
Player_000_choice_006_f...strangely beautiful.
-
Player_000_choice_007_f...sort of creepy.
1
Player_000_choice_008_f...awfully mysterious.
<
Merlin_034_f,This place is so cool. I want to explore it!
}
Merlin_027_fmQuite understandable. Why, in all my travels, I've yet to find another realm as filled with magic and wonder.
Y
Merlin_029_fIIn its present state, however, it's a... well, it's a sorry sight indeed.
\
Merlin_015_fLOh, but I haven't introduced myself yet! You're no doubt wondering who I am.
.
Player_000_choice_009_fDuh. You're Merlin!
;
Player_000_choice_010_f Um. You're some sorta... wizard?
5
Player_000_choice_011_fYou're a very odd old man.
?
Merlin_039_f/It's so strange. I almost feel like I know you.
1
Player_000_choice_012_fMagic? Me? Ha! No way.
7
Player_000_choice_013_fI don't know HOW I got here!
4
Player_000_choice_015_fOh, uh, yes! Great magic!
:
Merlin_044_f*You're a great and powerful wizard, right?
7
Merlin_046_f'Well... yes... but not just any wizard!
\
Merlin_041_fLI'm a soothsayer! A prognosticator! I have the power to see into the future.
K
Merlin_005_f;And I'm also quite skilled at alchemy and prestidigitation!
S
Merlin_006_fCNow that that's settled, there's the small matter of who YOU are...
%
Merlin_038_fMe? I'm {PlayerName}.
{
Merlin_052_fk{PlayerName}, hmm? Well, the only way to get to Dreamlight Valley is to pass through <Lore>dreams</Lore>...
W
Merlin_047_fGSo you must also possess great magic. Otherwise, how could you be here?
Y
Merlin_048_fIWhen it comes to magic, I can't tell an "abracadabra" from an "alacazam."
h
Merlin_055_fXOh, I think you'll find that magic often chooses us. And rarely does it choose unwisely.
‹
Merlin_054_f{In fact, I'm quite certain that you're the one we've been waiting for. <Lore>You're going to save Dreamlight Valley</Lore>!

Player_000_choice_017_fWhat's in it for me?

V
Merlin_002_fFAh-ha! That spirit of friendship is just what Dreamlight Valley needs!
^
Merlin_008_fNAll right, listen closely and I'll tell you the tale... before I forget again!
u
Merlin_045_feAnd as I can see into the future, I knew that someday, someone would come to help restore the Valley.
=
Player_000_choice_003_f"Tell me more about the Forgetting.
@
Player_000_choice_004_f%Tell me more about the missing Ruler.
@
Player_000_choice_005_f%I'm ready to help restore the Valley!
@
Merlin_011_f0If we're to restore the Valley to what it was...

&
Merlin_058_fWe must... we must...!
V
Merlin_057_fFI'm... I'm sorry, I can't seem to remember what we were talking about.
/
Merlin_022_f<Lore>The Forgetting</Lore>...?
5
Merlin_037_f%Ah, yes! <Lore>The Forgetting</Lore>!
V
Merlin_059_fFYou'll have to forgive me, but now you can see where it gets its name.
o
Merlin_061_f_Yes, yes, of course. Let me see... Well, when our <Lore>Ruler</Lore> left, the sky turned dark.
z
Merlin_062_fjThen those horrid <Lore>Night Thorns</Lore> infested the Village, spreading everywhere like a bad thought.
g
Merlin_063_fWThe more <Lore>Night Thorns</Lore> that appeared, the more clouded our memories became.
Š
Merlin_001_fzWhy, sometimes I can't remember the faces of all the friends I've lost... or the names of all the spells I've forgotten...
8
Player_001_choice_003_f...your memories will return.
:
Player_001_choice_004_f...your friends will come back!
Q
Player_001_choice_005_f6...the magic of the Valley will be stronger than ever.
h
Merlin_003_fX<Lore>Get rid of the Night Thorns</Lore>... Hmm... now there's an interesting thought...
²
Merlin_013_f¡Well now, all the wonder, magic, and friendship in this Valley came from our <Lore>Ruler</Lore>. They watched over the Village, and kept us safe from Dark Magic.
e
Merlin_064_fUBut one day, they started to act... different. Though I can scarcely remember it now.
7
Merlin_065_f'And then, our Ruler simply... vanished.
e
Merlin_019_fUIt's been... years, I think... I've lost all track of time because of the Forgetting.
/
Player_002_fYour Ruler just... up and left?
<
Player_002_choice_000_f!Doesn't sound like a great Ruler.
<
Player_002_choice_001_f!There must have been some reason.
F
Player_002_choice_002_f+Maybe the Forgetting made your Ruler leave?
^
Merlin_066_fNA good Ruler would take care of the Village and its people, not just run away.
š
Merlin_067_f‰Oh, our Ruler was kind and very noble. There must have been quite a good reason for why they left. Though I can't remember what it was...
O
Merlin_068_f?Maybe your Ruler had to leave. Maybe they didn't have a choice.

Merlin_070_fThat certainly seems logical. Yes, the Forgetting must be connected to our Ruler in some way... if only I could remember how...
Š
Merlin_016_fzWell, there's only one way to be absolutely certain you're the one destined to save Dreamlight Valley from the Forgetting.
6
Merlin_024_f&It'll be a small test of your magic...
€
Merlin_028_fpYou see, ever since the Forgetting, I've been puzzled about this <Lore>House blocked by the Night Thorns.</Lore>
:
Merlin_018_f*Come along. We'll investigate it together.
B
Merlin_009_f2Why, all the joys of Dreamlight Valley, of course!
d
Merlin_010_fTA wise question, indeed. After all, a problem can't be solved until it's understood!
Y
Merlin_051_fII just closed my eyes and drifted off and... all of a sudden, I was here!
0
Merlin_004_f Magic had nothing to do with it.
G
Merlin_007_f7Quite the contrary. Magic had everything to do with it!
J
Merlin_049_f:Better watch out, Merlin. I'm pretty good at magic myself!
k
Merlin_050_f[You're not the only soothsayer, prognosticator, prestidigitator, and alchemist around here!
!
Merlin_053_fAh-ha! I knew it!
$
Merlin_040_fNot just any wizard!


#
Merlin_043_fAnd that's not all!
5
Merlin_035_f%This place isn't... dangerous, is it?
~
Merlin_030_fnWell, it's true that the Valley is a sorry sight compared to what it used to be. But you have nothing to fear.
k
Merlin_031_f[Why, once upon a time, you couldn't find another realm with as much magic and wonder in it.
b
Merlin_036_fRI feel like I could explore this place forever and still not find all its secrets!
5
Merlin_032_f%Yes, the Valley is full of mysteries.
S
Merlin_033_fCBut there was a time when it was also filled with magic and wonder.
X
Merlin_021_fHHmm. That's quite an existential question. I'll have to ponder it later.
:
Merlin_026_f*Oh, dear. You must be dreadfully confused.
