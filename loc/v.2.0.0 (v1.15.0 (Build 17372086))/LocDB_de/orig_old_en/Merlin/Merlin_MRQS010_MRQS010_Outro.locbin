Merlin_018_fXGoodness! The glowing Orb you pulled from the Night Thorn... it's a <Lore>Memory</Lore>!
]
Merlin_019_fMIt's like a fog has lifted, and I can recall something of great importance...
Å
Merlin_022_fqMickey Mouse and I were at the <Lore>Dream Castle</Lore>... and we left something there... something important...
,
Player_000_choice_003_fLet's go find it.
'
Player_000_choice_004_fWhat was it?
4
Player_000_choice_005_fI want to see the Castle!
R
Merlin_004_fBThat's the spirit! Of course, I can't remember what it was, but‚Äî
C
Merlin_028_f3But wait! There's something else returning to me...
}
Merlin_009_fmWhen our Ruler left, the <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem> were lost, scattered throughout the Valley.
h
Merlin_010_fXWe must find them, quickly. They're filled with <Lore>ancient and powerful magic</Lore>.
Z
Merlin_031_fJThe <Lore>Royal Tools</Lore>? If I could find those, then maybe I could...
.
Player_000_choice_006_f...help the Valley!
8
Player_000_choice_007_f...learn more powerful magic!
B
Player_000_choice_008_f'...solve the mystery of the Forgetting!
Ç
Merlin_011_frYou have a pure heart, {PlayerName}. It's only through helping each other that we'll get out of this blasted mess.
:
Merlin_024_f*That is... if you're staying here with us.
%
Player_001_choice_000_f
Of course!

Player_001_choice_001_f...for now.
8
Player_001_choice_002_fI just want to meet everyone!
?
Merlin_017_f/First, we must obtain the <Lore>Pickaxe</Lore>.
|
Merlin_029_flWhen the Forgetting came and our Ruler left, we found the Pickaxe driven into a blighted stone in the Plaza.
ß
Merlin_021_fñCome to think of it, that was around the time the sky went dark and the Night Thorns overran the Plaza. Though it's all a bit of a muddle, I'm afraid.
z
Merlin_023_fjNo one's been able to <Lore>lift the Pickaxe from the stone</Lore>. But then no one was you, {PlayerName}.
Ä
Merlin_003_fpAnd, after all, it wouldn't be the first time someone pulled something from a stone and became a hero of legend.
a
Merlin_012_fQ<Lore>Pull the Pickaxe from the stone in the Plaza</Lore>. Got it. Anything else?
∂
Merlin_034_f•You must also find the other three <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem>: the <Lore>Shovel</Lore>, the <Lore>Watering Can</Lore> and the <Lore>Fishing Rod</Lore>.

Merlin_035_f$You'll need them for what's to come.
M
Merlin_025_f=Magnificent! Then this House shall be <Lore>your home</Lore>.
]
Merlin_032_fMYou'll need a safe place in the Valley to eat, sleep and keep your Energy up.
6
Player_000_choice_000_fIt's got so much potential!
0
Player_000_choice_001_fIt's a bit of a mess.
)
Player_000_choice_002_fIt's so small.
s
Merlin_002_fcThat's the spirit! Just as a whispered word can conjure great magic, this House holds much promise.
k
Merlin_000_f[In fact, I seem to remember that the Ruler of Dreamlight Valley had a house like this once.
Ü
Merlin_007_fvPerhaps you'll do as much good for the Valley as our Ruler did! In fact, here's a little something to get you started.
y
Merlin_016_fiIf you ever feel like you need a boost of Energy, there's something in there that will fill you right up.
_
Merlin_014_fONow then, I'll be at the Dream Castle. You can find me there when you're ready.
,
Merlin_001_fAh, but it wasn't always so.
Ä
Merlin_026_fpWell then, you'll still need a safe place to eat, sleep and keep your Energy up ‚Äî even if it's only temporary.
>
Merlin_030_f.So consider this House <Lore>your home</Lore>.
Å
Merlin_027_fqWell, there are a few Villagers scattered about... and others... well, they'll need your help now more than ever.
w
Merlin_020_fgOf course, you'll need a safe place to eat, sleep and keep your Energy up if you're going to help them.
Y
Merlin_013_fIPerhaps. But remember: Magic is only as pure as the heart that wields it.
V
Merlin_015_fFWell, there's certainly no shortage of mysteries to solve around here.
S
Merlin_005_fCOh dear, I can't remember. We'll just have to go see for ourselves.
b
Merlin_006_fRAs you should. The Castle is magnificent, though I'm afraid it's seen better days.
c
Merlin_008_fSIf only I could remember what we'd left there. Well, we must go solve this mystery!
