Merlin_000_fpHmm? A <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> covered in carvings... or rather runes, as that's what these are.
j
Merlin_003_fZAriel found it near some sort of door in a cave near Dazzle Beach. Do you know what it is?
s
Merlin_014_fcWell, it's likely a key of some kind. But as for what might be behind the door, I can't be certain.
§
Merlin_004_fìYou know, I've always thought there were people who walked this island long before any of us did. Dreamlight Valley is old, {PlayerName}. Very old.

Player_000_choice_003_fEven older than you? No way!

Player_000_choice_004_fPeople? Who were they?
Z
Merlin_009_fJI'll have you know that for a wizard, I'm barely a whippersnapper! Ahem...
|
Merlin_011_flI haven't the faintest idea who the people were. <Lore>But these runes must have been their language</Lore>.
Ö
Merlin_012_fuI've seen them in various spots around the Village, but I've only just begun to decipher their meaning. Let me see...

Player_000_choice_006_fTake your time.

Merlin_015_f'Ah-ha! I believe I know what this says!
û
Merlin_016_fçThe people who made this door wanted to be sure no one could pass through it alone. You'll need something from other Villagers to get inside.

Player_000_choice_008_fTools?

Player_000_choice_009_fSomething magic?
C
Player_000_choice_010_f(We could all try pushing on it together!
D
Merlin_017_f4Tools? No, no, I'm afraid tools will do you no good.
y
Merlin_020_fiIt seems the people who wrote these runes trusted only in <Lore>emotions</Lore> and the power of stories.
Ú
Merlin_021_f·To open the door, you'll have to enchant this <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> by filling it with <Lore>Fiery Passion</Lore>, <Lore>Seething Anger</Lore>, <Lore>Perfect Joy</Lore> and <Lore>Exuberant Excitement</Lore>.
&
Merlin_006_fHuh? How do I do that?
ë
Merlin_007_fÄWhy, you simply find four Villagers and have them hold the <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> while they feel each emotion.
E
Player_000_choice_000_f*Sounds like I have my work cut out for me.
@
Player_000_choice_002_f%Can't anything be simple around here?
r
Merlin_010_fbPerhaps Ariel can help you figure out which Villagers best embody the emotions you're looking for.
É
Merlin_008_fsThe beauty of the world lies in its complexity, my friend. Besides, this sounds like a rather fun mystery to solve.

Merlin_018_f.Magic? Hm. Well, a magic of a sort, I suppose.

Merlin_019_fEPushing on it? No, no, I'm afraid all we'd do is throw our backs out.
