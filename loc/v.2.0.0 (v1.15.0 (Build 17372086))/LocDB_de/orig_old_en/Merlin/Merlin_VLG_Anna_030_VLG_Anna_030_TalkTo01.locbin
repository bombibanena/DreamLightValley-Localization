Merlin_000_fPAh, {PlayerName}! You're here to ask me for help with Anna's plight, aren't you?
¯
Merlin_008_fžI tried to explain the spell to her, but when I speak to the other Villagers about magic, they look at me as if I'm speaking gibberish. It's the oddest thing.
4
Player_000_choice_000_fIt all makes sense to me.
7
Player_000_choice_001_fI can mostly understand you.
:
Player_000_choice_002_fHalf the time, it IS gibberish!
K
Merlin_009_f;Yes, I know. Your magical sensibilities are quite advanced.
°
Merlin_006_fŸBut not just any mushroom. You must go to the shadow of the Giant Willow in the Glade of Trust and pick some of the <ActivityItem>Red Mushrooms</ActivityItem>.
u
Merlin_014_feOnce you have those, find a Crafting Station and mix it all together with this acceleration liquid...
†
Merlin_007_fvIn any case, now that Kristoff has begun to regain some of his memories, I know just the thing to bring back the rest!
~
Merlin_002_fnYou'll need something that's important to both Anna and Kristoff to enchant. Something symbolic of their love.
P
Merlin_012_f@Hmm... maybe their <ActivityItem>Engagement Ring</ActivityItem>?
*
Merlin_004_fOh yes, that'll do nicely.
w
Merlin_013_fgNow, you'll also need some <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>, to give it that spark of magic...
U
Merlin_001_fE...and to draw out memories buried in the dark, you'll need a fungus.

Merlin_003_f
A fungus?!
*
Merlin_005_fA mushroom, to be precise.
µ
Merlin_010_f¤Hmm... I suppose I do have to remember that not everyone is versed in magical terminology. I shall strive to approach them as students requiring clear explanations.
‡
Merlin_011_fwOn the contrary, my language is extremely precise. Read a few more books and you'll be able to follow along quite well.
