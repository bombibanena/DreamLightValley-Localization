Merlin_000_f{Prince Eric was in the Sea Witch's clutches all this time? Oh dear. I see she gave him back his freedom but not his body...
™
Merlin_001_fˆThat's just what I'd expect from a scoundrel like Ursula. Always cheating to get what she wants. Tread lightly around her, {PlayerName}.
„
Merlin_006_ftNow, as luck would have it, I was just reading a book on transfiguration. It may hold the key to changing Eric back.
z
Merlin_012_fjIt's called "Transfigure Your Troubles Away: How to Turn a Frog Back into a Prince in Three Simple Steps."

Player_000_choice_005_fBut Eric's not a frog!
‡
Merlin_013_fwThere are no coincidences in Dreamlight Valley. Subconsciously, I must have known to pull it off my shelf this morning.

Merlin_008_fTrue Love's Kiss.

Player_000_choice_006_fBlecchh!
(
Player_000_choice_007_fHow romantic!
@
Player_000_choice_008_f%I'm not kissing him, that's for sure.
a
Merlin_015_fQOf course Eric is not a frog, but he is a prince, so the same magic should apply.
)
Merlin_016_fSo what's the first step?
u
Merlin_002_feLet's see... the first step when turning a frog into a prince is to build him a home fit for royalty.
}
Merlin_003_fmI suppose that means you'll have to <Lore>start by making a House for Prince Eric</Lore> here in the Village.
H
Merlin_007_f8Got it. Build Prince Eric a House. What's the next step?
¶
Merlin_009_f¥Next, the prince needs some sort of object to anchor him to the human realm. <Lore>Once you've built his House, search it to find something important to Eric.</Lore>
v
Merlin_010_ffBuild him a House and find an object that's near and dear to his heart. Got it. What's the third step?
Q
Merlin_011_fAAccording to the book, the final step is a classic, {PlayerName}.
`
Merlin_017_fPWell yes, it is a bit... romantic, but there's no magic more powerful than love.

Merlin_020_f)It's Ariel's love that will restore Eric.
¤
Merlin_004_f“Now, once you've found a suitable object in his House, bring it to her and have her call his name three times while picturing Eric as he should be.
‘
Merlin_005_f€That should restore him. Then, to make sure the spell is permanent, she'll have to kiss him soon after. Good luck, {PlayerName}!
[
Merlin_018_fKI find it a tad silly myself, but there's no magic more powerful than love.
?
Merlin_019_f/No one's asking YOU to kiss Eric, {PlayerName}.
z
Merlin_014_fjCertainly not. I do not lend books from my private library. Particularly ones filled with dangerous magic.
