F
Rapunzel_002_f4Of course, {PlayerName}. I always have time for fun!

Rapunzel_003_flIn fact, I was just about to offer to reorganize Merlin's library based on colors instead of alphabetically.

d
Player_000_choice_001_fIHonestly, that's probably more organized than how Merlin's books are now.

Rapunzel_009_fOkay, I have an idea!
w
Rapunzel_010_feI've been thinking about colors a lot lately and how I can make more interesting choices with my art.

Rapunzel_011_f&So I've decided to paint a still life.

Rapunzel_012_f<Here's my challenge: <Lore>Bring me 3 colorful meals</Lore>.
