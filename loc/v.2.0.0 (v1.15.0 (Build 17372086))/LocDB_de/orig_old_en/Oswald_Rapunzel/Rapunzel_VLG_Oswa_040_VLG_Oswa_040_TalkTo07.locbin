Rapunzel_000_f8Hey Rapunzel, can I bother you for something real quick?
K
Rapunzel_001_f9Of course! I mean... you're never a bother, {PlayerName}.
)
Rapunzel_011_fA trolley? What's that?
4
Player_000_choice_000_fOh boy, where do I start?
X
Player_000_choice_001_f=Uhh, let's just say it's Oswald's pet and move on from there.
j
Rapunzel_013_fXI guess you could say that it's sort of like a horseless carriage that moves on its own.
ì
Rapunzel_014_fÄIt drives around an area in a preset loop, and people can get on and off to get to where they're going faster than just walking.
>
Rapunzel_015_f,And Oswald brought one here? That's amazing!
!
Rapunzel_016_fCould I see it?
?
Rapunzel_017_f-Well, uhh... it escaped and we can't find it.
=
Rapunzel_020_f+The trolley... escaped? I don't understand.
d
Rapunzel_022_fRAnd besides, finding the lost trolley is much more important than a few paintings.

Rapunzel_012_f!Amazing. I owe you one, Rapunzel.
F
Rapunzel_002_f4{PlayerName}, I'm worried for the poor lost trolley!
V
Rapunzel_003_fDIs there anything I can do to help? Are you creating a search party?
:
Rapunzel_004_f(Actually, there is something you can do!
`
Rapunzel_005_fNWe wanted to make some "Missing" posters and set them up around Eternity Isle.
Q
Rapunzel_006_f?Of course! That way you can get everyone on the Island to help.
J
Rapunzel_007_f8And I have some blank canvasses you can use if you want.
/
Rapunzel_008_fYou sure you won't need them?
ù
Rapunzel_009_fäI won't. I've been exploring non-standard canvasses recently. I did an oval painting yesterday, and I'm working on a dodecahedral one now.
:
Rapunzel_018_f(Well, I love pets and animal companions.
:
Rapunzel_019_f(Can I see the new trolley and say hello?
I
Rapunzel_021_f7Um, it's basically a type of machine... and it escaped.
