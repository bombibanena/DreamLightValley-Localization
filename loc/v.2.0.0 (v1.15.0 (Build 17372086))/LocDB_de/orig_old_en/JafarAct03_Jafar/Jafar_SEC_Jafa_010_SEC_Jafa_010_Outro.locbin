Q
Jafar_001_fB{PlayerName}, I am unsure of how to respond to all this pageantry.
C
Jafar_002_f4You don't have to respond any particular way at all!
‰
Jafar_003_fzWe recognized that you were making an effort to be nice to the other Villagers, so we wanted to give something to you too.
[
Jafar_004_fLYou're a citizen like everyone else now. You can just be yourself and relax!
†
Jafar_005_fwI am... unused to such treatment. Had the Sultan recognized me like this, perhaps I would have reconsidered my actions.
Z
Jafar_006_fKWell, this is the vibe I'm trying to cultivate here. And I have to admit...
M
Jafar_008_f>...I wanted to think the best of you, and you proved me right.
,
Jafar_017_fHmm, yeah, well if they do...
Z
Jafar_018_fK...I'll still be here, ready to stop your plots before they even get going.
E
Jafar_019_f6I would not expect anything less of you, {PlayerName}.
i
Jafar_009_fZI'm glad that we were able to get you to make amends with everyone and settle in properly.
k
Jafar_011_f\Well, when the choice was between biting my tongue for a time or going back into the lamp...
'
Jafar_012_f...the choice was clear.

Jafar_013_fN"Biting your tongue"? Jafar, are you saying that you still have plots brewing?
*
Jafar_014_fI said nothing of the sort.
L
Jafar_015_f=Well, I guess that's as good as I can get with you, isn't it?
j
Jafar_020_f[{PlayerName}, you truly are my most competent adversary, and for that, you have my respect.
\
Jafar_016_fMI cannot be but myself. One can only hope that does not put us at odds again.
e
Jafar_010_fV...I thought you were up to something, but I've never been happier to be proven wrong.
