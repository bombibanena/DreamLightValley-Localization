Jafar_000_fHey Jafar, got a moment?
V
Jafar_009_fGI have been hard at work here. That automaton simply has it out for me.

Jafar_010_fEVE? Really?
\
Jafar_011_fMIt is understandable â€” not everyone here shares your perspicacious outlook.
e
Jafar_012_fVI would imagine that she simply needs more time to see the truth of my changed nature.
ž
Jafar_013_fŽBut please, do not chastise her on my behalf. I am sure she is simply working with the good of the Isle at heart â€” despite her lack thereof.
D
Player_000_choice_000_f)Hmm, that's very forgiving of you, Jafar.

Player_000_choice_001_f"You're up to something; I know it!
=
Jafar_001_f.I am rather consumed by my work at the moment.
?
Jafar_002_f0Well, there's something really strange going on.
m
Jafar_003_f^Oswald is feeling sick, and some of the Villagers are acting very unlike their regular selves.

Jafar_004_fHow unfortunate.
5
Jafar_005_f&Yeah... Do you know anything about it?

Jafar_006_f€Alas, I do not. I have been hard at work in my laboratory. I am afraid I know little of the goings-on of the rest of the Island.
W
Jafar_007_fHYou sure? EVE mentioned that you planted... or gave something to people?
,
Jafar_008_fThat is utterly preposterous!
E
Jafar_015_f6Yes, it seems that compassion is in the very air here.

Jafar_022_f/I am? Pray tell, {PlayerName}, what am I up to?
<
Jafar_023_f-I don't know yet, but I've got my eye on you.

Jafar_024_f Goodness. How simply terrifying.
