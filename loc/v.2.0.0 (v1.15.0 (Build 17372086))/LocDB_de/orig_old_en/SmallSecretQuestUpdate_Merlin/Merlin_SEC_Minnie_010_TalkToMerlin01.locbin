Merlin_000_fRAh, {PlayerName}. I believe I know precisely why you've come to speak to me today.
~
Merlin_001_fnIt's Minnie, isn't it? She's gotten herself in quite a jumble, worrying she might disappear again, hasn't she?
I
Player_000_f9It's Minnie, all right. She asked me to come talk to you.

Player_000_choice_000_fWe need a wizard for this.
9
Player_000_choice_001_fShe didn't want to bother you.
@
Player_000_choice_002_f%You know. Since you're Mr. Magic Guy.
V
Merlin_002_fFHmm, well, yes, I... uh... I suppose you do, for matters such as this.
F
Merlin_003_f6Is there anything in your magic books that might help?
Ö
Merlin_004_fuActually, I've given it quite a lot of careful thought, and I think I know precisely how we can fix this predicament.
°
Merlin_005_fêWe'll use the most powerful kind of magic there is. First, you'll need to speak to some Villagers and ask them what they like best about Minnie.
M
Merlin_006_f=Hmm... maybe I should <Lore>ask Elsa, Anna, and Moana.</Lore>
ó
Merlin_007_fÜAnd listen closely ‚Äî this part is key. Once you've spoken to them, you must bring me some <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>.
h
Merlin_008_fXWith all that, we can sort out Minnie's dilemma... or at least, I very much hope we can.
[
Merlin_009_fKNonsense. She could never be a bother. I'm happy to assist in such matters.
Y
Merlin_010_fIEr, thank you... I suppose. Though I'm not terribly fond of that moniker.
