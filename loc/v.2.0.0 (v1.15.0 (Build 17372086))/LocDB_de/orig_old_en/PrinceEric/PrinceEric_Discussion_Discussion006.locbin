PrinceEric_000_fg{PlayerName}, I really want to do something nice for Ariel. So I thought I should take her on a picnic.
H
PrinceEric_001_f4Just the two of us. Where do you think we should go?
(
Player_000_choice_000_fDazzle Beach!
/
Player_000_choice_001_fThe Forest of Valor!
/
Player_000_choice_002_fThe Frosted Heights!
E
PrinceEric_002_f1That's a great idea! A blanket, some nice food...

PrinceEric_005_f#Watching the waves and the horizon.
j
PrinceEric_007_fVWell, the location's decided. What should I bring along to enjoy with our main course?
!
Player_001_choice_000_fFruit.
/
Player_001_choice_001_fFreshly baked bread.

Player_001_choice_002_fChocolate chip cookies.
`
PrinceEric_008_fLSounds good! I'll gather some different fruit and maybe visit Goofy's Stall.
'
PrinceEric_009_fAriel will love it.
b
PrinceEric_010_fNShe gets almost as excited about surface food as she does about human objects.
F
PrinceEric_011_f2Yeah! Merfolk can't exactly mill flour underwater.
N
PrinceEric_012_f:So I bet Ariel hasn't tried many different kinds of bread.
;
PrinceEric_013_f'I'll ask Remy if he has any good ideas.
E
PrinceEric_014_f1Great idea. We definitely have to have a dessert.
u
PrinceEric_003_faYeah, that'd be nice. I can lay down a blanket beside the river and she can swim up alongside me.
`
PrinceEric_004_fLThat's a little cold for us, but I bet Ariel would like to explore up there.

PrinceEric_006_fIt would be an adventure.
