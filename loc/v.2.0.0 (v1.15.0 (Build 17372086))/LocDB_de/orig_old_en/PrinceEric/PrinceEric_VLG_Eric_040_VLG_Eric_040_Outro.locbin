Player_000_choice_002_f/...heavy. How do you walk around in that thing?
ì
PrinceEric_001_fI'll go put the <ActivityItem>Diving Suit</ActivityItem> together and head out on my first expedition. See you when I get back!
Å
PrinceEric_007_fmWell, my dive was a big success! I found all kinds of odd and mystical stuff on the sea floor by those ruins.
ó
PrinceEric_003_fÇIf you're interested, I'll have the blueprints for them at my House. You might be able to use a few to make things for the Valley.

PrinceEric_006_fSounds great!
¥
PrinceEric_002_füAnd hey... now that I've found what I was looking for, I won't be needing this <ActivityItem>Diving Helmet</ActivityItem> anymore. I'd love for you to have it.

PrinceEric_009_fdHa-ha! Yeah, if we ever have an "Under the Sea" fashion show here in the Valley, you'll be the star.
≈
PrinceEric_005_f∞Oh... and Ariel and I also wanted you to have this. We can never thank you enough, {PlayerName}, but maybe this gift we made will give you some idea of how much you mean to us.

PrinceEric_010_feJust be careful. You should probably leave searching the bottom of the sea to us professionals, okay?
