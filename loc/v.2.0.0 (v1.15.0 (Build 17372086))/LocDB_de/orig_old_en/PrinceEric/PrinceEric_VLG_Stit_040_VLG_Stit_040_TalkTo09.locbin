PrinceEric_003_f'Hey, Eric... you play the flute, right?
K
PrinceEric_004_f7I do. But I haven't had much chance to practice lately.
&
PrinceEric_005_fI'm kind of rusty.
{
PrinceEric_006_fgNot too rusty, I hope? Stitch is putting together a band. I think it'd be great if you'd play with him.
Y
PrinceEric_012_fEKristoff has already agreed to join. I think you'd make a great trio.
M
Player_000_choice_000_f2You could get some practice with your flute again.
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/Stitch would love to have a prince in his band.
:
Player_000_choice_002_fIt's just for fun. No pressure.
\
PrinceEric_007_fHWell, it would give me the chance to play more and learn some new songs.
%
PrinceEric_013_fSure, I'll do it!
k
PrinceEric_014_fWGreat! Start practicing. In the meantime, I'm going to <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>.
Š
PrinceEric_017_fvNow that we've got a band together, you'll need to put on a concert. Maybe he has some sound equipment he can lend us.
W
PrinceEric_015_fCGreat! Now I just have to <Lore>find one more band member...</Lore>
N
PrinceEric_016_f:Hmm... isn't there someone around here who plays the lute?
ˆ
PrinceEric_008_ftYou might be right. He was asking me something about a music-playing king the other day, but I'd never heard of him.
J
PrinceEric_009_f6It would be fun to play music with other people again.
