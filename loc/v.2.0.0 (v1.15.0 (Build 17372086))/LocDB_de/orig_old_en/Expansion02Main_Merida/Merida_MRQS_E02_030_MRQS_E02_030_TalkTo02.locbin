Merida_000_f-So, how's your adventure going, {PlayerName}?
É
Merida_001_fsLet me guess... You've already sat Maleficent and Hades down for tea and gotten them to hash out their wee quarrel?
0
Player_000_choice_000_fUh, yeah, definitely!
-
Player_000_choice_001_fI'm getting there.
,
Player_000_choice_002_fNot even close...
z
Merida_002_fjHa-ha-ha! Och, I'm sorry, but that's too funny! You're brilliant, {PlayerName}, but no one's that skilled.
=
Merida_004_f-Now then, is there anything I can do to help?
J
Merida_005_f:Actually, you can. I stumbled upon something in Everafter.
R
Merida_006_fBIt was a gateway to another trial, just like the ones in Mythopia.
\
Merida_008_fLBut it seems that this one is caused by Maleficent's meddling... not Hades'.
U
Merida_009_fEOh! I found one of those before all that clarty ink flooded the land!
J
Merida_010_f:You mean the one deep in that dark, strange forest, right?
f
Merida_011_fVWell, you'd best be careful, {PlayerName}. There's something not right in those woods.
Å
Merida_012_fqI hear it howling sometimes. It's some sort of beast, like the wolves I used to see stalking the moors back home.
7
Player_001_choice_000_fI'm not afraid of some wolf.
E
Player_001_choice_001_f*We should stick together, just to be safe.
9
Player_001_choice_002_fMaybe it's a friendly wolf...?
h
Merida_013_fXThat's because YOU haven't heard its howls. This isn't a regular old wolf. It's a beast!
`
Merida_016_fPCome on. Let's go <Lore>take a look</Lore>. Together we'll have a better chance.
w
Merida_017_fgAnd I'll keep an arrow at the ready just in case you see something hairy with big teeth coming our way.

Merida_015_fAye. I agree!
a
Merida_014_fQYou haven't heard it howling and snarling. It's a nasty, brutish beast. Trust me.
w
Merida_007_fgIt looked like a kind of gateway, filled with ink. The Lorekeeper told me that it's a Fairy Tale Trial.
r
Merida_003_fbOch, don't worry. If you'd already gotten that mess all sorted, I'd be more than a bit suspicious.
