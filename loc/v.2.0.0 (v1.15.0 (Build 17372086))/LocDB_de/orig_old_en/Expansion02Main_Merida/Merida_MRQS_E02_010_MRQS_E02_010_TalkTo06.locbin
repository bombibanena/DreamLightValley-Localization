Merida_001_fjDid you see that?! The last of the Lorekeeper's magic just flew out of her in those <Lore>Snippets</Lore>!
P
Player_000_f@You mean the little paper bird thingies that flew out of her...?
2
Player_000_choice_000_fThey were sort of cute!
3
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat were those things?!
9
Player_000_choice_002_fAre those things dangerous...?
G
Merida_002_f7Cute?! The skeerie slips are annoying is what they are!
Y
Merida_005_fIThey've been flying all over the Vale ever since the Lorekeeper got sick.
ˆ
Merida_006_fxShe told me they're snippets of her Story Magic come to life. So I'm calling them <ActivityItem>Snippets</ActivityItem>.
g
Merida_007_fWUnless we can catch them all and stuff them back inside the Lorekeeper, she's done for.
¤
Merida_012_f“Only trouble is, they're magic! Which means I can't catch them with my bare hands or shoot them out of the air with an arrow. Trust me, I've tried.
m
Player_001_choice_000_fRMaybe I can catch them. I don't know if you've noticed, but... I'm pretty magical.
y
Player_001_choice_002_f^Have you tried offering them a snack? I would definitely be tricked if you offered me a snack.
f
Player_001_choice_003_fKWell, I guess we're doomed then. Time to give up forever and go take a nap.
µ
Merida_000_f¤About that... I don't mean to insult you, since you seem nice enough, but the Lorekeeper told me that the only way to catch them is with the <Lore>Royal Net</Lore>.
t
Merida_019_fdNow where did I leave that potion...? Must be in my <Lore>bag, which is... somewhere in here</Lore>.
n
Merida_015_f^The Lorekeeper mentioned something about a <Lore>Royal Net</Lore> hidden here in this chamber!
W
Merida_009_fGAye! <Lore>That's exactly what we need</Lore>. She said it was in here?
t
Merida_010_fdThat's perfect! She told me once that only two people can wield its magic... and YOU'RE one of them.
G
Merida_011_f7We've got to find it. Let's <Lore>look around</Lore>...
\
Merida_008_fLOh! Maybe there's something <Lore>underneath all that Petrified Wood</Lore>.
9
Merida_016_f)Maybe my Pickaxe can take care of that...
[
Merida_017_fKPickaxe?! I found <Lore>a potion</Lore> while I was exploring a while back.
[
Merida_018_fKIt's supposed to be for a Pickaxe. And I didn't have a Pickaxe. But YOU do!
ˆ
Merida_014_fxI've tried everything and nothing worked! The Lorekeeper says they can only be captured with the <Lore>Royal Net</Lore>.
†
Merida_013_fvGive up? No member of Clan DunBroch ever gives up! We can solve this. We only need to find <Lore>the Royal Net</Lore>.

Merida_003_f#Wee annoyances are what those were.
T
Merida_004_fDDangerous? I don't think so. But they are annoying, that's for sure.
