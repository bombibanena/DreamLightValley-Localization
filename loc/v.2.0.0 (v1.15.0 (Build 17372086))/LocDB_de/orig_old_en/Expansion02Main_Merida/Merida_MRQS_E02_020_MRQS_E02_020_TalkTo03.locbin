Merida_002_fyNow the Bind looks almost as beautiful as it did back before Maleficent and Hades made such a blooming mess of the place.

Merida_010_fîI guess the secret was hidden inside that room all along. It was a strange place, though, wasn't it? If only the princess herself had been in there.

Player_001_choice_001_fDThe princess seemed to be working on something... something special.
y
Player_001_choice_002_f^I haven't got time to figure out where some princess has run off to on top of everything else.

Merida_011_fDI haven't seen her in ages. I don't think she's in the Bind anymore.

Merida_006_f:But it's such a mess that it's barely a roof over my head.

Å
Merida_012_fqWe'll have to find her to sort out what. But I haven't seen her in ages. I don't think she's in the Bind anymore.
