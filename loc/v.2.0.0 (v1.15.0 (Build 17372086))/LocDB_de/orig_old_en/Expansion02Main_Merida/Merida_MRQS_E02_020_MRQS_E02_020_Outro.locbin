Merida_001_fG{PlayerName}, the Bind feels like it's got a bit of its old magic back!
Ä
Merida_002_fpEverything the Lorekeeper said about you... I wasn't sure if I should believe it, if I should let myself hope...
b
Merida_003_fR...but it's true! Some people are even better than the heroes you find in stories.
Z
Player_000_choice_000_f?I couldn't have done it without you, Merida. You're a hero too.
0
Player_000_choice_001_fAw shucks. Thank you.
m
Player_000_choice_002_fRBut all I did was chase some origami birds around and clean up some spilled ink...
T
Merida_004_fD{PlayerName} and Merida... creators of our own destinies! I like it.
E
Merida_007_f5But we can't rest yet. Our journey's only just begun.
†
Merida_008_fèNext, you'll have to <Lore>get rid of those big walls of ink that are</Lore> stopping us from getting into <Lore>Everafter and Mythopia</Lore>.
8
Player_001_choice_000_fTell me more about Everafter.
7
Player_001_choice_001_fTell me more about Mythopia.
Q
Player_001_choice_002_f6How do I get rid of all the ink? Where should I start?
=
Player_001_choice_003_f"Say no more. I'm ready to do this.
I
Merida_009_f9Well, you'll find Everafter on the west side of the Vale.
£
Merida_010_fíIt's a land made up of fairy tales and fables... or so the Lorekeeper tells me. They're not any fables I know, but they're definitely interesting.
é
Merida_011_f~They've got mushrooms there as big as a house! Oh, but be careful. I've heard howling from over there that's chilled my blood.
Å
Merida_013_fqYou've got to watch out for the <Lore>dragons</Lore> too. They're just wee ones. But their teeth are awful sharp.
\
Merida_014_fLAnd the Snippets over there are different. They're frogs, hopping all about.
a
Merida_015_fQAs soon as you can <Lore>figure out how to reach Maleficent in her castle</Lore>.
d
Merida_046_fTBut watch out for her. She calls herself something daft like "Mistress of All Evil."
x
Merida_048_fhOh, and she can turn into a fire-breathing dragon. A BIG one. You'd best watch out for that nasty trick.
+
Merida_028_fOkay, I'm ready to do this.
U
Merida_026_fEThere's nothing as exciting as setting out on an adventure, is there?
®
Merida_027_fóTo start, <Lore>gather enough Story Magic</Lore> to clear away one of those walls of ink. And remember: I'll always be here if you need a spot of help.
B
Merida_016_f2You'll find Mythopia on the east side of the Vale.
ú
Merida_017_fãThe Lorekeeper told me it's a land made up of myths and legends. Though, truth be told, they're not any myths or legends I'm familiar with.
]
Merida_018_fMThey've got huge marble columns there, and golden fields. It's quite a sight!
u
Merida_019_feOh, and there are some flying creatures too. Wee horses with wings. *gasp* Maybe you could tame one?!
ë
Merida_020_fÄNow, the Snippets over there are the worst of all. They're wee pixie things that fly around and disappear whenever you get near!
ú
Merida_021_fãOf course, you'll have to find some way to scale that huge mountain to reach Mount Olympus if you're ever going to <Lore>find Hades</Lore>.
X
Merida_049_fHAs for Hades... Well, I used to think my hair was fiery until I met him.
_
Merida_050_fOBut he's a blowhard. Flatter him and I don't think he'll give you much trouble.
Ö
Merida_022_fuYou haven't forgotten already, have you? The same way you got rid of the ink that was blocking the way into the Bind.
u
Merida_023_feJust gather up enough Story Magic by explorin' the Bind, clearing away Inkies, and catching Snippets.
=
Merida_024_f-Then focus all that magic at the wall of ink.
p
Merida_025_f`If it were me, I'd <Lore>start with Everafter</Lore>. Convincing Maleficent will take some time.
k
Merida_051_f[And you might even find some other Villagers stranded there who can help you along the way.
,
Merida_005_fNo, thank you, {PlayerName}.
Ç
Merida_006_frAye, but nobody else could do it! Every one of those paper pests you catch is one that's not buzzing about my ear!
