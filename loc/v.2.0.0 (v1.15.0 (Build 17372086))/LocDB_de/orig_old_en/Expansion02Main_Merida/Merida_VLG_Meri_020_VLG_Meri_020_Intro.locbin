Merida_002_f1AHH!!! That good-for-nothing bragging dunderheid!
2
Merida_003_f"I've had just about enough of him.
;
Player_000_choice_000_f Whoa. Who are you talking about?
D
Player_000_choice_001_f)Uhhhh... good luck dealing with all that.
!
Merida_004_fWho do you think?
™
Merida_005_fˆThere might be a couple of good-for-nothing bragging dunderheids around here... but today <Lore>Flynn Rider</Lore> is the worst of them!
F
Player_001_choice_000_f+Flynn's got a good heart underneath it all.
T
Player_001_choice_001_f9I can see how you and Flynn would be like fire and water.
4
Player_001_choice_002_f*sigh* What did Flynn do?
7
Merida_008_f'I know. But he's buried it pretty deep.
Š
Merida_010_fzI was minding my own, practicing in the woods with my bow, when Flynn came along and just had to give me a few "pointers."
B
Player_002_choice_000_f'Maybe he was just trying to be helpful?
Q
Player_002_choice_001_f6I've seen you use that bow. You don't need any advice.
=
Player_002_choice_002_f"I didn't know Flynn was an archer.
<
Merida_012_f,If I needed his help, I'd have asked for it.
Á
Merida_018_f°When I told him, "Thank you, but I don't need your advice," he even had the nerve to say I was holding my bow wrong! I'm the best archer in DunBroch. I know how to hold my bow!
v
Merida_011_ffHe reminds me of one of the lads who tried to shoot for my hand in marriage. All bluster and no skill.
¨
Merida_015_f—I don't suppose you could <Lore>talk to Flynn</Lore> and get through that thick head of his that when it comes to archery, I don't need his "pointers"!
S
Merida_013_fCThank you, {PlayerName}. It would be nice if Flynn understood that.
<
Merida_014_f,{PlayerName}, you've missed the whole point!
3
Merida_009_f#Well, he definitely has me steamed!
p
Merida_006_f`I'll try my best, {PlayerName}, but I'm afraid I might need your help if I can't sort it myself.
.
Merida_007_fI can't take much more of him.
