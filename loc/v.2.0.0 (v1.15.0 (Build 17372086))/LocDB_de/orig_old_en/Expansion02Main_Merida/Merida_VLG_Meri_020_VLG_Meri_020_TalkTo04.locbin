Merida_005_fDid you see that?
W
Merida_006_fGThat numpty couldn't even go two minutes without telling me what to do.
M
Player_000_choice_000_f2There has to be some way for you two to get along.
0
Player_000_choice_002_fYou two are hopeless!
g
Merida_007_fWIf there was only a way you both could get out all this aggression towards one another.
g
Merida_008_fWFlynn's not going to learn his lesson unless I PROVE to him that I don't need his help.
y
Merida_009_fiSay... now there's an idea. When the clans REALLY can't resolve things, they have a sporting competition.
f
Merida_010_fVI was planning to hold a friendly archery contest to show some Villagers how to shoot.
_
Merida_011_fOBut maybe you could convince Flynn to join, and we can make it not so friendly.
=
Player_001_f-An archery competition between you and Flynn?
/
Player_001_choice_000_fThat's a great idea.

Player_001_choice_001_fI don't know about this.
;
Player_001_choice_002_f This sounds EXTREMELY dangerous.
B
Merida_012_f2Flynn will finally see who's the best archer here.
Å
Merida_015_fqI already made some signs to post for the event. Think you could <Lore>put them up around the Vale for me</Lore>?
Q
Merida_016_fAThat braggart Flynn won't be able to resist a chance to show off.
g
Merida_000_fWI'll get on that. I guess you <Lore>could probably use some archery targets</Lore> too.
X
Merida_001_fHThat'd be grand. If you need me, I'll be practicing for the competition.
u
Merida_013_feWhat's the problem? I'll easily defeat Flynn, and he'll think twice before trying to "help" me again.
?
Merida_014_f/I promise. I'LL only be aiming for the targets.
