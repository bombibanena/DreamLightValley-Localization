Player_000_choice_001_fNala would never hurt you!

Player_000_choice_002_f She was just acting on instinct!

Timon_002_fÙSure. But you know how many times it takes to get eaten by a lion? ONCE! ... On the other hand, she IS a main line of defense between us and all the other dangerous stuff out there... Forget what I said. Nala's great!

Timon_003_fyI know. I know. You're right. Sometimes, it's just hard to shake that first impression. But I promise, I'm workin' on it!

Timon_004_f˜That's one dangerous instinct for little guys like us! ... Huh... I think I just had to talk it out. Nala wouldn't hurt us... Hey, thanks, {PlayerName}.
