Timon_023_fGreat! A-A-HEM...

Timon_027_fo"In the distance, a wild beast sits, nibbling on the grass. She waits for her colony to join her. Let's watch."
.
Timon_029_f... What are you talking about?
*
Timon_030_fI'm just gettin' warmed up.
O
Timon_001_f@Now... what exactly do we do with this recording thingamajigger?

Player_000_choice_000_f#We can use it to record your voice!
K
Player_000_choice_001_f0Don't worry about it; I'll handle the recording.

Player_000_choice_002_f"Thingamajigger"? Really?
p
Timon_004_faYou can talk about the critters we're taking pictures of and it will play your voice back to you.
P
Timon_007_fAYa mean, I'll hear myself AFTER I said something? That's amazing!
L
Timon_002_f=Let's get started. Do you know what critters you want to see?
Y
Timon_009_fJWell, you've been here longer than me. Where do you think we should start?
8
Timon_010_f)Hmm. I think we should snap a photo of...
8
Player_001_choice_000_f...something cute and cuddly.
-
Player_001_choice_001_f...a cool reptile.
@
Player_001_choice_002_f%...one of the furry little omnivores.
+
Timon_011_fLike a squirrel or a rabbit!
v
Timon_014_fgBut we definitely want to have a variety of pictures. We want to photograph as many critters as we can!
x
Timon_015_fiOh! I know! What about that little red lizard I've seen walkin' around? You know, the one who talks fast.
)
Timon_016_fLizard? Do you mean Mushu?
J
Timon_017_f;Mushu isn't a critter, Timon. Or a lizard. He's a Guardian!
f
Timon_018_fWEven better! If he's something special, that would add some pizzazz to this production!
.
Player_002_choice_000_fMaybe you're right.
+
Player_002_choice_001_fIf you insist...
6
Player_002_choice_002_fI'm not so sure about that.
5
Timon_019_f&Of COURSE I'm right! I'm always right!
”
Timon_025_f„All right, just so long as you understand he isn't a critter! Mushu is a very well-respected Guardian and should be treated as such.
V
Timon_026_fGYeah, yeah, I got it! Stop worrying so much! This is going to be GREAT.
°
Timon_028_f Okay, I'll go <Lore>take pictures of some critters in Dreamlight Valley... and Mushu.</Lore> While I do that, you can do some more scouting for the documentary.

Timon_020_fTrust me; it's a great idea.
J
Timon_021_f;What's not to be sure about? Trust me; it's gonna be great.

Timon_012_fLike a crocodile or a turtle!
%
Timon_013_fLike a fox or raccoon!
N
Timon_005_f?You're the talent here, Timon. I'll handle the technical stuff.

Timon_008_f/Hey, I'm more than just a pretty face, ya know!

Timon_006_f0What? We don't have these things in the savanna.
