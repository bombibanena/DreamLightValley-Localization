Timon_001_f[Hey, {PlayerName}, did that fancy rock you pointed at Pumbaa show ya anything that'll help?
"
Player_000_fYou mean my phone?
@
Player_000_choice_000_f%Yeah, Pumbaa's REALLY stuck in there.
M
Player_000_choice_002_f2I didn't notice anything, but it was pretty funny.
\
Timon_002_fMWe're gonna need something slippery to apply that might help us pull him out.
M
Timon_004_f>How did you get Pumbaa free from the last log he was stuck in?
á
Timon_005_fxLet me think... Oh yeah! I mashed up some of the greasiest bugs I could find into a special oil, and that got him loose.
&
Timon_006_fCould we do that again?
”
Timon_007_f√I don't see why not. It was pretty complicated, though... I made <Lore>two bug oils</Lore> and then <Lore>combined THOSE oils</Lore> to make a <ActivityItem>Super Slippery Bug Oil</ActivityItem>.
e
Timon_008_fVOkay... I'll start collecting the different types of bugs we need. How do I find them?
ü
Timon_009_fèIt'll be easy for you with that choppy thing of yours. Just <Lore>break rocks around the jungle</Lore> and <Lore>get the bugs under 'em</Lore>.
L
Timon_003_f=Funny but serious, right? We gotta get Pumbaa outta that log!
