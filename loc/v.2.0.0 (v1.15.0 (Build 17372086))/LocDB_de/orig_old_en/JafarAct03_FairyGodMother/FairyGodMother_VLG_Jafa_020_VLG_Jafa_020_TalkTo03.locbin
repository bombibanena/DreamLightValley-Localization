FairyGodMother_001_fPFairy Godmother, do you possibly have a moment to give me a hand with something?
/
FairyGodMother_005_fWhy of course, my dear!
€
FairyGodMother_006_fhPerfect! Jafar and I were hoping to get a bit of help with an alchemical project that we're undertaking.
D
FairyGodMother_007_f,Jafar? Oh my. Isn't he rather... villainous?
7
Player_001_choice_000_fHe's turned over a new leaf!
C
Player_001_choice_001_f(Trust me; I'm watching him, like a hawk.
9
FairyGodMother_008_f!Well, that's certainly good news.
,
FairyGodMother_010_fNow, how can I help?
€
FairyGodMother_000_fhI'm trying to get a hold of the various Essences around here â€” can you share any info that might help?
¹
FairyGodMother_026_f Why, I'd be delighted. I'm certainly no alchemist, but I know a little of the magic here! Shall I first explain the difference between Major and Minor Essences?
%
Player_000_choice_000_f
Please do!
A
Player_000_choice_001_f&I'm good; it's been explained already.
‡
FairyGodMother_027_foWell, a Major Essence is a combination of Minor Essences. And three Minor Essences combine to make a Major one!
]
FairyGodMother_016_fEOh, do you know which ones I might need to help out with the alchemy?
œ
FairyGodMother_024_fƒI suppose you'll need the <ActivityItem>Major Essence of Wishes</ActivityItem>, though I've never been able to extract that myself.
û
FairyGodMother_025_fâBut if you're as clever as I know you to be, you might have better luck. I do believe that one component of the <ActivityItem>Major Essence of Wishes</ActivityItem> is the <ActivityItem>Minor Essence of Fantasy</ActivityItem>.
«
FairyGodMother_017_f’If you can find an object filled with wish magic, you should be able to extract the <ActivityItem>Minor Essence of Fantasy</ActivityItem> from it.
»
FairyGodMother_018_f¢Oh! I recently saw a charmed book flitting about <Lore>Ancient's Landing</Lore>. If you can catch it, I'm sure you can do the extraction without a bit of trouble!
G
FairyGodMother_019_f/Oh that's perfect â€” just what I need. Thanks!
ƒ
FairyGodMother_004_fkI almost forgot! {PlayerName}, has anyone told you about the <ActivityItem>Emotive Essences</ActivityItem>?
2
FairyGodMother_021_fOh, no â€” what are those?
½
FairyGodMother_022_f¤Well, they're rather elusive Essences. You see, they can't be refined from any item or resource. You must perform actions to call them forth from Dreamlight itself.
µ
FairyGodMother_002_fœThe <ActivityItem>Essence of Benevolence</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Essence of Wisdom</ActivityItem> are the most common, but there could be more.
8
FairyGodMother_023_f Oh cool â€” thanks for the info!
:
FairyGodMother_020_f"I'm always happy to help, my dear!
_
FairyGodMother_003_fGNow, why don't you take this? It might be useful to reference it later.
"
FairyGodMother_028_f
Wonderful!
^
FairyGodMother_011_fFWell, we tried to turn Iron into Gold but didn't get much of a result.
X
FairyGodMother_012_f@Do you know of any alchemical Ingredients to improve a reaction?
q
FairyGodMother_013_fYI'm afraid alchemy is not my specialty, dear. Have you tried to find any of the Essences?
6
FairyGodMother_014_fNo, I haven't! What are those?
£
FairyGodMother_015_fŠOh, they are part of the very heart of Dreamlight Valley! You might consider them the shared feelings that make our time here so pleasant.
s
FairyGodMother_009_f[Oh, well, if you have your eye on the situation, then I'm sure all will turn out just fine.
