Hey Rapunzel, can I bother you for something real quick?

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Of course! I mean... you're never a bother, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
A trolley? What's that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh boy, where do I start?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uhh, let's just say it's Oswald's pet and move on from there.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I guess you could say that it's sort of like a horseless carriage that moves on its own.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
It drives around an area in a preset loop, and people can get on and off to get to where they're going faster than just walking.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
And Oswald brought one here? That's amazing!

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
Could I see it?

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Well, uhh... it escaped and we can't find it.

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
The trolley... escaped? I don't understand.

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
And besides, finding the lost trolley is much more important than a few paintings.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Here you go, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Amazing. I owe you one, Rapunzel.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
{PlayerName}, I'm worried for the poor lost trolley!

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Is there anything I can do to help? Are you creating a search party?

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Actually, there is something you can do!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
We wanted to make some "Missing" posters and set them up around Eternity Isle.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Of course! That way you can get everyone on the Island to help.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
And I have some blank canvasses you can use if you want.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
You sure you won't need them?

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
I won't. I've been exploring non-standard canvasses recently. I did an oval painting yesterday, and I'm working on a dodecahedral one now.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Well, I love pets and animal companions.

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Can I see the new trolley and say hello?

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
Um, it's basically a type of machine... and it escaped.
