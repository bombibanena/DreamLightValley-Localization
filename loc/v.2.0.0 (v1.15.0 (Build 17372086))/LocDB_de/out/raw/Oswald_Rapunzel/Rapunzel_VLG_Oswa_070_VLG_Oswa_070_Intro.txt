Hi, Rapunzel! Do you have a moment for a fun little distraction?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Of course, {PlayerName}. I always have time for fun!

In fact, I was just about to offer to reorganize Merlin's library based on colors instead of alphabetically.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How artistic!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Honestly, that's probably more organized than how Merlin's books are now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
My librarian instincts aren't a fan of that idea...

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Oh, but what's the distraction you had in mind? I can wait on my library plans.

And then I'll tell you which set of meals would make for the most colorful still-life painting.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
I'm on it!

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Great! And don't worry; I'll tell Oswald all about his part.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Well, Oswald and I are having a fierce contest.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
How exciting!

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
We need you to give us a task and then judge who did it better.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
All right. Let me think for a moment...

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Okay, I have an idea!

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
I've been thinking about colors a lot lately and how I can make more interesting choices with my art.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
So I've decided to paint a still life.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Here's my challenge: <Lore>Bring me 3 colorful meals</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Hmm... Maybe I should rethink it, then.
