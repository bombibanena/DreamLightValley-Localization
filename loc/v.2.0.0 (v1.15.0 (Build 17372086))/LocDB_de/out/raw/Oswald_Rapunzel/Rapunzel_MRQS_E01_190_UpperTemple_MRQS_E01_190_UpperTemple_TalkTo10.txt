{PlayerName}! I'm so glad you're here! I was just walking in the Tangle feeding my capybara friends when all of a sudden...

...these rips appeared in the sky and things started turning black and white.

I even saw a <Lore>black and white capybara</Lore> run by.

What's happening? Should I get my frying pan?

Jafar tricked me and got ahold of the Spark of Imagination.

Now time's all messed up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Get your frying pan ready...

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Oh... oh no...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
In the meantime, I'll see if that black and white capybara likes black and white food.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I will. Whatever is causing this deserves a good thump!
