Mother Gothel?! What in the world are YOU doing here?!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
What am Iâ You're the one who asked ME to meet!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
I most certainly did not! {PlayerName} practically begged me to come here. I assure you, this was not my idea!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I am not in the habit of sharing confidences with the forces of evil.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Forces of evil? Hardly! Now if you'd said, "forces for charm, wit, and incisive humor," then you'd be absolutely right.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Ha! Your charm serves only to mislead!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
... So you do find me charming?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
What... I... that's... Oh, blast it all! I'm about to give {PlayerName} a piece of my mind! We've been had!
