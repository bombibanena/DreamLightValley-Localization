I took this photo of a pillar Aladdin and I rebuilt out on Ariel's island. Can you tell me anything about it?

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Oh, I love a good artistic mystery!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Well... I can tell you that the art on these is old. VERY old!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
So old that I'm not sure I've ever seen it before... Sorry I can't help you any more than that, {PlayerName}.

Thanks anyway, Minnie!
