Has Antonio found any new animals?

And the whole family's been getting a lot better at talking things through.

When I'm missing my mamÃ¡, I try to cook some of the things she does. Like arepas.

They're not as good as MamÃ¡'s, but they definitely remind me of her.

And if I'm missing my cousin Antonio, I'll sit and listen to the birds or watch the animals.

He's made a lot of new chigÃ¼iro friends lately.

They're great to have around. So chill.
