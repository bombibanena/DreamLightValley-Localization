Oh hey, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
I'm still a little sad about the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>. Not just because it's broken, but because of what it represented.

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
Things just don't feel the same around here.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Then you'll be happy to learn that the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem> is good as new.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
What?!

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Thanks to the efforts of Anna, Elsa, Kristoff and Moana, we're ready to have a real Festival of Friendship, just like before the Forgetting.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Really?! This is amazing!

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
And something tells me you had a lot to do with it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh, I just cooked a little.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I just asked people to help and cooked some meals.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Well, without me there would be no Festival.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
Oh, I'm sure there was more to it than that.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
I'll place the <ActivityItem>Festival of Friendship Table</ActivityItem> near Mini-Casita... and maybe I'll change my outfit to fit this special occasion.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
This is the best surprise ever!

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
Well, thank you!

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
That's right. Always stay humble, {PlayerName}... But seriously, thanks. This is really nice of you.
