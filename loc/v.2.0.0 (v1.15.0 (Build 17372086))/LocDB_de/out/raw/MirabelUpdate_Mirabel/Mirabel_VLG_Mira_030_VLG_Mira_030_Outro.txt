Think I'll just go check on Donald and Mr. McDuck to see how things went.

We did it! Donald and Mr. McDuck forgave each other.

And they only squabbled a little bit about who forgave who first.

I never could've done it without you.

And bonus â I've learned something new. Not all families work like mine.

Just because something helped me and Isabela get along doesn't mean it works for Donald and Mr. McDuck.
