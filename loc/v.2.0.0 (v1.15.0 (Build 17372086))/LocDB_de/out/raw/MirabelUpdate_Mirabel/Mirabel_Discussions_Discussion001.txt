Have I ever told you about my TÃ­o Bruno?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's he like?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He can see the future, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I thought you didn't talk about him?

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Well, some people think he's odd. But I love all the odd things about him.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
He really likes the color green. And rats. And the rats like him back.

You know, I bet he'd love to meet Remy. Oh! And write a telenovela series about him â Â¡La pasiÃ³n de la rata chef!

For a long time my family didn't talk about Bruno, but now I make sure to tell everyone how amazing he is!

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Yes! That's his gift. It's really powerful, but it can be a little complicated.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Sometimes the future has problems in it. And people don't want to hear that.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
You know, now that I think about it, he and Merlin would have a lot to talk about.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Not anymore! I talk about him as much as I can.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
I never want people not to talk about Bruno again.
