*yawn* Where am I? How long have I been asleep?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was my pleasure.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're welcome.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It was totally worth all the work.

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Wait...

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Am I back in the Valley?! It looks so much better!

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
And someone made all that darkness go away...

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
You! You must be the one who did that! Â¡Felicidades!

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
I'm so glad to be back.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Where were you?

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
I'm not sure. It was strange, and everything looked... frozen in time. I woke up once to drink a glass of water, but I was so tired, I went straight back to bed.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
I'm guessing you're the one I should thank for bringing me back...?

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
That's really nice of you to say.

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
Something tells me we're gonna be great neighbors.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
Woo! I am so happy to see this Valley!

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
Before the Forgetting, it was full of friends, happiness and so much laughter. Everyone helped each other, just like they do in my Encanto.

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
I really loved it here.

TAG: Mirabel_014_f
That's why I was so sad to see people forget and leave. And then when that darkness fell over everything...

TAG: Mirabel_015_f
But now, the darkness is gone, there's Dreamlight shining on everything again, and I'm back!

TAG: Mirabel_016_f
I can already tell that you're doing amazing stuff here. I can't wait to see what happens next.

TAG: Mirabel_017_f
Well, don't worry. I'm a super-hard worker. Happy to help with anything you need!
