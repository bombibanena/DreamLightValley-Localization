So how did it go with Mister McDuck? Is he still mad?

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
He was happy to get his <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> back. He still seemed a bit mad at Donald, though.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
I just wish they could get along like they used to. Sure, they'd have the occasional quarrel, but nothing like this.

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
I have so many family photos of them from before the Forgetting...

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Wait...

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Photos! That's it! I'll find a happy photo of them in my album, make a frame, then maybe if we brought them together for a nice dinner, andâ

TAG: Player_000_f
Whoa! Slow down. How about you find the photo, and I'll make the meal and the frame...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I want to be part of solving this too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It'll give you time to find the perfect photo.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't want you to go overboard again.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
That would be great! You know what they say: the more the merrier.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Maybe the frame could be themed to something they both love?

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
Well, Donald lives on a boat and Scrooge McDuck is a renowned adventurer so maybe... a <ActivityItem>Seashell Frame</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
I should put <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Clams</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Scallops</ActivityItem> together to make it.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
That would totally work, {PlayerName}! And for the meal, I think we should go with something they can share, like... a <ActivityItem>Fruit Pie</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
Here, I just read about it in this <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem> I borrowed from Remy.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
Great idea, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
Yeah... I tend to do that, don't I? Hopefully, if we work together, we'll get it just right. Hmm...
