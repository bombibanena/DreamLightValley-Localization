{PlayerName}! You found everything! Thank you!

Oh! These tiles are just like the ones you use for your floor.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
Yep! You can use them in your House if you want to.

I'm so glad we got to fix up Mini-Casita. Caring for your House is an important part of turning it into a home, don't you think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Absolutely.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I never thought about it that much.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No, not really.

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
And your timing's perfect. I know just how I want it all to look.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Let me give you a hand. It'll go faster if we work together.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
You're the best!

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
You know, this reminds me of when the people of our Encanto came together to help my family rebuild Casita. It meant so much to all of us.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
And it really means a lot to me that you're offering to help. If you're ready... Let's do this!

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Â¡Me encanta! It's so much better! Â¡Muchas gracias!

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
I couldn't have done it without you. Which is why I want you to have this.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
I should put even more love into my House.

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
I bet you'll be really happy if you do. And, just so you know, I'd love to help.

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
I could add a couple of things to my place. Scrooge McDuck might have what I need.

TAG: Mirabel_014_f
And if he doesn't, you can always place an order. I've heard it's pretty easy.

TAG: Mirabel_015_f
But you might have a point. Maybe I should put some more love into my House.

TAG: Mirabel_016_f
Well, I would love to help you do that!
