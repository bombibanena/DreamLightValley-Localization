Hey, {PlayerName}... Do you have some time to help me with Mini-Casita?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What seems to be the issue?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe later.

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Nothing major, but there's some damage from the time we spent... wherever it was it took me to protect me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Of course, I'll help you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Is it safe for you to live in there?

Shouldn't a magical house be able to repair itself?

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Great! Let's go to Mini-Casita. It'll be easier to show you.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Oh, it's totally safe. Don't worry. You'll see what I'm talking about when we get there. C'mon; let's go to Mini-Casita.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Well... sometimes, magic needs a little love and elbow grease to work.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Let's go to Mini-Casita, and I'll show you what has to be fixed.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
No problem! I'll be around whenever you can.
