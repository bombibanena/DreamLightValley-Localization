Did you find the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>? Please say yes.

TAG: Player_000_f
I did, but it's broken into pieces...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sorry, Mirabel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you know what happened?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This is why you don't climb on furniture.

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Oh... Well, that's all right...

I guess when everyone left, it was forgotten there and got swept away by the tides.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Like all those memories of our friendship. Maybe this was all a bad idea. Maybe you can't recapture something that's lost like that...

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
It's not a bad idea, Mirabel. Just... give me a day or two. I think I can fix this. I just have to talk to some people.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
No, I have no idea.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Hey! I don't climb onâ Never mind. I'm sure that's not what happened.
