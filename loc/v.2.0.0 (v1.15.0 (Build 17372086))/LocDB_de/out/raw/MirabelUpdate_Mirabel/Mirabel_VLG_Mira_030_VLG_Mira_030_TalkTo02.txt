So... how are Mr. McDuck and Donald feeling?

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
They both just need to calm down a little. I think if we could get Mr. McDuck's <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> back, it would all be okay.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
That's perfect!

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Oh, and could we also do something for the raccoons in the Forest of Valor, too? Donald really scared them with all that yelling.

TAG: Player_000_f
Maybe I can look around for the <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> and feed the raccoons...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I love those little creatures.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
But they're really hard to approach.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Even if they hate me.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Me too! But I don't think everyone around here understands them.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
You have to be super patient. They get nervous when they sense a stranger nearby. So, you have to watch their stance.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
If they're on their hind legs, don't move or they'll flee. You can approach when they are sitting, but stop moving if they're about to get up again.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
Oh, and they really like berries!

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
How do you know so much about raccoons...?

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
My cousin Antonio loves animals. His gift is that he can understand them, and he taught me what to look for.

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
I'll bring the <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> to Scrooge. By now, the raccoon has probably buried it. I'll have to dig around...

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
They are at first, but I think I've figured them out.

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
No, they don't hate you! They're just really wary of strangers.
