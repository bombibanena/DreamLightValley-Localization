When the weather's like this, I always think of my TÃ­a Pepa.

Why is that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is her gift being able to predict the weather?

I bet her gift has to do with the weather.

TÃ­a Pepa's gift is that her moods can change the weather.

It's really easy to tell how she's feeling. You just have to look up!

Close! But not quite.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
You're right! Her moods can change the weather.

So when the sky looks like this, I can't help but think... I hope TÃ­a Pepa's okay.
