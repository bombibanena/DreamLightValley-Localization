{PlayerName}, I'm sorry to bother you but I think...

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
Well, I think the Forgetting took a memory from me. An important one. And I could use some help getting it back.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh no, what was it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I promise I'll help you, but not right now.

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
It's a recipe. You see, I was thinking that since we're back in the Village, and more and more people are coming back to the Valley...

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
...that calls for a celebration! And I have the perfect food for it. <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Except, I can't remember the recipe to give to Remy. I can barely even remember what they taste like.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
No matter how hard I concentrate, there's nothing but emptiness in my head where it was supposed to be.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Like it's been erased or taken... somehow.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
And it's my mamÃ¡'s recipe. Losing it is like losing a part of me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sure we can find it together!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You don't remember anything about it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Are you sure you're not just distracted?

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Oh, I'm so glad you'll help. And I've got an idea where we can start. Somehow the magic of Mini-Casita kept a fresh plate of them in the cupboard all this time.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
Maybe we could do a taste test? See if we can figure out what ingredients go into them.

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
Though, I'm not nearly as good a cook as MamÃ¡. She's a true artist. Not to mention, her meals can heal you. Literally.

TAG: Mirabel_011_f
Give me the plate. I'll ask Remy. He's the real food expert around here.

TAG: Mirabel_012_f
Great idea! Here you go!

TAG: Mirabel_013_f
No, but I still have a plate of them. Somehow the magic of Mini-Casita kept them fresh in the cupboard all this time. Maybe we could do a taste test? See if we can figure out what ingredients go into them.

TAG: Mirabel_014_f
No way. It's my mamÃ¡'s recipe, and I can't even remember the taste. That's not something I'd forget just like that... But the important part is that I think I know how to figure it out.

TAG: Mirabel_017_f
I understand. I'll be around. Please come see me as soon as you can.
