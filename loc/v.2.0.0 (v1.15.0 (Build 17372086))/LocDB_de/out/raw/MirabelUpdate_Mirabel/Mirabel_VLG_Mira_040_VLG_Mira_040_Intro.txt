{PlayerName}, I found something kind of strange in my House, and I could use your help. Can you spare a minute?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Another mystery to solve? Sure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't just yet.

Okay, so this <ActivityItem>Torn Cloth</ActivityItem> just flew out from under a counter! The lights started flickering, the wood planks of the floor brought it closer to me...

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Mini-Casita wanted to be SURE that I saw it.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
It looks familiar, but I can't place it. I KNOW it's gotta be important. Think you can help?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm here for you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What do you need?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
My help? With a torn cloth?

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}! That means a lot.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Could you take a look at the <ActivityItem>Torn Cloth</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
See if you notice anything strange about it. And by anything, I mean ANYTHING.

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
Okay, give it to me; I'll examine it.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Here you go.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
Yeah, I know it probably sounds a little... weird. But can you take a look at it?

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
I understand. Whenever you have time would be great.
