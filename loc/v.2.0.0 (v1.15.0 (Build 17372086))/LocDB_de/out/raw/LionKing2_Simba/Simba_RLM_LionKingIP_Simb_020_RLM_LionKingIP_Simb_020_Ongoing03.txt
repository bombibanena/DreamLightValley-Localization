Oh, hey there. Did you find Timon and Pumbaa?

TAG: Simba_001_f
I did... but Timon said I'm too stressed out. So I agreed to hakuna matata lessons and I'm making my own mane <Lore>with stuff from the Realm</Lore>.

TAG: Simba_002_f
I mean, after I <Lore>collect what I need to build my own Crafting Station there</Lore>.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Heh. That sounds like Timon. Thanks for doing all of this.
