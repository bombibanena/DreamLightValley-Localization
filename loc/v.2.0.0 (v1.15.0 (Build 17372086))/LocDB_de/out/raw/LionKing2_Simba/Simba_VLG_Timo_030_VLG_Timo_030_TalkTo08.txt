So Timon's having a bit of a hard time with his Timon Talk, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He's been working so hard...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He doesn't really know what he's doing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He needs a nudge in the right direction.

TAG: Simba_001_f
I'm not surprised. When Timon gets an idea, he's all in!

TAG: Simba_006_f
It might not seem like it, but Timon is really brave. When push comes to shove, he'll put himself on the line for his friends.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Would you say that's how he helped you out on your own journey?

TAG: Simba_002_f
Yeah. He stood by my side during the hardest days of my life. He taught me how to relax but also how to be a loyal and true friend.

TAG: Simba_003_f
He just needs to be reminded of that.

TAG: Simba_004_f
I think he just needs a reminder about how he actually helped me back then.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I think you're right.
