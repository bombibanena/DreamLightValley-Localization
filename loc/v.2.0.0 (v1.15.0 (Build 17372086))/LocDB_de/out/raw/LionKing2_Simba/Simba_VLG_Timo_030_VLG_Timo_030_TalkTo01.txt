Hey, {PlayerName}! I heard you've been helping Timon with something.

TAG: Simba_001_f
I am, and it's going to be spectacular!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
At least Timon insists it will be.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm SO excited!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Well... we're TRYING to make it spectacular, anyway.

TAG: Simba_002_f
If I know Timon, I'm sure he has some pretty big plans.

TAG: Simba_005_f
The idea is... Timon remembers how you overcame so much and learned to embrace being king. Now he wants to help others around Dreamlight Valley find that same confidence!

TAG: Simba_006_f
That's great! He's really starting to find his place here, isn't he?

TAG: Simba_007_f
Definitely. So will you come to the talk? It wouldn't be the same without you there!

TAG: Simba_008_f
I wouldn't miss it!

TAG: Simba_003_f
I can't wait to hear about it!

TAG: Simba_004_f
Timon always knows how to make a scene... In a good way.
