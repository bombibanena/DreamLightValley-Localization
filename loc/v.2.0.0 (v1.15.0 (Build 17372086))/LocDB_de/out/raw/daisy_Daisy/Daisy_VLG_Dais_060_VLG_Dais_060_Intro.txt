{PlayerName}, what would you say to throwing a party to celebrate our amazing Village?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's celebrate!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe later.

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Fantastic, I was hoping you'd say that!

TAG: Daisy_005_f
The way I see it, you can throw a party for just about any reason.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Big events, little wins â everything should be celebrated!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes! Exactly!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I mostly celebrate big events.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'd love to celebrate, but parties feel overwhelming.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Wow, we really are similar! I'm so glad we see eye to eye.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
Now, I've already done most of the planning, so there are just a few final details to take care of. I ordered the <ActivityItem>Gala Banquet</ActivityItem> from Remy.

TAG: Daisy_011_f
Would you be a doll and get it for me? I have to put the finishing touches on the gala's secret, surprise location!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'll do it!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Your excitement is amazing.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Another day, another errand...

TAG: Daisy_001_f
You're an absolute peach!

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Please <Lore>talk to Remy</Lore> as soon as you can.

TAG: Daisy_000_f
Well, I just LOVE throwing parties. I can't help it! And why would I? Oh, and about that <ActivityItem>Gala Banquet</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, I know how hard you work. I want this gala to celebrate all you've accomplished since you came to the Valley, too.

TAG: Daisy_016_f
It's just one itty-bitty favor before the event begins, promise!

TAG: Daisy_008_f
I understand that. You want to make the big things count. So do I. But I also think the little things deserve celebrating too. Like how nice the Village looks, the fact that we're together... Everything!

TAG: Daisy_009_f
Oh, don't worry. I'll make sure the music isn't too loud and that it's not too crowded. This will be a beautiful get-together with friends.

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Just don't wait too long. I have fabulous plans!
