Thanks for bringing these to me, {PlayerName}! Ooh, I can't wait to see what the letters say. It's time to help some Villagers!

TAG: Daisy_000_f
Let's see... *mumbling* You get grape juice out of linen with seltzer...

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Befriend rabbits with fresh carrots, obviously... Give me a challenge... Ah-ha! Here we go.

TAG: Daisy_008_f
{PlayerName}, most of these require simple advice. But I think two of them need direct action.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Aren't they supposed to be anonymous?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sounds... intrusive.

TAG: Daisy_009_f
Of course you can!

TAG: Daisy_013_f
Now, our first "Ask Daisy" challenges are... Drumroll please...

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Vanellope and Kristoff!

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Vanellope wrote you a letter? What does she want?

TAG: Daisy_016_f
Her letter says she wants to "take my game to the next level and be a total boss." (Just like yours truly, I bet.)

TAG: Daisy_017_f
It's obvious what she needs...

TAG: Daisy_018_f
...a new wardrobe that helps her feel confident and powerful!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What a great idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You want to make over VANELLOPE?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You know Vanellope is all about comfy, right?

TAG: Daisy_019_f
I'm so glad you agree.

TAG: Daisy_022_f
Okay... So <Lore>new wardrobe</Lore> for Vanellope... What about Kristoff?

TAG: Daisy_023_f
He wants to do something romantic for Anna and is wondering which flowers to pick.

TAG: Daisy_024_f
The answer, of course, is ALL of them... And chocolate too. One of the many things Anna and I have in common.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
"Yes" to big gestures!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Kristoff is a little more reserved...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Anna DOES like chocolate!

TAG: Daisy_025_f
A fellow romantic. I knew it.

TAG: Daisy_028_f
What do you need me to do?

TAG: Daisy_029_f
Let's talk to Minnie about designing a "BOSS" dress for Vanellope.

TAG: Daisy_030_f
As for Kristoff, could you make sure that Arendelle Castle is surrounded by flowers and prepare lots of chocolate meals for Anna?

TAG: Daisy_031_f
Oh, and when you're done, please check the <ActivityItem>Advice Box</ActivityItem>. There might be more letters!

TAG: Daisy_026_f
Well, this can help him break out of his shell. Anna will love it!

TAG: Daisy_027_f
What do you think? A chocolate fountain? A statue of them dancing together MADE of chocolate?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
If only! That would be adorable!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Let's think less showy... like Kristoff.

TAG: Daisy_003_f
You're right. In fact, I might want to save that as a Valentine's Day surprise for Donald. We need to refocus!

TAG: Daisy_002_f
Hm. All right... Here's the plan.

TAG: Daisy_020_f
Sometimes it doesn't need to be complicated. A new wardrobe IS the next level; trust me!

TAG: Daisy_021_f
I'm very comfortable in my clothes, thank you very much. Looking your best and feeling great don't have to be separate things.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
Some are. Some sign their names. And sometimes I can just tell â we are a fairly small Village after all.

TAG: Daisy_011_f
Oh no, don't worry. When we're done, they'll thank us!
