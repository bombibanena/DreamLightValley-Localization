Fabulous! You're here!

TAG: Daisy_004_f
There are a couple of things I think I should remind you of...

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Before the Forgetting, you had a place where you shared your amazing creativity and personal style.

TAG: Daisy_008_f
It was called the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem>! A shop filled with stylish custom creations for everyone!

TAG: Daisy_009_f
That sounds amazing.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
It really was... I loved it, and I was determined to protect it.

TAG: Daisy_011_f
So when the Forgetting started, I went to see the Fairy Godmother for help.

TAG: Daisy_013_f
She shrunk the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem> to make it pocket-sized, and I hid it here, in my House.

TAG: Daisy_001_f
And today's the day I finally get to give the Boutique back to you!

TAG: Daisy_018_f
Don't we need to make it big again? I can't just eat a cookie and make myself small.

TAG: Daisy_019_f
Of course you can't, silly.

TAG: Daisy_020_f
But you can make the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem> bigger with a <ActivityItem>Wonderland Amplification Elixir</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Daisy_021_f
What are the Ingredients?

TAG: Daisy_022_f
The recipe mentions <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Topaz</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>White Daisies</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Daisy_023_f
Once you've crafted the <ActivityItem>Wonderland Amplification Elixir</ActivityItem>, you can apply it to your Royal Watering Can.

TAG: Daisy_024_f
Then you just have to water the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds simple enough.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
And it will grow back and appear in the Village by itself?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
But won't it grow back INSIDE your House?

TAG: Daisy_026_f
When that's done, just take it and place it in the Valley.

TAG: Daisy_027_f
Not by itself. You'll have to pick it up and place it on the ground. THEN the magic will take effect.

TAG: Daisy_028_f
Nope! The magic is much smarter than that. The Boutique will only grow back when you place it in the Valley.

TAG: Daisy_000_f
The Old Ruler has been gone a long time, but I know they'd want the spirit of creativity to live on in the Valley.

TAG: Daisy_002_f
That's why I'm giving the Boutique to you!

TAG: Daisy_012_f
So when the Forgetting started, I went to see someone who makes dreams come true!

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Dreams come true? I'm not sure I've met this Villager yet...

TAG: Daisy_016_f
Don't worry â things are getting better every day. I'm sure you will soon!

TAG: Daisy_017_f
Anyway, she used her magic to shrink the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem> and make it pocket-sized. I hid it here, in my House, for safekeeping!

TAG: Daisy_005_f
There are a couple of things you need to know.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Before the Forgetting, there was a place where the Old Ruler shared their creativity and personal style.
