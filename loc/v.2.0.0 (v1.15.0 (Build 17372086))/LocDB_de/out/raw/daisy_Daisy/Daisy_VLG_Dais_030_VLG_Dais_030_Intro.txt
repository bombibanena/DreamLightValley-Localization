{PlayerName}, I have a fabulous idea for the Valley that I just have to tell you about!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm all ears.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Some other time.

TAG: Daisy_002_f
Hooray! Okay, by now, you know that I like to keep busy and tackle new challenges.

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Well, I have a new-old idea.

TAG: Daisy_005_f
"Ask Daisy."

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
New-old idea? Explain please.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Ask Daisy what?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Speaking about yourself in the third person? Really?

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Before the Forgetting, we had a Village newspaper: the Dreamlight Gazette. It had news, lifestyle, editorials...

TAG: Daisy_001_f
I loved it all, but my favorite section was the advice column: "Ask Daisy."

TAG: Daisy_010_f
I want to bring back the Gazette and "Ask Daisy" â that's where you come in. Everyone knows you run things around here now.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
This just in: I'm excited!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Where do we start?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Do you ever relax?

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Ha-ha-ha-ha! I knew I could count on you, {PlayerName}. We're kindred spirits.

TAG: Daisy_012_f
First things first: Could you build us an <ActivityItem>Advice Box</ActivityItem> so the Villagers can write in with their questions?

TAG: Daisy_013_f
So glad you asked!

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Of course! I schedule it every day in my very packed and very purple day planner. Now...

TAG: Daisy_008_f
Hold on. I'm getting there...

TAG: Daisy_003_f
All right, but I promise this is exciting!
