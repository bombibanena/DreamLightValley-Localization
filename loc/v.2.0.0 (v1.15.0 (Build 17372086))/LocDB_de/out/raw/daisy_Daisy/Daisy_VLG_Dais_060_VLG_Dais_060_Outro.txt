Thank you so much, {PlayerName}. You were instrumental in cracking the case of the glittered gala.

TAG: Daisy_011_f
Minnie and I are working on a big article about the gala, the prank, and your investigative work for the Dreamlight Gazette.

And I think Vanellope and Stitch will think twice before pranking again.

I'm glad you forgave them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You really think they'll stop?

I would've gone for revenge.

TAG: Daisy_005_f
If there's anything I've learned, you can be reasonable and passionate. You just need to know when to be which.

TAG: Daisy_009_f
I gotta know â what do you have in mind for them?

TAG: Daisy_010_f
I want them to help Minnie and me announce our next collection for Dots & Daisies! It's going to be a fabulous show.

TAG: Daisy_013_f
Speaking of which â here. Take this as a thank-you. You're the first to have it in the Valley â a Dots & Daisies custom design.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
We tried to capture your kindness AND your elegance. I hope you like it.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Hard to say, but I plan to put their talent to good use.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Well, sometimes the best revenge is helping someone see their true potential.
