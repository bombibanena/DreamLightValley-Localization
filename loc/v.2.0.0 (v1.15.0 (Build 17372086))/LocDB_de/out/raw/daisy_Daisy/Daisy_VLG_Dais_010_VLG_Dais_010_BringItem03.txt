Oh! {PlayerName}, you brought the <ActivityItem>Mochas</ActivityItem>! You're so sweet.

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Thank you for bringing them. But as you can see, our housewarming date has been ruined.

TAG: Player_000_f
I already talked to Donald...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can you tell me, in your words, what happened?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's really on edge.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
You know, I'm not even sure what's going on. One second Donald was hammering two boards together...

TAG: Daisy_008_f
...the next he was flying across the room breaking everything in his path!

TAG: Daisy_009_f
I'm afraid I lost my temper before I even asked what happened. He must be pretty mad at me.

TAG: Daisy_011_f
I think he's embarrassed. He told me he hit his hand with a hammer, and that's when things went wrong.

TAG: Daisy_003_f
What really matters is what happens next â why don't we start by tidying up the House?

TAG: Daisy_012_f
Oh, that would be fantastic! Thank you for being such a good friend, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
He does his best, but somehow this always seems to happen.

TAG: Daisy_002_f
It was going so well. We were reminiscing, laughing... And then we decided to build this wardrobe together.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
And then...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Let me guess: Donald with a hammer is a whacking-ly bad idea?

TAG: Daisy_013_f
It all happened so fast. One second Donald was hammering two boards together...

TAG: Daisy_014_f
...the next he was flying across the room breaking everything in his path!

TAG: Daisy_015_f
I'm afraid I lost my temper before I even asked what happened. I just wanted our date to be perfect... He must be pretty mad at me.

TAG: Daisy_019_f
I have a feeling Donald's more upset with himself. Let me go talk to him, okay?

TAG: Daisy_016_f
*giggle* Oh {PlayerName}, don't joke at a time like this!
