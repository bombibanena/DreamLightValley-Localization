There you go, Daisy; all you need for some Hades merch!

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Oh goody, goody! I certainly don't agree with the direction Hades wants to take with his merchandise...

TAG: Daisy_002_f
But the T-shirts will be super quick to produce.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, I guess nobody told Hades about the designer triad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He should really listen to your advice.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think the T-shirts will be cool!

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Nope. He picked "quick" and "cheap," so I better not hear about "quality" later on.

A pic in <Lore>the Elysian Fields, the Fiery Plains, and the Statues' Shadow</Lore> should do it.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
You got it!

TAG: Daisy_004_f
If he does, I've got your back!

TAG: Daisy_008_f
Now, I'll just put the picture on the shirts...

TAG: Daisy_009_f
There we go!

TAG: Daisy_010_f
Great! What are the next steps for Hades, then?

TAG: Daisy_011_f
We need to get folks excited about the shirts!

TAG: Daisy_012_f
Why don't you <Lore>model it for Hades and then take some promotional pictures with him</Lore>?

TAG: Daisy_005_f
I agree!

TAG: Daisy_006_f
But dealing with difficult celebrities is all part of being a manager.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Well, I'll certainly do my best.
