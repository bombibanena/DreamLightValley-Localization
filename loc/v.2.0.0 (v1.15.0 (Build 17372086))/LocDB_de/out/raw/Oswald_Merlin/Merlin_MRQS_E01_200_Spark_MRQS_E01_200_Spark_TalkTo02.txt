Why, hello!

TAG: Merlin_000_f
It, er... it seems you have found the Spark of Imagination.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Merlin! I was just gonna go find you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Phewf! It's just you. Scared me for a second.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
How'd you get down here so quickly...?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
No need. No need. For I, Merlin, have used one of my pedestrian parlor tricks to find you first.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Now then, hand the Spark of Imagination over to me. I must do some of my endless research upon it.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
And I solemnly swear, I will keep it safe from that nefarious, cunning, and devilishly handsome Jafar.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Here you go!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Something about this doesn't seem right...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
If you're really Merlin, what are your magic words?

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Once again, you prove to be an utter fool!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Oh, come now. It is I, your magical mentor. Have I ever steered you wrong before?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
I don't know...

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Stop being foolish. If you will not give the Spark to me...

TAG: Merlin_012_f
...then I shall simply take it!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
My... my magic words?

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Do not be foolish. We both know precisely what my magic words are.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Okay then. Let's hear them.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Higity...

TAG: Merlin_018_f
...figity?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Huh. That SOUNDS right. Here you go!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That didn't sound right at all. Try again.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
So you're totally Jafar in disguise, huh?

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Er, uh... wait. I misspoke.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
I of course meant...

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Flippitus... floppitus?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
That seems right. Here you go!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
That seems even more wrong. Try again.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Okay, you are DEFINITELY Jafar in disguise.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Er... uh...

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Zim zaba rim bim!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
That seems right. Here you go!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
That's enough of this charade, Jafar.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
That is DEFINITELY wrong. Try again.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Jafar?! Bah! What a PREPOSTEROUS accusation.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
I am afraid I must come to a sad conclusion.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
The Forgetting has made me forget my magic words.

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
That makes sense. Here you go.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
Oh, come on, Jafar. Give it up!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
There is no need to fear. It is merely I, Merlin, as I am sure you can tell from this unnecessarily voluminous white beard and impractical hat.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
How did I get down here...? Why, I am Merlin. I simply used one of my pedestrian parlor tricks to appear before you.
