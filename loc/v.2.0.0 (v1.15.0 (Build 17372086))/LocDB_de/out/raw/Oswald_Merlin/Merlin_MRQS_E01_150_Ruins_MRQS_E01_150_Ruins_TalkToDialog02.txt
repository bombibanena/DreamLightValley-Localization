How curious... Do you see this, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
I believe that's... well, it's <Lore>a trap door</Lore>!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It wouldn't be an adventure without a trap door.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
There must be something cool under there.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Guess I should avoid stepping there?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Heh-heh... Yes, it's quite a classic.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I'm certain that what we seek lies beneath us.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
So, we must find some way to open this door. I'll keep examining it for clues. Perhaps you could try <Lore>investigating the other chambers</Lore> on this level.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I noticed some sort of <Lore>ancient technological device</Lore> in the North Chamber...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
...a <Lore>strange pedestal</Lore> in the West Chamber...

TAG: Merlin_010_f
...and a <Lore>display of music notes</Lore> in the East Chamber.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
You got it. I'll <Lore>bring you a picture</Lore> of anything I find.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Ah, it's not merely "cool"...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Quite the contrary!
