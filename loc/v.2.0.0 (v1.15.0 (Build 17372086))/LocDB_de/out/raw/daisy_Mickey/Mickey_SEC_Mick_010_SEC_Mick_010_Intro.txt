Oh boy, {PlayerName}, do I have news for you!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
I opened up my mailbox this morning and found a sparkly purple envelope addressed to both Minnie and me...

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Sparkly? Purple? Who was the letter from?

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Our pal Daisy Duck! I knew it the second I saw the envelope.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
She left the Village to investigate the Forgetting. Daisy said getting to the bottom of it was more important than anything...

TAG: Mickey_017_f
...and that she'd be back with the biggest news story the Valley's ever seen!

TAG: Player_000_f
So what did the letter say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She sounds so brave!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is she in danger?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is she lost?

TAG: Mickey_009_f
She sure is. And her letter says she's found out something big about the Forgetting, and she's ready to return to the Valley!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
She wrote ahead to ask if we could make sure <Lore>her House is in great shape</Lore>. Gosh, I can't blame her. She's been on one LONG camping trip!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll set up Daisy's House right away!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Extended camping trip? Sounds like fun!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Who needs camping when you have the mall?

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Hot dog! Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Let me know if you need any help <Lore>getting Daisy's House ready</Lore>.

TAG: Mickey_000_f
Welp, I'm sure you and Daisy'll have plenty to talk about when she gets back.

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Actually, Daisy likes shopping almost as much as she likes investigations and adventure! You two'll have plenty to talk about.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
No, nothing like that. Her letter said she found out something about the Forgetting during her adventures, and now she's ready to come back to the Valley.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
No, nothing like that. In fact, she's on her way back! It's all in her letter.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
But Minnie's still missing... Who's sending her mail?

TAG: Mickey_007_f
It's from our best pal, Daisy Duck. She wouldn't know that Minnie's disappeared because Daisy's been away for a long time.
