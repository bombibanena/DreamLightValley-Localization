Huh? What's all this?

TAG: Player_000_f
Remy wanted you to try some fine dining.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's gotta beat grubs, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not sure you'll like it better than an antelope.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I prefer fast food myself.

TAG: Simba_001_f
I don't know. I learned to like grubs a lot when I was living with Timon and Pumbaa.

TAG: Simba_006_f
Well, I'll try anything once. Here goes!

TAG: Simba_007_f
Huh... that tasted...

TAG: Simba_008_f
Interesting... But hey, I didn't love grubs the first time I ate those either.

TAG: Simba_009_f
I'll need to try some more. And I'll bring some to Nala and see what she thinks too.

TAG: Simba_010_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Simba_002_f
Me neither. But I've been surprised by trying new things in the past.

TAG: Simba_004_f
I never would've thought I'd like grubs until Timon and Pumbaa got me into them.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Fast food? You mean like zebras? They're pretty fast.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I meant more like some fries and a large soda... you know what, forget about it.
