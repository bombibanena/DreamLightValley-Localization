You want to know what happened when I was on my quest to stop the Forgetting with Kristoff?

TAG: Donald_001_f
You bet! I'll tell you all about my heroism!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's hear it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh boy...

TAG: Donald_002_f
One dark and stormy night, we were camping out on the Sunlit Plateau... Suddenly we saw a huge shadow on the wall of the cliff! It had wings as big as a house!

TAG: Donald_003_f
Right. Kristoff told me already. It was a hummingbird.

TAG: Donald_004_f
A hummingbird! Don't be ridiculous. That wasn't a hummingbird!

TAG: Donald_005_f
It was a two-headed, fifty-foot tall, fire-breathing dragon!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Wow! That's amazing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We don't have those in Dreamlight Valley...

TAG: Donald_006_f
What's more amazing is how I fought it off with just my own two hands.

TAG: Donald_007_f
Next, we went to the Forgotten Lands, where things got even worse...

TAG: Donald_008_f
Right. Kristoff told me you fell in a puddle and a frog jumped out.

TAG: Donald_009_f
What?! No! That's not what happened.

TAG: Donald_010_f
A giant chasm opened up underneath me, then a sea monster grabbed me and tried to drag me in!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Wow! That's scary!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Uhhh... huh...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Forgive me if I have trouble believing this.

TAG: Donald_011_f
Aw, I wasn't scared.

TAG: Donald_012_f
I fought that sea monster off and saved Kristoff too!

TAG: Donald_013_f
After that, we went to the Forest of Valor and... a horrible, evilâ Oh wait. You know the rest.

TAG: Donald_014_f
None of that is even close to what Kristoff told me...

TAG: Donald_015_f
Well, then, his memory must still be messed up. That's exactly how it happened!

TAG: Donald_016_f
If you don't believe me, then go ask Kristoff! He'll tell you all about it!

TAG: Donald_017_f
What?! It's all true!

TAG: Donald_018_f
Not anymore we don't! Not after I fought that one off with my own two hands!
