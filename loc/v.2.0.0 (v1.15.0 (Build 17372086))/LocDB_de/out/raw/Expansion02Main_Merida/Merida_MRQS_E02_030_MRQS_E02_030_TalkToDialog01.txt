There it is, {PlayerName}. The gateway to a Fairy Tale Trial.

The Lorekeeper told me all about them, but I could never manage to get inside one.

TAG: Merida_003_f
But then... I suppose you're different, aren't you?

TAG: Merida_000_f
You ought to be able to get inside with your <Lore>Royal Net</Lore>, the same way you did with the Mythic Trial!

TAG: Merida_006_f
Only one problem... <Lore>The wheel is missing</Lore>!

TAG: Merida_007_f
Och! It is! Looks like it's been torn clean off. It's that wolf again, I know it is!

TAG: Merida_004_f
Let's <Lore>search around for the wheel</Lore>. Let me know if you run into any trouble... or any wolves.

TAG: Merida_005_f
I'd wager you could get inside with your <Lore>Royal Net</Lore>!
