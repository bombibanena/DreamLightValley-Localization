Aye. You could say I'm crawling in brothers.

TAG: Merida_001_f
They're triplets and wee terrors.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What do you mean terrors?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What are their names?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Three is a lot.

TAG: Merida_002_f
My brothers are always causing trouble.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Tying bootlaces together. Leading folks on chases. Stealing food.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Once they chopped off a man's whiskers while he slept!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They sound like a lot of trouble.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You love them, though?

TAG: Merida_009_f
They're made of trouble. Great little monsters.

TAG: Merida_010_f
And I wouldn't change a thing about them.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Of course I love them! They're little monsters...

TAG: Merida_005_f
Hamish, Hubert, and Harris.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Three boys always adventuring for mischief in the name of sweets.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Aye, it is. One more than you can catch easily.

TAG: Merida_008_f
But they're always together, so that helps.
