Ugh! Would you look at this gloopy mess!

The Lorekeeper once told me that the Vale is held together with something called Story Magic.

It's the warm fuzzy feeling we get when we share a story we love and pass it on to someone else.

I've a feeling you've already got some Story Magic in you, {PlayerName}. But I think you'll need a whole lot of it to get rid of this wall of ink.

From what I've seen, you get more Story Magic by <Lore>fixing and repairing things</Lore> around the Vale.

TAG: Merida_005_f
Just like when you fix up an old book you love or share a favorite story.

Let's remove this wall of ink. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyStoryMagic" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll come back later when I'm ready.

TAG: Merida_006_f
You already had enough Story Magic just from cleaning up the Library of Lore!

TAG: Merida_008_f
You haven't got enough Story Magic yet, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Merida_009_f
Why don't you try removing some of the <Lore>Inkies</Lore> scattered about?

TAG: Merida_010_f
I bet if you do that, you can collect some of the magic that pops out!
