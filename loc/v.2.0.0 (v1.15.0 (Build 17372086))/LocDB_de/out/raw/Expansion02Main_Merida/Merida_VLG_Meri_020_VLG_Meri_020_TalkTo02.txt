Merida... Flynn tells me that you stuck some posters up around his House.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Do these look familiar to you?

TAG: Merida_005_f
Hmm? Oh, definitely. That's Flynn, all right.

TAG: Merida_006_f
They really captured his nose, don't you think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I've gotta admit, that's pretty funny.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's not nice, Merida.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Hee-hee. That'll show him.

TAG: Merida_017_f
What sort of person leaves a collection of his own wanted posters just lying about anyway?

TAG: Merida_000_f
I bet he takes them out and just looks at himself every day.

TAG: Merida_010_f
Well, has he learned his lesson yet?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Definitely.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think so.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
No. But he's getting there.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Good. Then, as long as he leaves me alone, I'll leave him alone.

TAG: Merida_012_f
It would be best if we could all get along. You and Flynn aren't so different.

TAG: Merida_013_f
I'll bet you would be really good friends if you just got to know one another.

TAG: Merida_015_f
We don't ALL have to be friends around here. But if you REALLY insist...

TAG: Merida_014_f
Back home, the clans would get together and talk out their disputes over a grand feast.

TAG: Merida_016_f
Great idea! I'll whip something up for you! You invite Flynn and I'll bring a meal from right here in the Bind for you.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Hmph. He ought to be happy I didn't use them for target practice.
