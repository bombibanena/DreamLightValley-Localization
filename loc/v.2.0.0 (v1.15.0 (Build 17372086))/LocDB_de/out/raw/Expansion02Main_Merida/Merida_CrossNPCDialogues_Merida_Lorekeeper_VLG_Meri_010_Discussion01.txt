Lorekeeper! How are you feeling today?

TAG: Merida_009_f
{PlayerName} really is all we'd hoped for, eh?

TAG: Merida_010_f
Yes. With Princess Aurora gone and no word from the good fairies...

TAG: Merida_011_f
...I fear {PlayerName} is our last, best hope.

TAG: Merida_002_f
Better and better, Merida; ever since {PlayerName} arrived.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Perhaps we've turned a new page in the fight against the Neverafter.

TAG: Merida_004_f
That's just why I wanted to chat.

TAG: Merida_005_f
I'm trying to help {PlayerName} catch the Snippets faster.

TAG: Merida_006_f
And I remember you said something once about magical traps for them?

TAG: Merida_007_f
Ah, yes! The good fairies left behind instructions that you might find most useful.

TAG: Merida_008_f
Before {PlayerName} arrived, I feared that no one would be able to harness their magic.
