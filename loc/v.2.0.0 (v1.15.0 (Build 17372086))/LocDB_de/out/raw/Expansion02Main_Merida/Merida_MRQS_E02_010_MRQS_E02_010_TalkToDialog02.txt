There she is! Right over there. She used some of her last magic to send that invitation to you.

Poor thing has barely got the strength left to turn a page.

I don't see anybody?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Helloooo. Lorekeeper?! You in here?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Wait a second... are you talking about that book over there?

TAG: Merida_005_f
You don't? She's right there! In front of that torn tapestry.

TAG: Merida_006_f
<Lore>Come on! I'll introduce you!</Lore>

TAG: Merida_012_f
Oh... oh no...

TAG: Merida_013_f
We're too late. Her magic... It's almost all gone...

TAG: Merida_014_f
Wait! I... I think she's got a wee bit of strength left in her! Go on... <Lore>Talk to her</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_007_f
You don't need to shout. She isn't doing well, but she's still got her hearing.

TAG: Merida_008_f
She's right over there by the torn tapestry.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Och! I forgot. I suppose if you're just meeting her for the first time, that IS a bit surprising.

When your mum's been turned into a bear, you get used to that sort of thing.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Don't worry. For a book, she's awful talkative.
