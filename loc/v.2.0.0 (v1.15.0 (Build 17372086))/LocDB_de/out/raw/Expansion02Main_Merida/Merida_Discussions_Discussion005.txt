Well, I'm fond of apples. Though I also love bannocks with honey and jam.

Apples are great.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What are bannocks?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What about haggis?

TAG: Merida_001_f
Especially in the fall when they're cold and crunchy.

You know who else likes apples?

TAG: Merida_003_f
My horse Angus. They're his favorite snack.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Ooh, they're little brown oat cakes.

TAG: Merida_005_f
Topped with honey and a wee bit of berry jam.

TAG: Merida_006_f
They're especially good when you get back from riding. I can eat them by the plate full.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Nothing wrong with a nice bit of haggis!

My brothers won't even touch it, though. But Mum says they'd like it if they tried it.
