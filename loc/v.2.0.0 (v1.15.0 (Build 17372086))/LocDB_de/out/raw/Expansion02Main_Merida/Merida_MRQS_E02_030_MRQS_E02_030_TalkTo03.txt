Did you hear that howling, {PlayerName}?!

TAG: Merida_001_f
And do you see those footprints on the path?

TAG: Merida_002_f
I'd wager it's a beast twice the size of my dad. And he's huge!

TAG: Merida_003_f
The Lorekeeper once told me a story about a wolf like this that liked to eat little redheaded girls.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I think you mean "red-hooded" girls.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Seriously, let's just try chatting with this wolf and seeing if he's nice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're not actually scared, are you?

TAG: Merida_004_f
Oh. Maybe I do. But I'm not taking any chances.

TAG: Merida_010_f
All it would take is one second of letting our guard down...

TAG: Merida_008_f
...and then CHOMP! One bite and we'll be down the beast's throat.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Och, exploring here is exciting, isn't it? Like the day I climbed the Crone's Tooth and drank from the Fire Falls.

TAG: Merida_006_f
But that's a story for another time. Let's keep moving, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merida_012_f
I'll keep an arrow nocked, just in case...

TAG: Merida_005_f
Nice?! Are you daft? We can't just sit down and have a chat.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Scared? No. But I'd be foolish not to be a wee bit worried when there's a beast like that about.

TAG: Merida_009_f
One second we're wandering these woods, letting our guards down...
