Ah, jings, crivvens, help ma boab!

TAG: Merida_015_f
I've had enough of these wee flying Snippets! I swear they think my hair is fair game for building their nests.

TAG: Merida_002_f
{PlayerName}, could I help you put that Royal Net of yours to work catching more of them?

TAG: Merida_003_f
I've got loads of Clan DunBroch wisdom about tracking creatures that I learned from my dad. What do you say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure! Let's hunt some Snippets!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm a bit busy right now.

TAG: Merida_004_f
That's grand! We'll make a whole day of it.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Now, the first rule my dad taught me, when I was only as tall as his knee and he was teaching me to use my bow out on the moors, is...

TAG: Merida_007_f
You start by <Lore>controlling the terrain</Lore>. You'll never have any luck catching Snippets if you're stumbling over all this rubble.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
This place IS still a bit of a mess.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
But how do I get rid of all the rubble?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm clumsy enough even with NOTHING in my way.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Can you imagine living here all that time with this mess and clarty ink everywhere?

TAG: Merida_011_f
We're lucky you showed up when you did.

TAG: Merida_008_f
I say we start with the <Lore>Mossy Logs</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_012_f
<Lore>Follow me</Lore> and I'll show you.

TAG: Merida_010_f
I think I've got a way. But we'll have to find some of it just to be sure.

TAG: Merida_013_f
Don't be so harsh on yourself. You're already quite good at swinging that Royal Net around.

TAG: Merida_016_f
The problem is there's so much in your way while you're trying to do it.

TAG: Merida_005_f
Well, all right. I'll just keep swatting at them till they buzz off!
