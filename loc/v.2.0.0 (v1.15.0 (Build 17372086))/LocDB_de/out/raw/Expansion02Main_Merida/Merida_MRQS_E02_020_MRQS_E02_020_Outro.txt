{PlayerName}, the Bind feels like it's got a bit of its old magic back!

TAG: Merida_002_f
Everything the Lorekeeper said about you... I wasn't sure if I should believe it, if I should let myself hope...

TAG: Merida_003_f
...but it's true! Some people are even better than the heroes you find in stories.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I couldn't have done it without you, Merida. You're a hero too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Aw shucks. Thank you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But all I did was chase some origami birds around and clean up some spilled ink...

TAG: Merida_004_f
{PlayerName} and Merida... creators of our own destinies! I like it.

TAG: Merida_007_f
But we can't rest yet. Our journey's only just begun.

TAG: Merida_008_f
Next, you'll have to <Lore>get rid of those big walls of ink that are</Lore> stopping us from getting into <Lore>Everafter and Mythopia</Lore>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Tell me more about Everafter.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Tell me more about Mythopia.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
How do I get rid of all the ink? Where should I start?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Say no more. I'm ready to do this.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Well, you'll find Everafter on the west side of the Vale.

TAG: Merida_010_f
It's a land made up of fairy tales and fables... or so the Lorekeeper tells me. They're not any fables I know, but they're definitely interesting.

TAG: Merida_011_f
They've got mushrooms there as big as a house! Oh, but be careful. I've heard howling from over there that's chilled my blood.

TAG: Merida_013_f
You've got to watch out for the <Lore>dragons</Lore> too. They're just wee ones. But their teeth are awful sharp.

TAG: Merida_014_f
And the Snippets over there are different. They're frogs, hopping all about.

TAG: Merida_015_f
As soon as you can <Lore>figure out how to reach Maleficent in her castle</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_046_f
But watch out for her. She calls herself something daft like "Mistress of All Evil."

TAG: Merida_048_f
Oh, and she can turn into a fire-breathing dragon. A BIG one. You'd best watch out for that nasty trick.

TAG: Merida_028_f
Okay, I'm ready to do this.

TAG: Merida_026_f
There's nothing as exciting as setting out on an adventure, is there?

TAG: Merida_027_f
To start, <Lore>gather enough Story Magic</Lore> to clear away one of those walls of ink. And remember: I'll always be here if you need a spot of help.

TAG: Merida_016_f
You'll find Mythopia on the east side of the Vale.

TAG: Merida_017_f
The Lorekeeper told me it's a land made up of myths and legends. Though, truth be told, they're not any myths or legends I'm familiar with.

TAG: Merida_018_f
They've got huge marble columns there, and golden fields. It's quite a sight!

TAG: Merida_019_f
Oh, and there are some flying creatures too. Wee horses with wings. *gasp* Maybe you could tame one?!

TAG: Merida_020_f
Now, the Snippets over there are the worst of all. They're wee pixie things that fly around and disappear whenever you get near!

TAG: Merida_021_f
Of course, you'll have to find some way to scale that huge mountain to reach Mount Olympus if you're ever going to <Lore>find Hades</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_049_f
As for Hades... Well, I used to think my hair was fiery until I met him.

TAG: Merida_050_f
But he's a blowhard. Flatter him and I don't think he'll give you much trouble.

TAG: Merida_022_f
You haven't forgotten already, have you? The same way you got rid of the ink that was blocking the way into the Bind.

TAG: Merida_023_f
Just gather up enough Story Magic by explorin' the Bind, clearing away Inkies, and catching Snippets.

TAG: Merida_024_f
Then focus all that magic at the wall of ink.

TAG: Merida_025_f
If it were me, I'd <Lore>start with Everafter</Lore>. Convincing Maleficent will take some time.

TAG: Merida_051_f
And you might even find some other Villagers stranded there who can help you along the way.

TAG: Merida_005_f
No, thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Aye, but nobody else could do it! Every one of those paper pests you catch is one that's not buzzing about my ear!
