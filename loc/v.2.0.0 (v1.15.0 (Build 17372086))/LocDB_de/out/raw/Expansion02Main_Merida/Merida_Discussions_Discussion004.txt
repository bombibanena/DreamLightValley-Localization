I've been thinking about stories. How the right tales bring people together, help us solve our differences and problems, show us how we're the same, deep down.

You're good at that, aren't you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I've tried my best.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The people were good enough to listen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Stories are important.

TAG: Merida_002_f
From what I hear, your best has been incredible!

TAG: Merida_006_f
Do you think we'll be able to tell a story for Hades and Maleficent?

TAG: Merida_007_f
Something that will stop their feuding?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I do. They'll see reason.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm not sure. They're very angry.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I hope so.

TAG: Merida_008_f
I hope you're right. We have to see our way through this.

TAG: Merida_009_f
There's peace on the other side.

TAG: Merida_010_f
True. But I've seen angrier folks see reason.

TAG: Merida_011_f
My mum was good at that. Making people calm down and be reasonable.

TAG: Merida_012_f
I hope so too. For the sake of the Vale.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Aye. You've got to be ready to hear a story for it to do you any good.

TAG: Merida_004_f
They are. They're how we keep truth and tell it to each other.

TAG: Merida_005_f
They're how we remember important things.
