That Royal Net can't be far. Where did the Lorekeeper say it was? Beneath something...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm stumped. Help me!

Don't worry. I'll find it!

Well, first we've got to find that <Lore>potion</Lore> and use it on your Pickaxe. It's in my bag over in the corner.

Then I'm sure you can use your Pickaxe to get rid of all those big hunks of <ActivityItem>Petrified Wood</ActivityItem>.

Which should uncover that <Lore>strange disc</Lore> in the middle of the floor. Maybe then we can spin it around to make a picture and it would unlock something.

Let me know if you need any help. I'll take a look around myself.
