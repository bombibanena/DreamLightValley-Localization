A million! But I'll start with... Would you rather live like royalty in a castle or wild in a forest?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Royal castle, for SURE!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm the forest-y type.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I want both! Don't put me in a box.

TAG: Merida_001_f
Castles do have their comforts... Roaring fires, grand views...

They can be a bit drafty in winter, but that's not a problem a few tapestries and blankets can't fix.

TAG: Merida_003_f
I love the woods, too! They're so full of life and adventure.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Of course, it's nice to have a roof over your head.

TAG: Merida_008_f
Especially during a storm.

TAG: Merida_005_f
Aye, that's fair. I think I'd go for both as well.

TAG: Merida_007_f
There's nothing better than spending a day in the forest, and then coming home to someplace warm.

TAG: Merida_009_f
... And a big plate of cakes, right?
