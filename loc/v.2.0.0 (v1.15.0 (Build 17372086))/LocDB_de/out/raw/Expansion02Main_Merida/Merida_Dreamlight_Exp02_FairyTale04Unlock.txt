This is the way to <Lore>the Beanstalk Marshes</Lore>. The shadow of Maleficent's castle covers this place.

But I know we're brave enough to step forth and explore! If you want to clear this ink in the way, that is.

Let's clear the way to the Beanstalk Marshes. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyStoryMagic" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, not just yet.

TAG: Merida_002_f
Look! The ink is melting away! Now we can explore the Marshes. Though, we'd better keep our wits about us. Things in there can be tricky.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Ugh! You need more <Lore>Story Magic</Lore> to tackle this cursed ink wall!

TAG: Merida_004_f
You're the only one who can reach these unreachable places.

TAG: Merida_005_f
Promise me we'll come back here soon.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Aw, really?

TAG: Merida_007_f
We'd better learn a little more about Everafter before we go near Maleficent's stronghold.

TAG: Merida_008_f
Let's head back towards the Bind and clear away the ink blocking the way from THAT direction first.
