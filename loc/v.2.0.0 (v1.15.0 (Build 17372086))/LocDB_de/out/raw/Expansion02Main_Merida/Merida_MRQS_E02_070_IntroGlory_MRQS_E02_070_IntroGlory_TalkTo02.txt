I hear you've been exploring Mythopia, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Who knows; perhaps you'll earn your own place in the legends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Hmmm... "{PlayerName}, hero of legend" does have a nice ring.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I hope it isn't the kind of legend where I'm turned to stone or chained to a rock...

TAG: Merida_014_f
Aye, I can even hear the ballad they'll sing for you!

TAG: Merida_019_f
Well, is there anything *I* can do to help you earn your place in the legends?

TAG: Merida_006_f
Actually, you can. I stumbled upon something.

TAG: Merida_007_f
It was a gateway to another trial, just like the ones in Everafter.

TAG: Merida_008_f
But it seems that this one is caused by Hades... not Maleficent.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Och! I found that same one back before all that ink flooded the land!

TAG: Merida_010_f
The one near those huge statues of the funny horses with wings, right?

TAG: Merida_011_f
Let's <Lore>go see it</Lore>!

TAG: Merida_012_f
It looked like a kind of gateway, filled with ink. The Lorekeeper told me that it's a Mythic Trial.

TAG: Merida_015_f
Hmm... I don't know much about the legends and myths that make up Mythopia. Only what the Lorekeeper tells me.

TAG: Merida_016_f
But the ones I DO know have some dark twists and turns.

TAG: Merida_017_f
Remind me to tell you about the beasts they say live in the depths of our lochs!

TAG: Merida_018_f
Kelpies, selkies, monsters â not the sorts of things you want to run into on an evening stroll.

TAG: Merida_021_f
I haven't run into anything like that! But I did find something interesting.
