He bragged about that scaffy shot, didn't he?

TAG: Merida_004_f
Well, I almost feel sorry for him. Time to put him out of his misery.

TAG: Merida_005_f
MISERY?! HA! More like victory.

TAG: Merida_006_f
"Time to put him out of his victory"...? That makes about as much sense as anything else that numpty says.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Flynn sounds awfully confident.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're sure you've got this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Destroy him, Merida.

TAG: Merida_007_f
All the better to prove him wrong.

TAG: Merida_016_f
WHAT?! I missed the bullseye by a mile!

TAG: Merida_017_f
Guess you're not as good a shot as you thought.

TAG: Merida_018_f
There's no way. Everything was lined up perfectly. I could make that shot in my sleep.

TAG: Merida_019_f
Could it be my bow? Or maybe the arrows?

TAG: Merida_020_f
Something isn't right here. I'll <Lore>go investigate</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_010_f
You ready? On the count of three...

TAG: Merida_011_f
Three...

TAG: Merida_012_f
Two...

TAG: Merida_013_f
One!

TAG: Merida_014_f
Fire!

TAG: Merida_000_f
Here goes...

TAG: Merida_015_f
... Huh?!

TAG: Merida_008_f
I've made far more difficult shots than this. Trust me.

TAG: Merida_009_f
When I'm finished, he'll be too embarrassed to ever loose an arrow in the Vale again.
