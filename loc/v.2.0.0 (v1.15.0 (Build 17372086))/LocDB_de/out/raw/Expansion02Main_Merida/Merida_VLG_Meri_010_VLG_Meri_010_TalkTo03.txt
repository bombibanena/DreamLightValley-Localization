You've caught so many Snippets, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Merida_002_f
This is the perfect time to tell you the next rule of tracking my dad taught me...

TAG: Merida_003_f
Never let anything go to waste!

TAG: Merida_004_f
Use whatever you catch and use all of it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I should put these Snippets back in their rightful place.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you telling me to EAT the Snippets?

TAG: Merida_005_f
Exactly!

TAG: Merida_009_f
Oh, but you've already fixed so many of the Lorekeeper's stories...

TAG: Merida_010_f
Maybe you can find something ELSE to do with those Snippets then.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Just let me know when you're ready to keep on with our day.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Return those Snippets to the Lorekeeper's pages!

TAG: Merida_008_f
There are still <Lore>countless tales</Lore> left to put back together.

TAG: Merida_006_f
Ugh! No! They'd be dry as a week-old bannock!
