Talked to the Lorekeeper, did you? She's the friendliest book you've ever met, I'll venture.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She said I'll need to fix the feud.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She said I need to clean up this place.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She doesn't seem to be doing too well.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Aye, and to do that, you'll have to find Maleficent and Hades and convince them to talk to each other.

TAG: Merida_006_f
It won't be easy. Those two are feuding worse than the fiercest rival clans from back home.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Makes our squabbles in DunBroch seem like pillow fights.

TAG: Merida_008_f
I expect you'll find Maleficent and Hades <Lore>in their castles</Lore>. I bet you saw them through the windows behind the Lorekeeper.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Maleficent has that dark, <Lore>scary castle to the far northwest</Lore>...

TAG: Merida_010_f
...and Hades settled himself in that <Lore>kingdom in the clouds to the far northeast</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_027_f
Problem is, all that clarty ink's blocking the way.

TAG: Merida_028_f
When you're done exploring in here, <Lore>meet me outside the Library of Lore</Lore>, and I'll show you what I mean.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Aye, you'll have to if you're to find Maleficent and Hades.

TAG: Merida_005_f
And that's exactly why we've got to fix things around here. And the fixing starts with finding Maleficent and Hades.
