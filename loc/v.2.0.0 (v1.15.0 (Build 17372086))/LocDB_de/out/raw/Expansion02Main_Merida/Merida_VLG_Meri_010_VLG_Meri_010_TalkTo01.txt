Would you look at that? The Bind's practically brand new!

TAG: Merida_002_f
While I was gone, I thought about another of my dad's lessons for tracking...

TAG: Merida_003_f
Use everything at your disposal to gain the advantage.

I bet you wish you could slow down those Snippets a bit, don't you?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Naw. They're easy to catch!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I like the challenge.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
They're SO FAST AND ANNOYING, AGGGHHH!

TAG: Merida_008_f
Well, just in case you want to make it even easier...

TAG: Merida_004_f
Here. The Lorekeeper gave me these instructions left behind by the good fairies.

TAG: Merida_005_f
I can't make heads nor tails of them...

TAG: Merida_006_f
...but the Lorekeeper told me it'll show you how to make something called a <Lore>Slow Trap</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_012_f
She said you can build it with <Lore>some of the magical things you find around the Bind</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_013_f
And it'll <Lore>slow all the nearby Snippets down</Lore>!

TAG: Merida_014_f
That ought to make those flappy little devils easier to catch.

TAG: Merida_000_f
Oh, and here! I gathered up some extra <ActivityItem>Moss</ActivityItem> for you to get you started.

TAG: Merida_009_f
Oh, I know you can catch them, but just in case you ever want to make things a bit easier, I've got something to help.

TAG: Merida_010_f
Och, I know! They're always buzzing about my head, so I can hardly even think.

TAG: Merida_011_f
But I've got something to help you with that.
