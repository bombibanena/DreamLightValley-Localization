I can't believe it! You got rid of those <ActivityItem>Inkies</ActivityItem> just by looking at them funny and waving your hands!

TAG: Merida_002_f
How'd you do that? I tried everything and the dodgy things wouldn't budge.

TAG: Merida_003_f
The Lorekeeper told me only one person might be able to remove them. Hold on... You're not... You couldn't be...

TAG: Merida_004_f
You're {PlayerName}, aren't you?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You seemed to be stuck in that... ink?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Depends who's asking...

TAG: Merida_005_f
Och, am I glad to see you!

TAG: Merida_008_f
I'm Merida, firstborn descendant of Clan DunBroch. The Lorekeeper told me she invited you!

TAG: Merida_009_f
Welcome to the Storybook Vale. It's in a heap of trouble, in case you hadn't noticed...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Those "Inkies," you called 'em... What are they?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who's the Lorekeeper?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What IS this place?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
No time for more talk. How can I help?

TAG: Merida_010_f
The Lorekeeper says they're the magic of the land, leavin' it slowly.

TAG: Merida_014_f
And they've been leaking out all over the Vale!

TAG: Merida_015_f
You should be able to use that magic of yours to get rid of the wee ones for now, at least.

TAG: Merida_023_f
How can I help with all of this?

TAG: Merida_013_f
I only wish you'd gotten here a wee bit sooner. It might be too late for the Lorekeeper now.

TAG: Merida_019_f
She's... Well, there's no point in making it sound good. Her magic's been leaving her slowly, and now... well...

TAG: Merida_020_f
...I don't think she's got long left, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merida_021_f
Ugh, I'm no good at describing things. <Lore>Follow me</Lore> into the <Lore>Library of Lore</Lore> and see for yourself.

TAG: Merida_011_f
Och, she's just the wisest one in all the Vale. Sort of like a kindly old granny who watches over the place.

TAG: Merida_016_f
I'll introduce you to her soon... if only she can hang on long enough.

TAG: Merida_012_f
Well, the Lorekeeper says this whole place was made of stories.

TAG: Merida_017_f
It used to be a beautiful land, where all our destinies were woven together like a cloth.

TAG: Merida_018_f
Only now it's all coming apart at the seams...

TAG: Merida_006_f
I know, I know. Clarty Inkies. By the way, thank you for helping me.

TAG: Merida_007_f
Aye, s'pose I ought to introduce myself...
