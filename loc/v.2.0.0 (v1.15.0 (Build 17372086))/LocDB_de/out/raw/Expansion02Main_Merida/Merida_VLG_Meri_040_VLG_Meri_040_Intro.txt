Just who I was hoping to see! {PlayerName}, do you have time to talk about a Scottish celebration I'm planning?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I love a good celebration!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hold that thought, and I'll get back to you!

TAG: Merida_002_f
That's grand! You see, finding that old family artifact got me thinking... I want to host a proper Highland Festival!

TAG: Merida_004_f
We've all been working so hard, I think everyone would really enjoy it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I love this idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What did you have in mind?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
As long as I don't have to eat haggis.

TAG: Merida_006_f
I was hoping you'd say that!

TAG: Merida_009_f
We can decorate with banners from my family, Clan DunBroch...

TAG: Merida_010_f
...and have a HUGE banquet! Though a proper Scottish feast would require a giant table...

TAG: Player_004_f
I'll talk to Mr. McDuck!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
He'll be happy to supply us!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
He'll LOVE that we're bringing a touch of Scotland here.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
As long as your clans aren't rivals?

TAG: Merida_016_f
Aye? That'll be grand!

TAG: Merida_017_f
Okay, Merida, I'll <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck about ordering some banquet supplies and some Clan DunBroch Banners</Lore>.

TAG: Merida_018_f
Good. And while you do that, I'll talk to Tiana. I want Scottish food for the party but honestly... I've never had much skill in the kitchen.

TAG: Merida_019_f
I've a great lineage of burned bannocks to prove it.

TAG: Merida_014_f
I think he will too!

TAG: Merida_015_f
Not at all! I've nothing but respect for Clan McDuck.

TAG: Merida_007_f
You won't. But really, you should give it a try. It's quite tasty, actually.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Maybe someday I will!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
REALLY think it's not my thing.

TAG: Merida_012_f
That's it! Embrace your adventurous spirit!

TAG: Merida_013_f
But back to our festival...

TAG: Merida_011_f
That's fine. To each their own.

TAG: Merida_003_f
Aye. You know where to find me when you're ready.
