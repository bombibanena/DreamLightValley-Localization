So you see this place, {PlayerName}? It's called <Lore>the Bind</Lore>!

TAG: Merida_002_f
I think the name's because it sort of binds the whole Vale together.

TAG: Merida_004_f
And it's got stories sewn right into it. From the walls of the cliffs to the leaves of the trees to the paths beneath your feet.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's beautiful!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's cozy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
So... many... books...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
It's kind of a mess right now, isn't it?

TAG: Merida_003_f
Aye, it reminds me of my home at harvest time.

TAG: Merida_007_f
If you think it's a beauty now, you ought to have seen it before.

TAG: Merida_006_f
The poor place has seen far better days. When the Neverafter struck, it all went to pieces.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Don't worry. I'm getting pretty good at fixing broken things.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
So if we stop Maleficent and Hades' feud... maybe it will fix itself?

TAG: Merida_008_f
The Lorekeeper told me that about you, {PlayerName}. And I'm beginnin' to believe you might even be able to fix all this!

TAG: Merida_024_f
The Bind needs a heap of work before it'll be back to its former glory.

TAG: Merida_027_f
Why don't you try <Lore>clearing up some of these Inkies and catching some of those Snippets</Lore> flyin' about?

TAG: Merida_026_f
And I'll work on the <Lore>fountains</Lore>. They're all dried up and broken. But don't worry. I'll get them bubbling again.

TAG: Merida_009_f
No, you've got it all backwards. If we're going to get to those two hot heads in the first place, we need to clean this place up first.

TAG: Merida_005_f
That's for sure. Though, most of these don't talk like the Lorekeeper.
