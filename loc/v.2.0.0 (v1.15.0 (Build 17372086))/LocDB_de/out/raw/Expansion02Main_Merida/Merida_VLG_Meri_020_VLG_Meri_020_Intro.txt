AHH!!! That good-for-nothing bragging dunderheid!

TAG: Merida_003_f
I've had just about enough of him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Whoa. Who are you talking about?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uhhhh... good luck dealing with all that.

TAG: Merida_004_f
Who do you think?

TAG: Merida_005_f
There might be a couple of good-for-nothing bragging dunderheids around here... but today <Lore>Flynn Rider</Lore> is the worst of them!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Flynn's got a good heart underneath it all.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I can see how you and Flynn would be like fire and water.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
*sigh* What did Flynn do?

TAG: Merida_008_f
I know. But he's buried it pretty deep.

TAG: Merida_010_f
I was minding my own, practicing in the woods with my bow, when Flynn came along and just had to give me a few "pointers."

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Maybe he was just trying to be helpful?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I've seen you use that bow. You don't need any advice.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I didn't know Flynn was an archer.

TAG: Merida_012_f
If I needed his help, I'd have asked for it.

TAG: Merida_018_f
When I told him, "Thank you, but I don't need your advice," he even had the nerve to say I was holding my bow wrong! I'm the best archer in DunBroch. I know how to hold my bow!

TAG: Merida_011_f
He reminds me of one of the lads who tried to shoot for my hand in marriage. All bluster and no skill.

TAG: Merida_015_f
I don't suppose you could <Lore>talk to Flynn</Lore> and get through that thick head of his that when it comes to archery, I don't need his "pointers"!

TAG: Merida_013_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. It would be nice if Flynn understood that.

TAG: Merida_014_f
{PlayerName}, you've missed the whole point!

TAG: Merida_009_f
Well, he definitely has me steamed!

TAG: Merida_006_f
I'll try my best, {PlayerName}, but I'm afraid I might need your help if I can't sort it myself.

TAG: Merida_007_f
I can't take much more of him.
