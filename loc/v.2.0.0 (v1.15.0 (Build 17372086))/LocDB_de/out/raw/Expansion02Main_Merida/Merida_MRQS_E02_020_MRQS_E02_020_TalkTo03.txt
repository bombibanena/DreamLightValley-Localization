The fountains! I can't believe it! They're back on!

TAG: Merida_002_f
Now the Bind looks almost as beautiful as it did back before Maleficent and Hades made such a blooming mess of the place.

I guess the secret was hidden inside that room all along. It was a strange place, though, wasn't it? If only the princess herself had been in there.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
We have to find the princess.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The princess seemed to be working on something... something special.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I haven't got time to figure out where some princess has run off to on top of everything else.

TAG: Merida_011_f
I haven't seen her in ages. I don't think she's in the Bind anymore.

TAG: Merida_014_f
Oh, I hope Hades or Maleficent haven't gotten hold of her...

TAG: Merida_003_f
*sigh* But we can't do anything about that at the moment. For now, the Bind is almost feeling like home again. If only it weren't missing <i>my</i> home...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh. Where do you live around here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What happened to your house?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I could build you a new place?

TAG: Merida_004_f
Well, since that clarty ink carried away my cottage...

TAG: Merida_005_f
...I've been staying up at the Library with the Lorekeeper.

TAG: Merida_006_f
But it's such a mess that it's barely a roof over my head.

TAG: Merida_009_f
I'll <Lore>lay down some foundations</Lore> here in the Bind. After that, Mr. McDuck will take care of the rest!

TAG: Merida_007_f
It was swept away by that clarty ink!

TAG: Merida_008_f
Would you?! My house was swept away by all that clarty ink.

TAG: Merida_012_f
We'll have to find her to sort out what. But I haven't seen her in ages. I don't think she's in the Bind anymore.

TAG: Merida_013_f
Finding Princess Aurora is the key to all of this! But I haven't seen her in ages. I don't think she's in the Bind anymore.
