Well, look who's here for a visit after freeing me from this horrid cave.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Alas, nothing in the Valley compares to my home in Triton's palace...

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Or my little soul garden. Such comfort is only a dream now... unless... YOU help?

TAG: Player_001_f
I can give you...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A home, no questions asked.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
A home... for a price.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Something, some other time.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
You could? Fabulous, dearie. I'd like a beachfront house.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Something elaborate, but also fitting my dark aesthetic. Visitors should be a little nervous.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
It keeps them on their toes... or fins.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Hmm... Seems you aren't the pushover I thought.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
Fine. You want to swim with the big fish? Let's make a deal!

TAG: Ursula_019_f
Get me a house on the Beach and help me with an errand, and I'll give you EXACTLY what you deserve.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
You're saying NO to me?! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Ha-ha-ha... I mean... that's absolutely fine. Come by another time, angelfish. And make it SOON!
