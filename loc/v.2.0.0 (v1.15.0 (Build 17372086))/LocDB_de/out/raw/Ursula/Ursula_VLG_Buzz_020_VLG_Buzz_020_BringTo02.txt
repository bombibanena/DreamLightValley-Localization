What's this?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Ugh! You're bothering me about that annoying little creature? Again?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Angelfish, wouldn't it be better if I turned him into something that can't move... or talk? A sea anemone perhaps?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Please calm down.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Why are you so angry?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm on your side.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Calm down? I'm the victim in this situation!

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Tell me, dearie, what would you do if someone was constantly harassing you simply because of who you are?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'd prove to them I can be nice.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'd try to understand them.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I'd pretend I changed my ways.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Those who see themselves in authority rarely change their minds. Just look at Triton. Oh, but I've been playing this game long enough to know what to do.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
I'll PRETEND I respect the irritating little plaything.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Understandâ?! The only thing that piece of junk understands is when people flatter his ego.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
But I am impressed he's gone to such lengths to try and intimidate me. It's almost... charming.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Well, if it'll get him to stop annoying me, I'll pretend I respect the irritating little plaything.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Hmm... You have a point, child. Maybe what that irritating little plaything is waiting for is for me to acknowledge his authority.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Some are so easily manipulated by appearances.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
Fine. I'll pretend to be afraid of him if it buys me some peace. I'll avoid the little ranger.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Ask yourself, dear... how would you react if someone was constantly harassing you simply because of who you are?

TAG: Ursula_014_f
But you still let that creature pester me incessantly. Tell me, dearie, how would you react in my place?

TAG: Ursula_001_f
If someone was constantly harassing you simply because of who you are?
