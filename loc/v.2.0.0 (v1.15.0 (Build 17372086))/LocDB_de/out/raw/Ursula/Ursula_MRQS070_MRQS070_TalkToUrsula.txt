You're telling me you got trapped in this cave trying to help the Village?

TAG: Ursula_016_f
And here I thought I knew everyone in the Village. Who are you, angelfish?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Are you the one who trapped me here? Leaving me to waste away, wretched and alone?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm the hero of the Valley!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
First things first... Who are YOU?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Merlin sent me.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
A hero, you say...

TAG: Ursula_027_f
Why, that's just what I need! You see, I'm stuck in this rotten cave. Won't you help a poor girl out?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
You must possess great magic if you got through the cave entrance...

TAG: Ursula_022_f
And if you can get in, that means you can also get out.

TAG: Ursula_020_f
What do you say, dearie? Will you help your new friend Ursula out of this cave... hmmm?

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
How do I get you out?

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
What's in it for me?

TAG: Player_007_choice_002_f
How did you get trapped here?

TAG: Ursula_001_f
By breaking the spell on the cave, you fool!

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Er, I mean, angelfish...

TAG: Ursula_012_f
You see, before the Forgetting happened, the <Lore>Pillar of Power</Lore> protected Dazzle Beach from curses and evil magic.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
But soon after the Forgetting began, a starfish told me someone had stolen the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> from the Pillar and hid it in a cave on the Beach.

TAG: Ursula_026_f
Of course, I was just dying to help the Village, so I started to search this cave to try and find it.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
And what was the reward for my good deed?

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Imprisonment in this horrid cave!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Oh no! Poor you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
You're lying. I can tell.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Should've looked out for yourself first.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Finally, someone who cares about me!

TAG: Ursula_023_f
Thanks, angelfish. You're a doll. Now where were we? Oh...

TAG: Ursula_002_f
The <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> isn't here. It must be hidden in another cave on the Beach.

TAG: Ursula_047_f
If you get me out, I'll tell you everything you need to know about the Forgetting. Do we have a deal, dearie?

TAG: Player_009_choice_000_f
Deal!

TAG: Player_009_choice_001_f
No way! You're a witch.

TAG: Ursula_036_f
I needed something called a <ActivityItem>Crystal Key</ActivityItem> to enter the cave where the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> is held.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
I have it here, and I'll even part with it for free. As long as you promise not to forget me while you're off running around.

TAG: Ursula_045_f
Use it correctly, and it will ignite the ancient magic hidden beneath Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Well, what are you waiting for? Hurry! We can't risk another curse hitting us and trapping you in here too...

TAG: Ursula_029_f
Not that being stuck with me would be so bad, now would it, pet?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Not at all!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You could teach me magic.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Sounds like my nightmare.

TAG: Ursula_034_f
Ha-ha-ha! You're quickly becoming my favorite human. Now just bring me that <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> and your place in my heart will be sealed.

TAG: Ursula_035_f
Ah, looking to become my apprentice, are you? There's a thought. Come back with that <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> and we'll talk, sweetie.

TAG: Ursula_030_f
You miserable wretch! Get out of here and only come back when you've got that <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Ursula_042_f
Ha! You'll soon learn that sometimes you have to trust even a witch to get what you want. And since you want me out of here, our interests are... entwined.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Think you're rather clever, don't you?

TAG: Ursula_021_f
Well, perhaps I had my own reasons for seeking the <ActivityItem>Orb of Power</ActivityItem>... I'll never tell. Anyway...

TAG: Ursula_018_f
Oh, don't you worry. I've learned my lesson.

TAG: Ursula_028_f
I always look out for myself. Anyway...

TAG: Ursula_024_f
A creature after my own heart! All right, dearie... If you get me out of here...

TAG: Ursula_010_f
...I'll tell you all I know about the Forgetting.

TAG: Ursula_031_f
That IS why you came to find me, isn't it? After all, I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
By no fault of my own, I assure you.

TAG: Ursula_032_f
I'm Ursula, the Sea Witch, of course.

TAG: Ursula_000_f
Have I been trapped in this cave so long that no one remembers who I am?! Well, we'll soon remedy that.

TAG: Ursula_033_f
As for you...

TAG: Ursula_025_f
Merlin? That old bat? He sent you to find me? Hmm... That could only mean one thing...

TAG: Ursula_006_f
His magic isn't powerful enough to get through the spell that locked me in here. But you, on the other hand...
