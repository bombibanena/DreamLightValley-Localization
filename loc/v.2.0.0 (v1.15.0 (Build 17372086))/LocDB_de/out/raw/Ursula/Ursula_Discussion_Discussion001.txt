Oh, {PlayerName}, it's you. I was just musing over the distant past. Did you know that I used to live in Atlantica? In the palace, in fact.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why did you leave?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you like it there?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why do you look different?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
It wasn't by choice, you can be sure of that. King Triton, the tyrant, exiled me.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
I was banished to waste away in the darkest part of the ocean.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's terrible!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why?

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Isn't it? All the world turned against poor innocent me. And what did I do?

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Practically nothing! I only gave the merfolk what they asked for. Is it my fault they didn't like the price?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Oh, it was over practically nothing! I only gave the merfolk what they asked for. Is it my fault they didn't like the price?

TAG: Ursula_011_f
It was all an excuse. I know Triton was really frightened by my power.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Of course! It's a palace! Oh, I miss the comforts. The feasts, the festivals. Servants at my beck and call.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
What would you miss if you were driven off and forced to live in the... well, I suppose for you it would be the woods?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Ice Cream.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Television.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Video games.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Oh, I've heard of that. A cold, sugary treat, am I right?

TAG: Ursula_017_f
I wonder if anyone here makes it in kelp flavor?

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Hm. I have no idea what that is. Some sort of ludicrous human invention, I suppose.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
I have no idea what that is. But I do enjoy games. Especially when I get to make the rules.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
You mean why am I not a waifish merperson with a dinky little green tail?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
I look different because I AM different, dear.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Not just different. Better!
