Ugh. Why are you bringing that rude, bratty creature to my home?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He was curious about you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I just wanted to introduce you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He wanted to meet a sea monster.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Angelfish, curiosity is hardly a reason to barge into my abode with that beast in tow.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I've hardly been able to get a moment's peace with him running amok in the Village.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Why, just the other day, he pestered me about my "badness level." Can you imagine?

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Get him out of here before something... unfortunate... happens.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Oh, angelfish, I've already met that little beast.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
A SEA MONSTER?!

TAG: Ursula_005_f
The only monster around here is that little beast.
