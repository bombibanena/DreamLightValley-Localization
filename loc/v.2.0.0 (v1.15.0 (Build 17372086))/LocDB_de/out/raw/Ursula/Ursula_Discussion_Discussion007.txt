Tell me, {PlayerName}, what do you think of my earrings?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're pretty.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They don't suit you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't know much about jewelry.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Aren't they? It took me ages to find two shells that matched so perfectly.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
After all, no ensemble is complete without the proper accessories.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I agree.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You would know.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm sure you could make your look work without them.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Oh, I do love it when you agree with me.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Of course I would. In my day, I was quite the fashion icon at the palace, you know.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Of course, dear. I have enough natural beauty to make anything WORK.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
The question is whether or not the look is COMPLETE.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Bah! What do you know about jewelry? I'm fond of them. That's all that matters.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
What's there to know? Wear what suits you and makes you happy.
