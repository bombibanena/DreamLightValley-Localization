Welcome back, angelfish. And I see you held up your end of the bargain. Well, a deal's a deal...

TAG: Ursula_002_f
I'll let you in on a little secret about the Forgetting...

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Everyone talks about the Forgetting as if it were just some miserable thing that happened, like an algae bloom in the ocean.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
But the Forgetting is much more than a fleeting moment in our Village's history.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
The Forgetting is caused by a Being! <Lore>The Forgotten</Lore> is as real as you and me.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
And the Forgotten is still here, cursing the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why would anyone do this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Must be very powerful!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How do I stop the Forgotten?

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Who knows? For some â not me, of course â causing trouble is its own reward!

TAG: Ursula_007_f
If we're going to stop the Forgotten, you've got to <Lore>fix the Pillars</Lore>. They're the only things that will protect the Village from the Forgotten's curses.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Now, run along, and tell whoever you must... but be careful. You never know who might be listening. Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Oh, it is. And don't you wish we could get a little of that power for ourselves? But we can discuss that later.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Now there's a good question.
