Ta-da! I used the enchantment on the Flower you brought, and it's all ready to be used!

TAG: Ursula_002_f
However, I still need your help for one last teensy little detail... Take this.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Place that flower near the entrance to that Mystical Cave on the Beach â the cave you opened with the <ActivityItem>Crystal</ActivityItem> I gave you.

What is it going to do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you sure it's really safe?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
This flower now has the power to steaâ PROTECT the power of that cave.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
