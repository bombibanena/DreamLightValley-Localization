Oh boy! What did I do to deserve this delicious-lookin' meal?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
I whipped it up with a little help from Remy. We wanted to thank everyone who took care of the Village during the Forgetting.

TAG: Player_000_f
It's our way of showing gratitude to you for...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...taking care of Remy's recipes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...doing all the gardening around here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...just being you.

Gosh, I was glad to do it. I'm just sorry for forgetting where I buried so many of 'em.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. With you and Remy around, I just know this Village is gonna keep getting better and better!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Aw, welp, I do my best. But it's nice to have somebody here who's got the magic touch again!

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Aw, that sure is nice of ya to say. I, uh... I guess I don't know how I'd be anybody else. Ha-ha!
