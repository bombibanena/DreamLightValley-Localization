Aye. This time of year, I'm longin' to see a good caber toss. Bet I could show the Villagers here a thing or two!

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Do you have a favorite Scottish sport?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Probably. I like all sports!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
There aren't any Scottish sports!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't really like sports.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Skittle me kilts! That's grand! Gettin' your heart pumpin' is good for the constitution.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
You'd probably take to the hammer toss like a McDuck takes to stock dividends!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
If you like sports, here's a wee bit of trivia for ya...

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
This sport originated in Scotland in the middle ages and has even been played on the moon!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
When it started, you'd have to hit a wee pebble with a bent stick over and around some sand dunes. What sport is it?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Baseball?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Golf?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Curling?

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Och no! You've got to read up on your Scottish history! The answer is GOLF!

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Ya know, this has inspired me! Maybe I'll find a tree and make my own caber right here!

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
Since I don't imagine you'd be open to turning the Peaceful Meadow into a golf course anytime soon...

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Aye, well done! The only sport that leaves time for business!

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Afraid not. Though it may have started in Scotland... there's no hitting sticks involved, just sweeping rocks.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Sufferin' Scots! No Scottish sports?!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
