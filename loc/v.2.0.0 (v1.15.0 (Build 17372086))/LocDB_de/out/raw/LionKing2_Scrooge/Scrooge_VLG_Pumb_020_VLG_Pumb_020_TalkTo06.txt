Hey, Mr. McDuck!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I need some supplies for an art show!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I have a business opportunity for you...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're clearly a fellow of culture!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
An art show, eh? Well, I do love a day at the museum â especially when I'M the one who donated all the pieces in the exhibition! Hee-hee.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Pumbaa and some friends made some pottery pieces, and we need something to display them on.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Well, {PlayerName}, you're in luck! It just so happens that I need supplies for a little project of my own.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
I've got some very nice display pillars, which are just the thing for you. And I'll trade 'em for some <Lore>gemstones and flowers</Lore> from around the Valley.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Okay, I'll <Lore>collect what we need to make the trade</Lore>.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Well, you certainly know how to capture my attention. What's this venture of yours?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Aye, I am an appreciator of the fine arts. But there's no need to butter me up. What's on your mind?
