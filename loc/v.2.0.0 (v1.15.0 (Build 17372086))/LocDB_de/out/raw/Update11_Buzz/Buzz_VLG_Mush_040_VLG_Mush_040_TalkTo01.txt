Hey, Buzz... has Scar been bothering you lately?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Hmm... Although Scar and I settled things amicably in regards to our friendship...

TAG: Buzz_003_f
...sometimes he pushes the boundaries of friendship too far.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That sounds bad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What does that even MEAN?

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Well, it isn't pleasant.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Lately, Scar seems to enjoy knocking me into mud puddles. One bat of his paw and I go flying.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
It takes me hours to get the mud out of the buttons on my uniform.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Sometimes days!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Does he at least apologize?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe it's accidental?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Mushu was right...

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Negative. He laughs and saunters away.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
I'm sorry this happened, Buzz. Mushu and I are going to work on a solution.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
An optimistic but unlikely explanation. He always laughs right after it happens.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Mushu?

TAG: Buzz_012_f
He said he's got a feeling Scar is picking on smaller Villagers... I have to report back to him.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
It means... And this is tough for me to say...

TAG: Buzz_002_f
... Scar is a villain. His interactions with me recently have done nothing to convince me otherwise!
