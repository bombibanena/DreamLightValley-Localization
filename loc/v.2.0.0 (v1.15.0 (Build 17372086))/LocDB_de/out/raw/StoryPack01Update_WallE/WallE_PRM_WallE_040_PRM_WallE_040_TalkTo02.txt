OK, let's see... Oh! Look at the title!

TAG: WallE_000_f
Huh?

TAG: WallE_037_f
This is called "A Fable for WALLÂ·E"!

TAG: WallE_038_f
Whoa!

TAG: WallE_039_f
Looks like I brought it to the right robot!

TAG: WallE_040_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_041_f
All right, let's start the story!

TAG: WallE_008_f
"Once upon a time, there was a brave..."

TAG: WallE_009_f
Hmm, I can't really read this next part.

TAG: WallE_010_f
Huh. Oh.

TAG: WallE_042_f
Oh cool, you've got a little boot plant!

TAG: WallE_011_f
I guess the book has been lost for long enough that there was some damage to the pages.

TAG: WallE_012_f
*sigh*

TAG: WallE_013_f
Don't worry; I'll just have to be creative!

TAG: WallE_014_f
"Once upon a time, there was a braveâ"

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Robot!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Knight.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Ruler.

TAG: WallE_030_f
Hmm, it does look kinda rough...

TAG: WallE_001_f
*sigh*

TAG: WallE_002_f
Don't be sad! We'll figure this out!

TAG: WallE_003_f
Whew... Directive?

TAG: WallE_004_f
Do you mean... this book used to be connected to this plant somehow?

TAG: WallE_005_f
Merlin was telling me all about story magic the other day... If the book has something to do with the plant, what if we try reading to it?

TAG: WallE_006_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_015_f
Whoa!

TAG: WallE_016_f
Hey, it's your plant â why not make the story about you?

TAG: WallE_017_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_032_f
"Once upon a time, there was a brave robot!"

TAG: WallE_027_f
I'll keep an eye out for more pages â maybe if we read to the plant a little more, it will fully recover.

TAG: WallE_029_f
Since I found the book on the Beach, I'll keep looking around there and the <ActivityItem>Peaceful Meadow</ActivityItem> â maybe some of the pages are there.

TAG: WallE_028_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_022_f
"Who cared deeply about the people and the natural world around them."

TAG: WallE_023_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_024_f
Hmm, it ends there. Looks like most of the pages have fallen out of the book...

TAG: WallE_026_f
The plant looks better already! The magic in that story must be really strong â we should try to track down the rest of it.

TAG: WallE_025_f
Oh.

TAG: WallE_031_f
Until then, why don't you keep it in your House? I bet it will be safe there.

TAG: WallE_033_f
"Once upon a time, there was a brave knight!"

TAG: WallE_034_f
"Once upon a time, there was a brave ruler!"

TAG: WallE_018_f
Oh!

TAG: WallE_019_f
Let's keep it classic, you know?

TAG: WallE_020_f
Oooh.

TAG: WallE_021_f
Hey, if I'm reading the story, I get to make it about me!
