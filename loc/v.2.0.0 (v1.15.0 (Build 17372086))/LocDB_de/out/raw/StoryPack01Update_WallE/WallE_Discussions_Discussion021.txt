WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_001_f
You still trying to do some matchmaking?

TAG: WallE_002_f
Uhh...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're done with matchmaking?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're doing something similar to matchmaking?

TAG: WallE_003_f
No!

TAG: WallE_004_f
Something similar... Are you trying to help people be better friends?

TAG: WallE_005_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_006_f
That's so cool! Who are you helping out now?

TAG: WallE_007_f
Uh... hmm.

TAG: WallE_008_f
If you need help picking people, I can help you out!

TAG: WallE_009_f
Whoopee!

TAG: Player_001_f
What about...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Mickey?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Remy?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Merlin?

TAG: WallE_010_f
Whoa!

TAG: WallE_011_f
He's really friendly. It shouldn't be too hard to introduce him to a new buddy!

TAG: Player_002_f
What if he could be better friends with...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Buzz?!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maui?!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Woody?!

TAG: WallE_012_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_013_f
They could learn a lot from each other.

TAG: WallE_014_f
And that's a great basis for friendship.

TAG: WallE_015_f
*whistle* *whistle*

TAG: WallE_016_f
Oh... oh!

TAG: WallE_017_f
Remy makes friends easily â especially if they're food lovers.

TAG: WallE_018_f
Ooh!

TAG: WallE_019_f
Merlin is friendly, but he spends so much time researching...

TAG: WallE_020_f
*whistle*
