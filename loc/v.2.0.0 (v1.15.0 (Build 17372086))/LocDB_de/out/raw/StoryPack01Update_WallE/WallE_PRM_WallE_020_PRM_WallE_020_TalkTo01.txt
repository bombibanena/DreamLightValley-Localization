Look at that...

TAG: WallE_001_f
Whoa!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Nothing like a picturesque beach!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm more inclined to candlelit dinners, to be honest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Personally, not a fan of the mushy stuff.

TAG: WallE_004_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_002_f
So what's next?

TAG: WallE_003_f
Directive.

TAG: WallE_010_f
Well, I guess if we're going to create magic moments for Villagers... we need to find some Villagers!

TAG: WallE_012_f
Who should we matchmake first?

TAG: WallE_013_f
Uh...

TAG: WallE_016_f
What about...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Mirabel!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Merlin!

TAG: WallE_017_f
*sigh* EVE-ah...

TAG: WallE_005_f
Oh, right. You already have your match.

TAG: WallE_018_f
Uh... No.

TAG: WallE_019_f
Whoo!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
All right, you're the boss!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
This should be interesting...

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
This is gonna be a train wreck, and I'm so on board for it.

TAG: WallE_021_f
Good call â Merlin always has his nose in a book; he needs a change of pace.

TAG: WallE_023_f
But who to set him up with?

TAG: WallE_024_f
You seem to be looking in the direction of the Giant Willow in the Glade of Trust. You can't possibly mean... Mother Gothel?!

TAG: WallE_029_f
*beep* *beep*

TAG: WallE_035_f
I don't think they're really compatible.

TAG: WallE_036_f
In fact, they don't seem to get along well at all.

TAG: WallE_037_f
I can think of some other pairings if you want...?

TAG: WallE_038_f
Aww...

TAG: WallE_040_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_030_f
Let's make some fancy invitations!

TAG: WallE_031_f
If we get them excited for a get-together, there are more chances that it will go well!

TAG: WallE_032_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_039_f
Let's see, for the invitations we should need <ActivityItem>Purple Marsh Milkweed</ActivityItem> and an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem> for the ink.

TAG: WallE_044_f
Some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> for the paper, and then finally craft the two of them together!

TAG: WallE_041_f
Ooh!

TAG: WallE_042_f
Uh-oh...

TAG: WallE_006_f
Nothing against your tastes, though!

TAG: WallE_007_f
Whew.

TAG: WallE_009_f
But I'm glad you like it!
