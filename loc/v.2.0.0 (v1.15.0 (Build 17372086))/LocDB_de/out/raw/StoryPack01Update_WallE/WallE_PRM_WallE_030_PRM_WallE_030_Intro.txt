What's going on, WALLÂ·E?

TAG: WallE_001_f
Directive! Directive?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Oh? Are we playing matchmaker again?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sorry, I can't help you right now.

TAG: WallE_003_f
Uhh... No.

TAG: WallE_004_f
A new directive?! OK, let's try and figure this out.

TAG: WallE_005_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_006_f
You seem excited â is that part of the hint?

TAG: WallE_007_f
Oh!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You want to put together a new outfit for yourself?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You want to have a dance?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You need a hug?

TAG: WallE_010_f
No.

TAG: WallE_011_f
Oh! Oh!

TAG: WallE_013_f
That's a great idea. You need time to let loose, too.

TAG: WallE_014_f
First thing we need for a party are guests â do you have anyone in mind?

TAG: WallE_015_f
Uh... Ah...

TAG: WallE_016_f
What about...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Merlin and Mother Gothel?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Mirabel and Woody?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Mickey and Minnie?

TAG: WallE_017_f
No!

TAG: WallE_018_f
You're right. If they're going to learn to get along, they'll have to do that on their own.

TAG: WallE_027_f
What about Mirabel and Woody?

TAG: WallE_019_f
Ooh! Oh!

TAG: WallE_020_f
Good choice!

TAG: WallE_026_f
Time to pay them a visit!

TAG: WallE_021_f
Uhh...

TAG: WallE_022_f
I guess not. Well, there are other folks in the Valley.

TAG: WallE_002_f
What about Mirabel and Woody?

TAG: WallE_012_f
Aww... Uh... No.
