Ooh, looks like we're here in the nick of time.

TAG: WallE_001_f
That poor plant!

TAG: WallE_002_f
Aww...

TAG: WallE_003_f
Let's see, during the last story time, we learned about our hero.

TAG: WallE_004_f
A hard worker trying to improve their home, only too aware that something was missing in their life.

TAG: WallE_005_f
*sigh*

TAG: WallE_006_f
But let's see what happens next!

TAG: WallE_007_f
"One day, the robot was graced by a vision of beauty!"

TAG: WallE_008_f
Oh!

TAG: WallE_009_f
"As glistening and clean as the robot was worn and soiled by their labors."

TAG: WallE_010_f
"The robot was astounded â they had never seen anything so lovely!"

TAG: WallE_011_f
Aww...

TAG: WallE_012_f
"They gave the vision a gift â their most rare and precious treasure, a..."

TAG: WallE_013_f
Hmm, this part is illegible. But I think the gift should be...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A magical ring!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A fantastic sword!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A beautiful flower!

TAG: WallE_014_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_015_f
"But a terrible spell was cast on the vision of beauty!"

TAG: WallE_016_f
AH!

TAG: WallE_017_f
Hey, I'm just reading what's written down!

TAG: WallE_018_f
"And the robot wept to see their heart stolen from them."

TAG: WallE_026_f
I gotta say, there's something about this story that feels oddly familiar.

TAG: WallE_027_f
I can't put my finger on it though â maybe if we find the next part, it will become clearer!

TAG: WallE_028_f
I'll check the <ActivityItem>Sunlit Plateau</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Frosted Heights</ActivityItem> next â maybe the last batch of pages will be around there!

TAG: WallE_029_f
Whoo!

TAG: WallE_019_f
No!

TAG: WallE_020_f
Yeah, it is a little sad. But sometimes stories have sad parts so that the hero's success is even greater!

TAG: WallE_021_f
Huh?

TAG: WallE_022_f
I'm afraid that's all the pages I found.

TAG: WallE_023_f
*sigh*

TAG: WallE_024_f
Your plant is looking better, though! I bet you it can hang on while I find the last part of the story.

TAG: WallE_025_f
Directive!

TAG: WallE_030_f
"And the knight wept to see their heart stolen from them."

TAG: WallE_031_f
"And the ruler wept to see their heart stolen from them."

TAG: WallE_032_f
"As glistening and bright as the knight was worn and soiled by their labors."

TAG: WallE_033_f
"The knight was astounded â they had never seen anything so lovely in their long life!"

TAG: WallE_034_f
"As glistening and bright as the ruler was worn and soiled by their labors."

TAG: WallE_035_f
"The ruler was astounded â they had never seen anything so lovely in their long life!"

TAG: WallE_036_f
"One day, the knight was graced by a vision of beauty!"

TAG: WallE_037_f
"One day, the ruler was graced by a vision of beauty!"
