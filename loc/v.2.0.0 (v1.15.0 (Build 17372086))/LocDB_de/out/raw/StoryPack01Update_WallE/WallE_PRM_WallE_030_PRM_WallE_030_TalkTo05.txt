WALLÂ·E! I think we're ready to go!

TAG: WallE_009_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_010_f
<ActivityItem>Paths</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Lighting</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Traditional Decorations</ActivityItem> should do it!

TAG: WallE_011_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_012_f
So... after that are you ready to let loose?

TAG: WallE_013_f
Hmm... No.

TAG: WallE_014_f
No?! What do you need now?

TAG: WallE_022_f
Ta-da!

TAG: WallE_023_f
Wait... this is for me? These outfits are beautiful!

TAG: WallE_024_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_001_f
Mirabel and Woody are on their way.

TAG: WallE_025_f
Aww, WALLÂ·E, this is too nice!

TAG: WallE_026_f
Did Mirabel help make these? I guess now I see why she needed all that stuff...

TAG: WallE_027_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_028_f
All right, time to get fancy and decorate for the dance!

TAG: WallE_002_f
And Goofy is feeling up to it again!

TAG: WallE_003_f
Whoa! Whoo!

TAG: WallE_004_f
What are we thinking for decorations?

TAG: WallE_005_f
We can't have a party without some dÃ©cor to set the mood.

TAG: WallE_006_f
Hmm... *sigh*

TAG: WallE_007_f
What's wrong? Not sure about decorating?

TAG: WallE_008_f
Don't worry; I can help you out with that.
