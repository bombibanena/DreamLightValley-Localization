WALLÂ·E! I tried to distract Ursula and get you as much time as I could!

TAG: WallE_001_f
Whew!

TAG: WallE_002_f
Any luck finding that <ActivityItem>Scrap Metal</ActivityItem> on your end?

TAG: WallE_003_f
Ta-da!

TAG: WallE_004_f
Great job!

TAG: WallE_005_f
Whoo!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Were you scared?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm impressed!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I hope Ursula doesn't notice that they're gone...

TAG: WallE_006_f
Uh...

TAG: WallE_007_f
It's okay; it's only natural!

TAG: WallE_008_f
Whew!

TAG: WallE_009_f
I think you're really brave. Now...

TAG: WallE_016_f
Between the pieces we found on the Beach, the one Goofy told us about, and those we got from Ursula...

TAG: WallE_015_f
Now we can fix up the trash can lid for you!

TAG: WallE_020_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_010_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_011_f
Uh?

TAG: WallE_012_f
Uh-oh...

TAG: WallE_013_f
Don't worry; with any luck, Ursula will be focusing on her gift.

TAG: WallE_014_f
Whew!
