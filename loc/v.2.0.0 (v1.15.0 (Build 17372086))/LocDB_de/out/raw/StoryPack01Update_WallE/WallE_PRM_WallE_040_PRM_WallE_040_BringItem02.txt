WALLÂ·E! I'm back!

TAG: WallE_002_f
Hello!

TAG: WallE_004_f
And I've got more pages from the story!

TAG: WallE_005_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_006_f
Ready for the next part of "A Fable for WALLÂ·E"?

TAG: WallE_007_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_008_f
OK, let's see...

TAG: WallE_009_f
Last time we had introduced a brave robot...

TAG: WallE_012_f
Aww...

TAG: WallE_013_f
"Every day they worked hard, from dawn until dusk..."

TAG: WallE_014_f
"Determined to make their home a better and better place to live."

TAG: WallE_015_f
Ooh...

TAG: WallE_016_f
"But they knew that something was missing..."

TAG: WallE_017_f
"There was an emptiness inside them that they didn't know how to fillâ"

TAG: WallE_018_f
"No matter how hard they worked."

TAG: WallE_019_f
*sigh*

TAG: WallE_020_f
Yeah, poor robot!

TAG: WallE_028_f
Whoo!

TAG: WallE_023_f
But I'm afraid that's all I found for now.

TAG: WallE_024_f
Oh...

TAG: WallE_025_f
Wow, look at your plant! I think it liked more of the story!

TAG: WallE_026_f
Whoa!

TAG: WallE_001_f
I'll check some of the other parts of the Valley.

TAG: WallE_003_f
Directive!

TAG: WallE_027_f
Hang in there, little plant! Maybe I can find more pages in the <ActivityItem>Forest of Valor</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Glade of Trust</ActivityItem>!

TAG: WallE_021_f
Yeah, poor knight!

TAG: WallE_022_f
Yeah, poor ruler!

TAG: WallE_010_f
Last time we had introduced a brave knight...

TAG: WallE_011_f
Last time, we had introduced a brave ruler...
