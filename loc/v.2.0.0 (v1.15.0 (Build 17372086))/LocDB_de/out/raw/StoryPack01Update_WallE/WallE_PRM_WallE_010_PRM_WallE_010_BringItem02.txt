Here you go â one <ActivityItem>Trash Can Lid</ActivityItem>, as promised!

TAG: WallE_001_f
Whoopee! ... *whistle*

TAG: WallE_019_f
Wait... you're gesturing to your head. You want to use the <ActivityItem>Trash Can Lid</ActivityItem> as a hat?

TAG: WallE_014_f
Ta-da!

TAG: WallE_021_f
You want to give it to me?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But we worked so hard for you to have it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you sure?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
WALLÂ·E, I can't accept this...

TAG: WallE_010_f
Uh...

TAG: WallE_020_f
Well, if this is what you want, who am I to say no?

TAG: WallE_015_f
And I guess you do already have a dapper little hat!

TAG: WallE_009_f
Whoo!

TAG: WallE_016_f
Why don't I put it on, and we can take some pictures together to commemorate our little adventure?

TAG: WallE_017_f
Oh!

TAG: WallE_018_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_011_f
*whistle* *whistle*

TAG: WallE_012_f
*sigh*
