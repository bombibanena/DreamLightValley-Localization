{PlayerName}! Thank goodness you're here! I need your help with a potentially... supernatural matter.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
I was exploring the Dream Castle looking for hidden rooms and treasure troves when...

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Bless me bagpipes â I think I saw a ghost!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Dream Castle is haunted?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're scaring me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There's no such thing as ghosts.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Aye, it's possible! My ancestral home, Castle McDuck, had ghosts and apparitions clear to the rafters!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
But this specter looked different than any ghost I've seen before. It flickered in and out of sight.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Since you're an adventurer like me, I want your second opinion. Could ya <Lore>go to the Dream Castle and look for the ghost?</Lore>

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
I last saw it <Lore>at the very top of the stairs next to the fountain!</Lore>

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Och. There's no need to be frightened of ghosts. Why, back in Scotland, Castle McDuck is rife with my formerly living relatives.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Dinnae be so skeptical! Back in Scotland, Castle McDuck's filled with spirits aplenty! Mostly my relatives who've passed on.
