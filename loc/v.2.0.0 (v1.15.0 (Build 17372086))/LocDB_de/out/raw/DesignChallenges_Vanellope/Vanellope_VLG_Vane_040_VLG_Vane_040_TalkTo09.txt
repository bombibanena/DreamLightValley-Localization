Ah-ha! You've returned, and I see you have the first key! That means you proved yourself to Chockany Gumbottom in a duel.

It was fun!

As you think about the fun you had, the air around you starts to sparkle. For a second... everything is amazing!

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Then... everything drops back into gray, blah boredom again. It's the worst! There's more hero-ing to do!

The key in your possession is connected to the others. You can feel it <Lore>calling out to the second key, deep in the Mystical Cave.</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Beware, Hero! That key is guarded! And you might find your welcome... chilling...

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Our Hero feels VERY confident about what challenges lie ahead but... they might soon change their tune.

The only thing sweeter than victory is Chockany's spellcasting. And with that taste still lingering, the Hero sets their sights on the next part of the journey...
