Well done, my chum! Now you're dressed for adventure.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
The first step in your journey is simple: <Lore>Head to the Rat's Inn!</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
(All good adventures start at an inn!)

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Where is this inn?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The Valley has no inns...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
An inn for rats?

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Okay, it's not REALLY an inn. For this adventure, you gotta use your imagination.

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
When you get to the Inn, go inside and <Lore>look for a wizard!</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
The Wizard is very old and very wrinkly â that means "wise"! You'll get help on your quest to save the kingdom from mind-numbing boredom!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Good luck, Hero!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Correct, but it does have a fine establishment owned by a rat. Use your imagination...

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Ha-ha! That would be ridiculously tiny and cute!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
But sadly... no. This is a regular-sized building owned by a rat... Got it?
