Hey, {PlayerName}, how come people here eat stuff that comes out of the ground?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The five-second rule?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Who's eating stuff out of the ground?

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
The what? Listen, this food has been in the ground for WAY longer than five seconds!

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
You mess around in the dirt, add water, then you pick stuff out of the ground and eat it! What is with that?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Are you talking about farming?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You've never seen vegetable gardens before?

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Farming?! Wait â farming is real?!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
I thought it was just a thing in simulator games!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What did you think they were simulating?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
We need to get you outdoors more!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You sweet, sheltered child.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Uhh... a world without video games? I don't know. I never really thought about it.

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Yeah, outside IS pretty neat! I especially like the wild animals and extreme sports.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Aw c'mon, aren't we all just basically zeroes and ones floating around the universe like tiny specks of dust?

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Wait â vegetables are REAL?!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
I thought they only existed in farming simulators!

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
You! I've seen you do it!
