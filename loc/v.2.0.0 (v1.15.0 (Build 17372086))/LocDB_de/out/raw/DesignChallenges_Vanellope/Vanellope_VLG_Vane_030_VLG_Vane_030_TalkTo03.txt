That boss battle was AMAZING!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Remember the part where she threatened us?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We made her really mad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We definitely lost that battle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We need a better strategy.

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Yeah, you made the right choice to leave. She was gonna turn us into fish food. Hilarious!

My buddy Tammy's from this really intense battle game, and she likes to say, "Retreat is a strategy! Surrender is not!"

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
So, for the NEXT one we're gonna have to level up and think smart to get the advantage!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What do I need to do?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe "battling" more villains is a bad idea...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You sure you're not out of touch with reality?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
So glad you asked, my heroic chum!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
It's time to begin preparations for our Final Battle. You're a magical hero, which means you need a magical kinda weapon!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Go <Lore>find your mystical sword in the Forest of Valor.</Lore>

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Where did you find this sword?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What are YOU going to do?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Will it give me magic powers?!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
I have a LOT of free time on my hands. So you COULD say I made it myself and hid it in the woods.

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
<Lore>Find the sword in the Forest of Valor!</Lore> I'm gonna go battle the Witch in the Tree.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Preeeeetty sure she's low level, and she'll drop some good power-ups!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
I've got my own quest!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
You already HAVE Dreamlight Magic, duh! This is a homemade sword, just for you!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
SO bad that it's good, right?

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Pff, who needs REALITY? We have that all day every day!

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself, champ. It was your first boss battle EVER!

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
Listen, don't feel too bad. Sometimes you gotta run away if your level isn't high enough yet.
