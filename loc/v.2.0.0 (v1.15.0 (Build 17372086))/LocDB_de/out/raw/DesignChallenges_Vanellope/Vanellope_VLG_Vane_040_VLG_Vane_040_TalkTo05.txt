The Hero returns to their Storyteller with the second key in hand. Marshmafrost Mintwizzle has been bested!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
The Hero needs one more key to unlock the chest and save the kingdom...

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
But the Princess has the final key, and she's in the clutches of the evil Mastermind in his monster maze!

I will do what I must!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Where is the Mastermind? I'm ready!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Finally, a challenge!

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Of course you will, Hero!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
You have gone from humble Farmer to wizard-besting, snow-beast-battling champion! BUT you must still prepare!

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
<Lore>Arm yourself with your Pixel Sword and brew some potions!</Lore>

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
After that, <Lore>search for a Bestiary in Arendelle Castle!</Lore> That's an old book on creatures that will give you the edge on the fun-gobbling Mastermind!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
When you're ready, go to the TRUE QUESTINATION! ... The Mines on the Sunlit Plateau!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Your tinkering and smarts have helped you thus far, Futurist! But there is much to prepare before your battle!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
You have fought wizards and snow beasts, and you're worthy of your title! But even heroes must prepare.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Hold your horses, Hero!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
I like this fighting spirit, Hero!
