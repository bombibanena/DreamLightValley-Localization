Yeah! I've been talking to some of the other Villagers about this whole Forgetting thing.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
But none of them can remember exactly what happened.

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Was the Forgetting like someone unplugged the Valley? Did the Valley stop existing?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's more like the Forgetting is a glitch.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No one could ever unplug the Valley!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not everything is video games.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Hey! A glitch doesn't have to be bad, you know.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
True. The Forgetting brought the Village together.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sorry, I didn't mean it that way!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Really? I thought most glitches were bad.

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Without it, the Villagers wouldn't be as close now.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Huh... Kind of like how my glitch makes me a great racer!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
I know, {PlayerName}. Don't worry. We're good.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Not mine. I love it!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Okay... so, the Valley was here all along, waiting for everyone to come back...

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Good to know I'll always have a place to crash.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Are you sure about that? There are video games for everything these days!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Even feeding milkshakes to cats! It's bonkers!
