{PlayerName}, do you ever wish something new and different would happen?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I want every day to be different!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sometimes...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
New things are scary.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Right?! Sometimes, you just need to break up the same old, same old!

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Like... I don't know. What do you really get excited about, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The Internet.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Running really, really fast.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Checkers.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Me too! You know I've been there, right? That place is bonkers!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Yes! There's nothin' better than feeling the wind through the candy stuck in your hair.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
You mean like on racing flags and finish lines? 'Cause those are great!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Sometimes? You mean like Wednesdays and Fridays between 10:00 and 2:00?

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
How often are we talking about here? Ballpark it for me.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
When I'm bored.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
When I least expect it!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
When the Valley is under control!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
I'm with ya! You don't need a new track until you've unlocked every secret in the old ones. Am I right?

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Yes! That's the best! Way to live on the wild side, pal.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Ha! Like that'll ever happen. This place is wild! You probably should just roll with it.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Well, yeah! But you gotta have excitement in your life. That's worth a little scary.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
You're right! A little fear is worth it.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'd rather be safe and secure!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
Exactly! Gettin' out of your comfort zone makes you feel alive!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
You sound like my buddy Ralph. So I understand.

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
He learned that some change can be good, but he still really likes his routine.
