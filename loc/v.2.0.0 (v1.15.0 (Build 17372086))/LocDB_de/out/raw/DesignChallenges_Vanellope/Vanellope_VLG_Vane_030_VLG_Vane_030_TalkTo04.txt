Hey, so I didn't get any cool power-ups... Turns out the Tree Witch was a total dud.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm so stressed for you right now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Seems like a good time to end this...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She walked away? That means you won!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Pff, don't worry. I've been to the Internet and played games there. I've finished tutorials more dangerous than some cranky swamp lady. Besides...

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
You have your Pixel Sword, and we have the experience. I think we're ready to take on the Final Boss... Scar!

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Scar? What makes Scar the final boss?

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Uh, his lair is a GINORMOUS SKULL. Duh!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Actually, this sounds fun! I'm in!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm not ready to enter the actual lion's den...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You know Scar is always hungry, right?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Woo-hoo! Game on, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Here's what I'm thinking... We make a lure to bring him into his lair... and then we attack.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
I've been playing a LOT of Extreme Fishing lately. So I know we'll need <ActivityItem>Herring</ActivityItem> for the trap because they're super stinky! Perfect for a scent lure!

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
We'll also need a <ActivityItem>Kingfish</ActivityItem> to catch a wannabe king! Pretty sure you can find those on Dazzle Beach late at night.

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
And... uh... some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Fiber</ActivityItem> to put the whole thing together.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
<Lore>Build the Scar Lure and place it near his den.</Lore> Then, pow! Final Boss time!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Sure you are! We just need a good plan...

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
So am I! For victory!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
No way! We're just getting to the good part. The FINAL BOSS!

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Kind of a hollow victory against an unthreatening swamp lady. Anyway...
