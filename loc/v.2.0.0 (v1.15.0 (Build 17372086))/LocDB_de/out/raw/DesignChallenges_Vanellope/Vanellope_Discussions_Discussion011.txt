So glad you asked! I can think of lots of things to make this place even more fun.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Ramps, a Candy Bar... or the Internet!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ramps?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A Candy Bar?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The Internet?

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Yeah, for doing turbo jumps!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Seems a little dangerous...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds fun! Where would we put them?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're going to break a bone.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Exactly! You get it!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Everywhere! On the cliffs to jump into the sea... or over Merlin's House!

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Trust me. Everyone'll love it.

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
If you mean a pixel, don't worry. I'll just regenerate. Happens all the time.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Yeah! You put a special candy on the ground in a line. When someone runs over it, they get a seriously turbo speed boost!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Sounds kinda... sticky.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What kind of candy do we need?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
This sounds like an accident waiting to happen.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Just the opposite, friendo. How could you go fast if it was sticky?

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Any? All! Just start throwin' candy on the ground and get back to me, 'kay?

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
Nope. Just a lot of fun.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Yeah! Get the Internet. Then all the Villagers can go and visit.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
The Internet is a place?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
What can you do on the Internet?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
What about just getting fresh air?

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
Uh, yeah!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
If it wasn't a place, why would webSITES have ADDRESSES?

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Get all your questions answered by KnowsMore, and get into a bidding war for rare nerd junk.

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
Plus, I bet you didn't know this...

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
You can play a TON of games on the Internet.

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
Huh... Sounds good.

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
There must be a website where you can order that.
