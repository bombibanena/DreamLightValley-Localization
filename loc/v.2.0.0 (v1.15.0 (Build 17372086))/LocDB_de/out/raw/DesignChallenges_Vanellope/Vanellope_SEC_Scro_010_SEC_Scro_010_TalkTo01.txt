Finally! Somebody's here!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Wait! Wait! I've been rehearsing for this moment...

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Greetings! I am Vanellope von Schweetz, princess and president of Sugar Rush, and Slaughter Race driver extraordinaire!

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Soooo... Who're you? And what's this freakishly sparkling place?

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
I'm {PlayerName}, and this is Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How come you're here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
So you're NOT a ghost?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Technically, I'm not here. I don't think I'm ANYWHERE, actually. Or I'm everywhere... That's the thing â I don't know!

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Normally I have complete control over my glitch. But one day, POW! I glitched onto this freaky network I've never seen before.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Now I'm stuck. I have no control, and I don't know why!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Magic and technology don't always mix.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That sounds kind of scary...

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Maybe the Dreamlight Magic here is messing with your glitch?

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Ugh. Why am I not surprised that a place called "Dreamlight Alley" is lousy with magic?!

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
There's got to be some way I can help you...

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Well, do you have one of those doohickeys where you talk into it and it takes pictures? 'Cause I have an idea.

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
Do you mean a phone...?

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
Yeah, that's it! I'm seeing a lot of photos being shared on the network I'm stuck in...

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
If you <Lore>try taking a picture and sharing it on the network,</Lore> maybe we can see what it's all about.

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
But hey, leave the Castle and take a picture of something awesome, will ya? Show me what I'm missing!

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
C'mon! You can't say no to this face. Look how adorable I am!

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
Aw, I'm not scared, I'm just... really frustrated! I like to have both hands on the wheel!

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
Do I look okay to you? I'm glitching all over the place!

TAG: Vanellope_019_f
Not unless I died of boredom from glitching everywhere.
