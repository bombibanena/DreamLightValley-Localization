Mr. McDuck, ya think I could borrow a coin for my next race entry?

Surely a capable racer such as yourself has won many a coin already?

Of course, I'm the best! But, hey, I know a good shortcut when I see one.

Take my advice, lassie. Dinnae rely on shortcuts. The full-hearted pursuit of gold and glory is what leads to adventure!

Kinda sounds like you need a lesson in sharing, but sure. Chasing gold and glory it is!
