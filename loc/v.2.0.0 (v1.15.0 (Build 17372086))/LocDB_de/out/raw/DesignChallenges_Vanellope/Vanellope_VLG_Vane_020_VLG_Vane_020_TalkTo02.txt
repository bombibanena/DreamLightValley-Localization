Who knew racing without wheels could be so fun?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes! That was awesome!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're wild, Vanellope!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Running is pain.

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
So glad you agree, chum! Now...

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
We need one more game to round out my Mini-Game Gauntlet!

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
I think you'll like this one. We're gonna play...

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
EXTREME FISHING!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Bring it! I'm a pro angler!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
This better not involve dynamite...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Like... fishing but more extreme?

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Pro Angler was a GREAT fishing sim in the arcade! Not as cool as Super Bass 3000, but pretty challenging.

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
You played fishing games?

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Not even a little.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Here're the rules... <Lore>The game starts as soon as you leave the Mine! You only have three minutes to catch three fish!</Lore> Your goal is to convince me that fishing can be fun.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I got it! Let's fish!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Explain it to me again?

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Yes! Get out there and fish extremely! I'll tell you when your time's up.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
It's simple! As soon as you leave this Mine, I'll start the timer.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
You can fish anywhere in the Valley. Just <Lore>catch three fish in three minutes.</Lore> I'll let you know when the time's up!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
C'mon, go! Go! Go!

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
I didn't know you could fish with dynamite! That's a thing?

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
You know what? Forget I asked.

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
I'll have questions on that later, but now it's Extreme Fishing time!

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
Exactly (and also obviously)! Hold on to your bass because this ISN'T Mega Salmon Wrangler.

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
... That's an arcade game where I come from. ANYWAY...

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
You haven't seen anything yet!

TAG: Vanellope_019_f
Got a case of the ol' licorice legs, huh? Well buck up, bucko! We're not done yet!
