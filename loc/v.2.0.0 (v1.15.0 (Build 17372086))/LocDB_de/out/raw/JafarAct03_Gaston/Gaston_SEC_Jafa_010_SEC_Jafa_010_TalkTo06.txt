Hey Gaston, got a moment to talk about Jafar?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
How strange. I was just talking with him earlier.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Oh yeah? Was he mean? Nice? Somewhere in the middle?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
He was finally behaving right â he brought me a gift!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How kind of him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Was this gift a snake statue with glowing eyes?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
And it was even a gift I wanted.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Jafar gave me a set of weights! He said he saw me with coconut-based exercise equipment so he made me something more solid.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
He also complimented me on my clothes. Said something about how <Lore>red and black</Lore> were noble colors.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's quite unexpected!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Wow, really seems like he's making an effort!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I agree. I never thought someone with such skinny arms would even know the word "exercise."

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Anything else about your dealings with him that you'd like to pass along?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Hmm... Yes! He also complimented me!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
He said I was incredibly strong!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Yeah? What was the context?

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Well, I was trying out the weights, swinging them around, and I nearly hit myself in the head.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
I said something like "good thing that didn't hit my head!" and he said that even if it did, I'd be fine since I was "incredibly thick-headed." See, he complimented my strength!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
... Yes, so nice of him.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That's an insult, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
He's all right, that Jafar!

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Okay, well thanks for answering my questions, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
You know, after hearing what everyone has told me... I think that maybe we should do something for Jafar.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Are you sure about that?

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Yeah, well, it's clear that Jafar is trying to ingratiate himself to everyone now.

TAG: Gaston_024_f
We should do something to show that we appreciate the effort.

TAG: Gaston_025_f
Should we give him some eggs?

TAG: Gaston_026_f
I wasn't thinking eggs. Let's see... he did kinda show his own interests with his gift choices â we should use that to start!

TAG: Gaston_027_f
I've got it! We'll decorate around the Palace with furniture that's <Lore>Red</Lore>, <Lore>Black</Lore>, <Lore>Elegant</Lore>, <Lore>Bold</Lore>, and <Lore>Traditional</Lore>!

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Maybe I should talk to Merlin to get a little something extra special too...

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Bye!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
But he said it so nicely! You must be mistaken.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I agree.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
I know better than to accept a gift like that! Now.
