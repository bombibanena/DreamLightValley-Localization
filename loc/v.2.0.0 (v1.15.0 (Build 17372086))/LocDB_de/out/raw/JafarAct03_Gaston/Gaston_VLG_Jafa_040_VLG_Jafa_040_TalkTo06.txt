Gaston, I need to talk to you about Jafar.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
We're going to be holding a trial for him andâ

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Ahh, and you want me to be the judge? Of course!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Never.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You are the last person I would ask.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
A mistake you'll regret, I'm sure. What do you want then?

TAG: Gaston_012_f
What if when I need to get the courtroom set up, I rely on you to move the heavy things?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I like it!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Well, I wanted to get your take on things. How do you feel about Jafar? Is there anything you want to raise when you testify?

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Hmm... I must confess; I'm conflicted. I don't like that he hypnotized me to do his bidding...

TAG: Gaston_006_f
For sure!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
BUT he did want me to move his extremely heavy equipment, so he clearly knows I'm the strongest person here.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
... For sure.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I believe he should answer for his crimes...

TAG: Gaston_010_f
...AND you should acknowledge that I'm amazingly strong.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Okay, I can work with this.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Okay, glad we sorted that out â talk to you later!
