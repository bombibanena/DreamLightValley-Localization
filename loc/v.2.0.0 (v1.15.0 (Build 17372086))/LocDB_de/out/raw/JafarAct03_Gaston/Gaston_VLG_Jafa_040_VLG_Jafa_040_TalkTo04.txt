The Dreamlight Court will now hear testimony from Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Umm, well... Jafar isn't the only one here that has done bad things.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
It will shock you to hear, but I have... on occasion... long in the past... done one or two things that MAY be considered... not good. Plus, Ursula, Scar, and Mother Gothel have all done MANY nasty things, and they're allowed to stay here.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
That's true... but have they done anything as bad as Jafar?

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I can't do EVERYTHING for you. You decide. You're the Your Honor judge.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
No, that's not how you say it, either... oh never mind.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Thank you for your testimony, Gaston. You can return to the bench.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
It's very simple, Your Glory.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Your Honor.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Huh?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
"Your Honor" is how you address a judge, not "Your Glory." Anyway, keep going.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
So yes, Jafar did hypnotize me. But, he also used me for a strength-related task, so I can't be THAT angry with him.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
You see, as the strongest member of this communityâ

The witness will cease self-aggrandizing and get to the point.
