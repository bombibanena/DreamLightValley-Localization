Do you see this... this thing?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
It's blocking my entire camp!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
It's pretty annoying. But I know just how we can fix it.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
We need to use our imaginations together and make something to throw inside of it.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Imagination?! Ha! Who needs imagination when you have strength? Courage? Cunning?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Gaston... are you SCARED to use your imagination?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
All of those things are useless to us right now.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Scared?! ME?! Of course not!

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I... I... well, all right. I'm not SCARED, but it is something I've never really done before.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
That sort of thing is more for Belle, or her father Maurice. You know â odd people.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Well, if it's something you've never done before... maybe you need an imagination coach?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
But who would be capable of coaching ME?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
I think I've got juuust the lucky rabbit we need.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
I'll go <Lore>ask Oswald</Lore>!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Useless?! Impossible!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
'Fraid so. Only the magic of imagination will help us close this rift.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
But I'm not sure I've ever used my imagination before.
