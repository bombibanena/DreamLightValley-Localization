Gaston, I've got a question for you, and I'm kind of afraid to know the answer. What's your heart's deepest wish?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
My heart's deepest wish?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
No one's ever asked me anything like that before. My heart has so many wishes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But what's the biggest one?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How do you fit them all in that tiny heart?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Don't think. Just answer.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Hmm...

TAG: Gaston_004_f
I suppose there is one thing I wish for most.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Of course I already have so many gifts. I'm handsome... strong... brave...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Don't forget humble...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not hearing a wish yet...

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Ah, yes, humble!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
I'm feared by some! Adored by the rest!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
But there is one person whose admiration eludes me.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
A certain brunette who spends too much time reading and getting ideas in her head.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Do you understand now, {PlayerName}? I wish that Belle could see me for who I truly am.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
That's... surprisingly deep for you, Gaston.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Have you ever heard the expression "there are plenty of other fish in the sea"?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Thanks for the wish, Gaston! That's all I needed!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Ugh. I know. I almost expressed... feelings... No! I need to go wrestle a bear or fight off bandits to banish this odd sensation.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
You do that! In the meantime, I need to keep helping Rapunzel!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I don't want a fish! I want Belle!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Gaston, it's just a metaphor... You know what? Don't worry about it. I need to get back to helping Rapunzel.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Wait! Does this mean my wish will be granted?! You never said that part!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
That isn't funny, {PlayerName}. I'll have you know my heart is nearly as large as my neck.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Okay, okay. If you've got so much room for wishes in that heart, just tell me one.
