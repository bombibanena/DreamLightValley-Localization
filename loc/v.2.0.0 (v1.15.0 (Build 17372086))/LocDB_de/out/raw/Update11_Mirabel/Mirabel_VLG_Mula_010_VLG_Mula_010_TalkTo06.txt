{PlayerName}, is what I've heard true?

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
Is Mulan back in the Village and having one of her teas?

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Yes, and you're invited.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Oh, I can't wait! I've missed those comfy afternoons sipping tea with my friends.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
What should I bring? Maybe a cake? TWO cakes?

TAG: Player_000_f
You don't need to bring anything...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...your presence is enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
There's no reason to stress.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Mulan just wants to see you.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
That's so sweet. Thank you.

TAG: Mirabel_000_f
I'll see you there!

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
Right. Of course. That makes sense. I mean, why would I be stressing about a little party?

TAG: Mirabel_010_f
*sigh* ... Maybe I do need a cup of tea.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
Of course. And I can't wait to see her!

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
It's been WAY too long!
