{PlayerName}, thanks again for helping with the materials but...

I'm not sure it's the best time for Sally to collaborate with Minnie and me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We'll find something different for Sally.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe something in the future?

Because it's your first home collection?

You absolutely must! She has SO many unique ideas... I'm just not sure they're right for the first EVER home decor line for "Dots & Daisies."

TAG: Daisy_005_f
Anyway, I'll give the materials back to Sally. I just know the two of you will come up with something fun for them!

TAG: Daisy_002_f
Oh, definitely! We all love Halloween, so I'm SURE we'll have a haunted house collection soon!

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Exactly! This first one really has to have our established style. But I'd love to collaborate with her in the future!
