Hey Daisy, can we talk for a moment?

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Of course! What do you want to talk about?

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Romance!

TAG: Daisy_005_f
Oooh, I'm always happy to talk about that!

TAG: Daisy_006_f
So I'm trying to help Sally and Jack get comfortable with each other again.

TAG: Daisy_007_f
They were apart for a while, and I think they need a little help to get back on the same page.

TAG: Daisy_008_f
I understand. Did you have anything in mind?

TAG: Daisy_010_f
Minnie suggested that I make some treats for them to share.

TAG: Daisy_016_f
Well, that's a great start! As long as it's the kind of treat that Jack and Sally both like.

TAG: Daisy_017_f
Hmm, not sure about that... I guess gingerbread isn't the most Halloween-y of treats.

TAG: Daisy_018_f
Well, there's an easy way to fix that â make the cookies in the shape of a skull!

TAG: Daisy_009_f
But a date needs more than just snacks. You could... <Lore>decorate with Halloween items</Lore> or even <Lore>include a variety of Halloween-themed food</Lore>!

TAG: Daisy_020_f
Great ideas, Daisy. I'll get started on that now!

TAG: Daisy_011_f
No, you're the first Villager I came to see.

TAG: Daisy_012_f
Well, aren't you smart? Coming to the best advice-giver in the Valley first!

TAG: Daisy_013_f
Now, let me think... Oh, I know! You could give them something they'll both like that they can share together.

TAG: Daisy_014_f
And for Jack and Sally, it should involve frightening imagery!

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Like a skull, or something Halloween-y.

TAG: Daisy_001_f
And that can apply to everything! You could <Lore>decorate with Halloween items</Lore> or even <Lore>include Halloween-themed food</Lore>!

TAG: Daisy_019_f
Perfect! Thanks, Daisy. I'll <Lore>see what Minnie has to say next</Lore>.
