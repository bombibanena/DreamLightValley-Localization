Hey, Daisy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Do you have any sewing project ideas?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Need any sewing help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How's your fashion line coming?

TAG: Daisy_005_f
Why, of course. I have dozens! A purple and pink tartan skirt with a back bow, an entire athleisure set with lace trim... I could go on.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
Why do you ask?

TAG: Daisy_007_f
Sally's looking for a new sewing project. I thought you and Minnie might have some ideas for her.

TAG: Daisy_016_f
Actually, I have an even BETTER thought! Why don't you and Sally join Minnie and me on our next project?

TAG: Daisy_009_f
We're thinking: home decor. You know â throw pillows, curtains, the whole works.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
I'm sure Minnie will agree that you and Sally would be the perfect collaborators!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What do we need to get started?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sally will be so happy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Do you actually THROW throw pillows?

TAG: Daisy_012_f
I'll give you a list of supplies. Would you mind <Lore>collecting them for us</Lore>?

TAG: Daisy_015_f
In the meantime, I need to grab my design sketches. Then we'll <Lore>meet at Minnie's place</Lore>!

TAG: Daisy_011_f
Well, I'm thrilled! Sally has such fantastic style. I'm sure we'll come up with something unforgettable.

TAG: Daisy_013_f
Sometimes. If Donald's being especially frustrating. *giggle*

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Now, there's lots of work to do!

TAG: Daisy_002_f
As a matter of fact, I do! Minnie and I are planning a new project for "Dots & Daisies," but it's a little ambitious for just the two of us...

TAG: Daisy_004_f
Oh, "Dots & Daisies" is doing fabulously! We're just about to start a big new project!

TAG: Daisy_008_f
But enough about me; what was it you wanted to talk about?
