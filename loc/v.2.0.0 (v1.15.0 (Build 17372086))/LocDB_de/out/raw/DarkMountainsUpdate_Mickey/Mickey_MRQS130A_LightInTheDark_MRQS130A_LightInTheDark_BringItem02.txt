{PlayerName}! All my memories about that book... I'm remembering them!

TAG: Mickey_006_f
You and me... When you were just a little kid, we'd read the book together.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
At first, I'd read it to you. And then one day, all of a sudden, you were old enough to read it to me.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Oh, and sometimes, we'd just make up our own stories to go along with the pictures.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
I wish I could remember this...

TAG: Mickey_010_f
It's a pretty special book. Lots of stories about brave heroics and evil villains. And everything comes out right just in time for the "happily ever after."

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe we can read it together again someday.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I wish things were really that simple.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sounds kind of boring. Needs some more action.

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Aw, I'd love that! We haven't read together since... since...

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Hey, now that I think about it, the last time we read this together was right before the Forgetting.

TAG: Mickey_013_f
... But... gosh, that wasn't really you, was it? It was the Forgotten.

TAG: Mickey_014_f
They... they left the book with me. They seemed pretty mad.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
But I think deep down, they were really sad about something.

TAG: Mickey_016_f
Gee, {PlayerName}, I hope you can help the Forgotten out.

TAG: Mickey_017_f
Mickey, the storybook... the magic coming off of it is stronger than ever.

TAG: Mickey_018_f
You've done a lot to help. Now I'll do my part to try to save the Forgotten.

TAG: Mickey_019_f
Welp, I guess if life was always easy, we wouldn't need stories, would we?

TAG: Mickey_020_f
But hey, now that I think about it, that's just what you said to me the last time we read this book together. Right before the Forgetting.

TAG: Mickey_021_f
Oh, don't worry. There's lots of action. There's even one story where a hero pulls a sword out of a stone!
