Gosh, {PlayerName}, things around the Village aren't looking so good.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Those cracks in the sky are pretty scary. Is there anything I can do to help?

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Maybe you can. Does this look familiar?

TAG: Mickey_007_f
A book of fairy tales? You betcha. That's been in my House for just about as long as I can remember.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
We think it once belonged to the Forgotten. Do you know the story behind it?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
It's funny. Now that you show it to me... I'm remembering everything!

TAG: Mickey_016_f
When you were just a little kid, we read this together.

TAG: Mickey_017_f
At first, I'd read it to you. And then one day, all of a sudden, you were old enough to read it to me!

TAG: Mickey_018_f
Oh, and sometimes, we'd just make up our own stories to go along with the pictures.

TAG: Mickey_019_f
I wish I could remember this...

TAG: Mickey_020_f
It's a pretty special book. Lots of stories about brave heroics and evil villains. And everything comes out right just in time for the "happily ever after."

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Maybe we can read it together again someday.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I wish things were really that simple.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Sounds kind of boring. Needs some more action.

TAG: Mickey_021_f
Aw, I'd love that! We haven't read together since... since...

TAG: Mickey_024_f
Hey, now that I think about it, the last time we read this together was right before the Forgetting.

TAG: Mickey_026_f
... But... gosh, that wasn't really you, was it? It was the Forgotten.

TAG: Mickey_027_f
They... they left the book with me. They seemed pretty mad.

TAG: Mickey_028_f
But I think deep down, they were really sad about something.

TAG: Mickey_029_f
Gee, I hope you can help the Forgotten out.

TAG: Mickey_030_f
Mickey, the storybook... the magic coming off of it is stronger than ever.

TAG: Mickey_031_f
You've done a lot to help. Now I'll do my part to try to save the Forgotten.

TAG: Mickey_022_f
Welp, I guess if life was always easy, we wouldn't need stories, would we?

TAG: Mickey_025_f
But hey, now that I think about it, that's just what you said to me the last time we read this book together. Right before the Forgetting.

TAG: Mickey_023_f
Oh, don't worry. There's lots of action. There's even a story where a hero pulls a sword out of a stone!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Hmm... I know there's gotta be some kinda story behind it.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
But after the Forgetting, welp... I just can't remember much.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Huh... ya know what? It's kind of funny. It seems like the more time I spend with you...

TAG: Mickey_011_f
...the more I remember!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So our friendship... it could help restore those lost memories?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is this your way of asking me to hang out more often?

TAG: Mickey_012_f
I think so. I just know that memory's in me somewhere...

TAG: Mickey_015_f
No problem. A little bonding time for {PlayerName} and Mickey should unlock those memories!

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Ha-ha! That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

TAG: Mickey_014_f
I just know that memory's in me somewhere. We just gotta get to it.
