Oh, hiya, pal! Did ya have any luck findin' some nice flowers?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
I found some... uh, nice... flowers. Made a bouquet. Gave it to Minnie.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
You did?! Thanks, pal. But... uh, you didn't have to do all that on your own.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
You coulda just given 'em to me, and I woulda taken care of the rest. Or even better, we coulda made it together!

Oh... right... makes sense...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
(So why didn't you tell me that?!)

TAG: Mickey_006_f

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Well, it's done. So... whatever... I guess...

TAG: Mickey_008_f
That's okay, pal. I'll just go and see how Minnie liked 'em. Thanks again!

TAG: Mickey_009_f
