I found a Night Mite Nest but my Dreamlight Magic doesn't seem to affect it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What do we do now?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are we totally doomed?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let's make a Night Mite Circus!

TAG: Timon_002_f
Yikes, this is more serious than I thought.

TAG: Timon_004_f
We gotta talk to someone who knows about dark stuff like this...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How about the Forgotten?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe one of the Villains?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Like Donald on a bad day?

TAG: Timon_006_f
I've got it!

TAG: Timon_008_f
Let's talk to the Forgotten!

TAG: Timon_010_f
From the conversations we've had, I'm guessing they have experience with dark, creepy-crawly things.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Nah. They don't know anything about bugs... Just about buggin' others.

TAG: Timon_009_f
I was thinkin' we could <Lore>talk to the Forgotten</Lore>?

TAG: Timon_007_f
HA! That guy! He kills me! Those tantrums of his are a riot! But that's more of a short temper.

TAG: Timon_001_f
No, no, no. We're not giving up so easy, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Timon_003_f
What?! Those delectable-looking menaces are agents of the Forgotten! We can't just let 'em run free... or become trapeze artists!
