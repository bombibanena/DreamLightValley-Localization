Me? Okay, I got jokes and I got facts. Which one do you want?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A joke!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A meerkat fact.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A knock-knock joke.

TAG: Timon_001_f
A joke? All right, how's this...

TAG: Timon_004_f
What's the best thing to do if an elephant sneezes?

TAG: Timon_005_f
Get them a big tissue?

TAG: Timon_006_f
More like "get outta the way!"

TAG: Timon_007_f
Ha!

TAG: Timon_008_f
That was a joke AND useful advice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're too funny!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That was all right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Eh, I've heard better.

TAG: Timon_014_f
Hey, you can never be TOO funny.

TAG: Timon_015_f
Just all right? Hey, I know I'm no professional comedian, but I thought that was pretty good!

TAG: Timon_016_f
Oof, tough crowd.

TAG: Timon_002_f
Hmm, let me think...

TAG: Timon_009_f
Okay. Meerkats are real social. We build families that can have as little as three members, but some families have as many as 50!

TAG: Timon_010_f
So Pumbaa, you, and Simba are a family?

TAG: Timon_011_f
Exactly! And when we came to the Village, that family got even bigger!

TAG: Timon_003_f
What's a knock-knock joke?

TAG: Timon_012_f
It's a joke where you pretend to knock on a door.

TAG: Timon_013_f
Great... What's a door?
