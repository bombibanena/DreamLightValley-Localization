Unfortunately, the Fireflies didn't really resonate with Moana. She did say they were pretty, though!

*SIGH* I guess she already looks at LOTS of sparkly sky dots for wayfinding. Maybe that wasn't the advice she needed.

This isn't going so well, is it?

TAG: Timon_002_f
Don't get discouraged!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe we're talking to the wrong people!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We might need to rethink your strategy.

It isn't going great, but we can turn it around!

Hey... you're right! Royals already know how to be royals. We need to make a leader outta someone else!

TAG: Timon_006_f
Let me think... Hmm... Simba had to defeat his uncle... So what we need is a nephew and uncle to compete in something!

TAG: Timon_007_f
Scrooge McDuck and Donald are uncle and nephew!

TAG: Timon_008_f
That's perfect! I heard they had an argument earlier. If we help Donald, maybe he can rise up and become a great leader in the Valley!

TAG: Timon_009_f
All right, I'll go <Lore>talk to Donald</Lore> and see how we can help!

TAG: Timon_004_f
I think you may be right.

TAG: Timon_005_f
I like how you think! And I have an idea...
