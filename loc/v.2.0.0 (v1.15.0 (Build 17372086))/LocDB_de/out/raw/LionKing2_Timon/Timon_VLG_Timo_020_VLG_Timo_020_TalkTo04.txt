I found these pages in the homes of the Villains... they're written very oddly...

TAG: Timon_003_f
And that means...?

TAG: Timon_004_f
All of them are... poetic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It could be a code!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It looks like an incantation!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe we've been wrong this whole time?

TAG: Timon_005_f
Like they're leaving each other secret messages!

TAG: Timon_008_f
{PlayerName}, you're a genius!

TAG: Timon_010_f
Scar's cunning enough to create a secret code like that.

TAG: Timon_012_f
"The Valley's predators seem poised to strike. But at who? And how?"... Narration aside, I bet this is all an elaborate ruse to get the Forgotten on their side. Scar will do anything to rule!

TAG: Timon_013_f
You think he wants to overthrow us?

TAG: Timon_014_f
He did it before. Trust me; he'll do it again.

TAG: Timon_015_f
And hey, while you were investigating, I did a little digging of my own.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What did you find out?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You didn't cause any trouble, did you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Well, that makes sense, since you're a meerkat and all.

TAG: Timon_016_f
Just some rumors...

TAG: Timon_002_f
Apparently, Scar and Mother Gothel have been hanging around the Vitalys Mines looking suspicious.

TAG: Timon_001_f
The only way to know what's going on is to catch 'em in the act! <Lore>Take a picture of them in the Vitalys Mines and show it to the Forgotten</Lore> before it's too late!

TAG: Timon_017_f
Me? Cause trouble? I'm the one tryin' to STOP the trouble!

TAG: Timon_019_f
But I did hear a rumor about a couple of known troublemakers...

TAG: Timon_018_f
Get it? 'Cause you "did a little digging"?

TAG: Timon_020_f
...{PlayerName}, THIS IS SERIOUS!

TAG: Timon_006_f
Maybe they're putting together a magic spell of some kind!

TAG: Timon_009_f
Hmm... that doesn't sound like Scar, but it could be why he teamed up with Ursula and Mother Gothel.

TAG: Timon_007_f
I don't see what these diary pages could possibly mean...

TAG: Timon_011_f
No way; there's definitely something fishy going on... I can smell it.
