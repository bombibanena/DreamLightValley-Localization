Welcome, everyone, to the first ever Timon Talk of the Valley!

TAG: Timon_008_f
I still have questions about that...

TAG: Timon_009_f
And finally, I coached Simba through his most difficult trial yet...

TAG: Timon_015_f
Overcoming his past and defeating his uncle.

TAG: Timon_010_f
And so I invite all of you to follow my lead! Eat new foods, admire the sky, and defeat someone's uncle!

TAG: Timon_011_f
Thank you!

TAG: Timon_012_f
As Simba's right-hand meerkat, I've learned a lot about what it means to be a leader.

TAG: Timon_001_f
That's my best pal!

TAG: Timon_002_f
Ya see, when Pumbaa and I found Simba, we took him in and introduced him to new foods! Grubs!

TAG: Timon_003_f
It's true! We did that!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Pumbaa, please.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Sorry. Go on.

TAG: Timon_006_f
I could see my little cub growing into a fierce lion. We'd lie down and admire the fireflies in the sky.
