The Valley is all about friends and family, Timon. I just hope you feel comfortable here now.

Well, thanks to you, I'm startin' to!

By the way, you can keep the game. In case you want another round some time. Thanks for helping me relax, kid!

And afternoon naps. Don't forget about those.

I think I'll just keep my distance... a long distance.
