So... uh, {PlayerName}... thanks for cleaning up my mess. I might've been a tiny bit paranoid when I saw Scar roaming around.

TAG: Timon_001_f
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I just hope you're feeling better!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't blame you for being a little worried.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe you should apologize to Scar.

TAG: Timon_002_f
I am. Thanks, {PlayerName}. Simba backed you up and explained that Scar knows he has to stick to the rules here.

TAG: Timon_008_f
I mean, I don't LOVE that Scar could be lurking around every corner, stomach rumbling with hunger...

TAG: Timon_009_f
...but I'll get used to it.

TAG: Timon_010_f
The point is that the Valley is a safe place for everyone, Timon.

TAG: Timon_011_f
And that includes the Villains. As long as they don't step out of line, they are free to live here happily and safely.

TAG: Timon_012_f
Gotcha. I'll... uh... I'll try to remember that.

TAG: Timon_013_f
Hmm, you know what? I might know a way to help you relax. But it's a surprise!

TAG: Timon_015_f
I'll go <Lore>talk to Pumbaa</Lore> and see what he thinks. If he likes it, we'll get it all set up for you!

TAG: Timon_003_f
Scar isn't exactly... approachable.

TAG: Timon_005_f
HA! Ain't that the understatement of the year.

TAG: Timon_006_f
At least you get it!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Look, I feel bad, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

TAG: Timon_007_f
I've heard Scar describe Pumbaa as "succulent."
