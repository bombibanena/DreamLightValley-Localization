No, no, no! We gotta put a stop to that!

TAG: Timon_001_f
Wait â what are you worried about?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The future.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Just kind of worried in general.

TAG: Timon_002_f
Okay. Here's what you do.

TAG: Timon_003_f
You get a bunch of bugs. Or whatever you like to eat.

TAG: Timon_004_f
You go to an oasis. Or maybe get a gourd of water? Either works.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Then, you hang out with a friend.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Hanging with a friend sounds nice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
When I'm worried, I like to be alone.

TAG: Timon_006_f
So then you invite that friend to the oasis too!

TAG: Timon_007_f
You eat the bugs, drink the water, and you just relax.

TAG: Timon_008_f
Trust me, it works like a charm.

TAG: Timon_009_f
So you go be by yourself! Curl up by the oasis, maybe under a cozy leaf.

TAG: Timon_010_f
You eat the bugs, drink the water, and you just relax.

TAG: Timon_011_f
Go easy on yourself, okay, kid?
