{PlayerName}! Have you seen Pumbaa?!

TAG: Player_000_f
Pumbaa's missing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We have to find him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's probably looking for grubs to eat.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
When did you last see him?

TAG: Timon_002_f
Of course we have to find him! This is a disaster!

TAG: Timon_004_f
What do we do?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Take a deep breath.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Timon, I've never seen you like this.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Where's your "hakuna matata" attitude?

TAG: Timon_006_f
*inhale* *exhale* *inhale* *exhale* Okay... You're right.

TAG: Timon_005_f
It's just, I've never lost Pumbaa before! I looked all over for him.

TAG: Timon_008_f
Maybe you missed something? I'll <Lore>search for Pumbaa</Lore>.

TAG: Timon_007_f
There are times for hakuna matata, and there are times to panic.

TAG: Timon_003_f
Guess which time this is?

TAG: Timon_009_f
Time to panic?

TAG: Timon_010_f
YES! What if he got eaten by a predator?!

TAG: Timon_011_f
Try to relax, Timon.

TAG: Timon_001_f
Well, he LEFT to look for grubs, but that was way TOO LONG ago!
