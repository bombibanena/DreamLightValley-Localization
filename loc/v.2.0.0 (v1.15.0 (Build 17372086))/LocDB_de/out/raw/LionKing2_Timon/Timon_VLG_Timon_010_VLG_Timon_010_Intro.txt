Hey kid, how 'bout giving me a hand? I gotta get this place spruced up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'm busy right now!

TAG: Timon_002_f
Glad you asked! I wanna give Pride Rock what you might call a jungle makeover. Things feel so... exposed around here.

TAG: Timon_003_f
I have some great stuff to work with here. Some strong fences, lush greenery we can lounge under... or hide behind...

TAG: Timon_001_f
Are you doing okay, Timon? Seems like you might be scared of something.

TAG: Timon_008_f
Me scared? No! Of course not! No way! I uh... I just need a little more jungle around me to feel at home. I'm FINE.

TAG: Timon_005_f
Okay, if you're sure... You may not live in the jungle anymore, but I can bring the jungle to you.

TAG: Timon_009_f
Excellent! I knew you'd understand.

TAG: Timon_006_f
I'll <Lore>use your jungle-y items to decorate around Pride Rock</Lore>! It will feel more like home in no time.

TAG: Timon_007_f
Thanks! I gotta go find Pumbaa. He's gonna be thrilled to hear you're helpin' out!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Not a problem. Come and see me later. Just don't take too long.
