Oh, so this must be that ice cream Pumbaa told me you were making. Sorry to spoil the surprise â we have no secrets.

Say, this looks so good I'm not even THINKING about a vicious lion tryin' to eat me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Trust me; it's delicious!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Anything for you, Timon!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I bet Pumbaa will love it.

TAG: Timon_006_f
I'm gonna wait to try it with Pumbaa.

TAG: Timon_002_f
I'm just hoping it will help you really get back to your Hakuna Matata roots.

TAG: Timon_003_f
Ya know, I think it might.

This Board Game looks interesting too. While I go find Pumbaa, can you <Lore>put the Board Game somewhere</Lore> so we can try it out?

TAG: Timon_010_f
Sure thing!

TAG: Timon_004_f
Thanks, pal!

TAG: Timon_005_f
Yeah, I'm gonna wait and try this with him.
