Hey, {PlayerName}, did that fancy rock you pointed at Pumbaa show ya anything that'll help?

TAG: Player_000_f
You mean my phone?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, Pumbaa's REALLY stuck in there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I didn't notice anything, but it was pretty funny.

TAG: Timon_002_f
We're gonna need something slippery to apply that might help us pull him out.

TAG: Timon_004_f
How did you get Pumbaa free from the last log he was stuck in?

TAG: Timon_005_f
Let me think... Oh yeah! I mashed up some of the greasiest bugs I could find into a special oil, and that got him loose.

TAG: Timon_006_f
Could we do that again?

TAG: Timon_007_f
I don't see why not. It was pretty complicated, though... I made <Lore>two bug oils</Lore> and then <Lore>combined THOSE oils</Lore> to make a <ActivityItem>Super Slippery Bug Oil</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Timon_008_f
Okay... I'll start collecting the different types of bugs we need. How do I find them?

TAG: Timon_009_f
It'll be easy for you with that choppy thing of yours. Just <Lore>break rocks around the jungle</Lore> and <Lore>get the bugs under 'em</Lore>.

TAG: Timon_003_f
Funny but serious, right? We gotta get Pumbaa outta that log!
