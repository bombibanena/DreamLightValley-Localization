Now that's a story! It was completely my idea.

TAG: Timon_001_f
See, Pumbaa and I met Simba when he was a kid. Just a cub.

TAG: Timon_002_f
And at first Pumbaa was real nervous about being pals.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you sure it was your idea?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Was he?

TAG: Timon_003_f
Of course it was. This is my story!

TAG: Timon_004_f
But I convinced Pumbaa being friends with Simba was a good idea! I said, "What if he's on our side?!"

TAG: Timon_005_f
"Havin' a lion around might not be such a bad idea."

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
And now you're friends!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's really sweet.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Are you SURE it was your idea?

TAG: Timon_006_f
The best of pals!

TAG: Timon_007_f
Yeah. I love the big lug.

TAG: Timon_008_f
I'm friends with a lion! Who'd have ever thought?

TAG: Timon_009_f
Look. Do I criticize and question your cherished memories of friendship?

TAG: Timon_010_f
No, I do not. Sit down and eat a grub.

TAG: Timon_011_f
You bet! He was all, "That's a lion! Lions eat guys like us!"
