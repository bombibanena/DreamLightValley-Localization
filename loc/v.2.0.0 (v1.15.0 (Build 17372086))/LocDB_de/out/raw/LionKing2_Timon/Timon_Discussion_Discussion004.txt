Well, I love Simba. He's like a brother to me. A really big hairy brother.

But Nala still makes me kinda nervous. You know she tried to eat Pumbaa when she first met him?

Only once.

Nala would never hurt you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She was just acting on instinct!

TAG: Timon_002_f
Sure. But you know how many times it takes to get eaten by a lion? ONCE! ... On the other hand, she IS a main line of defense between us and all the other dangerous stuff out there... Forget what I said. Nala's great!

I know. I know. You're right. Sometimes, it's just hard to shake that first impression. But I promise, I'm workin' on it!

TAG: Timon_004_f
That's one dangerous instinct for little guys like us! ... Huh... I think I just had to talk it out. Nala wouldn't hurt us... Hey, thanks, {PlayerName}.
