Okay, {PlayerName}, to start your hakuna matata lessons, you gotta put your past behind ya!

TAG: Timon_001_f
And *I* came up with the perfect way to do that.

TAG: Timon_002_f
Kind of a symbolic gesture, if you will... It's time for you to get rid of something that represents your past!

TAG: Timon_003_f
So, let's talk about you... You strike me as the leader type.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm definitely in charge!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I wish I was a leader.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I just like to help. I don't care who's in charge.

TAG: Timon_004_f
I knew it! Okay, we can work with this...

TAG: Timon_005_f
Can ya think of anything that represents leadership?

TAG: Timon_006_f
You mean an object? Well, maybe... a crown?

TAG: Timon_007_f
Great!

TAG: Timon_008_f
What's a crown?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A symbol of royalty, like a mane but made of metal.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
A shiny circle made of metal and jewels.

TAG: Timon_009_f
Metal? Oh, like those tools you use! Hmm... a shiny metal mane? I... Hey!

TAG: Timon_010_f
I think I saw one of those <Lore>in the water around here</Lore>, but I can't remember where.

TAG: Timon_011_f
You saw a crown in the water? I better <Lore>find it and fish it out</Lore>.

TAG: Timon_012_f
You're also gonna need something to shout your worries into.

TAG: Timon_013_f
I could make a bottle or an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem>... but I need <ActivityItem>Sand</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Coal</ActivityItem> to make glass. Coal is a black rock that makes fire.

TAG: Timon_014_f
You're in luck, 'cause there's <Lore>some sand in the jungle</Lore>. And if this dusty rock is the "coal" you mentioned, it's all yours. Pumbaa and I tried to use it to grind up some bugs, but it turned our delicious bug mash all gritty.

TAG: Timon_015_f
Hm... I'll definitely <Lore>collect everything I need and head to our Crafting Station in the jungle</Lore>!

TAG: Timon_016_f
Metal? Oh, like those tools you use! Hmm... Metal circle... Metal circle... Hey!

TAG: Timon_017_f
Listen, everyone CAN be a leader! Let's go with that.

TAG: Timon_018_f
And that's just what a good leader would say!
