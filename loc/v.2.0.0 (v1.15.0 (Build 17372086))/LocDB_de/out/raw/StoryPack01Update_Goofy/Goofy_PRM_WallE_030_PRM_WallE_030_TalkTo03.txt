No way.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sure the others will get your mood up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hmm, I see your point.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Goofy! How are you doing today?

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Well, I was tryin' to work on my scrapbook, but I couldn't think of what I wanted to take pictures of.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Oh no! Not feeling too inspired today?

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Gawrsh, I guess not.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
I know just the thing!

TAG: Goofy_006_f
WALLÂ·E is planning a little shindig â you should come!

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Gee, I don't know, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
What if my lack of inspiration brings the party down?

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Still, I understand why you're concerned.

TAG: Goofy_019_f
Just wait until I'm back with the pics!

TAG: Goofy_020_f
Wahoo! I sure am lookin' forward to it!

TAG: Goofy_011_f
What if I help you get your creativity back?

TAG: Goofy_012_f
And then you can get back to spreading your fun Goofy vibes!

TAG: Goofy_013_f
Oh boy, you'd do that for me?

TAG: Goofy_014_f
Sure!

TAG: Goofy_015_f
I'll take a bunch of pictures around the Village.

TAG: Goofy_016_f
Maybe some <Lore>Villagers</Lore>, <Lore>Houses</Lore>...

TAG: Goofy_017_f
Oh, and <Lore>Animal Companions</Lore>! And <Lore>Fruit Trees</Lore>!

TAG: Goofy_018_f
Wow, I'm feelin' inspired already!

TAG: Goofy_010_f
But I get why you're hesitant.
