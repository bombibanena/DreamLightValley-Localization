Howdy, {PlayerName}! How ya doing today?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I need your help...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Trying to help WALLÂ·E, but it's not going great...

TAG: Goofy_001_f
You're great? Gawrsh, me too!

TAG: Goofy_010_f
In the Meadow? How'd it get there?!

TAG: Goofy_011_f
No idea. It's a real head-scratcher.

TAG: Goofy_012_f
I picked up a piece on the Beach and was trying to bring it to Uncle Scrooge...

TAG: Goofy_013_f
But I put it down for just a second to rest my arms...

TAG: Goofy_014_f
And then I musta slipped on some mud and fell over!

TAG: Goofy_015_f
Next thing I knew, the big metal chunk was gone!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
... You pushed it into the pond by accident, didn't you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Could be someone played a prank on you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I honestly have no idea.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Bet you had pancakes and pickles for breakfast like I did, huh?

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Umm... something like that.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something...

TAG: Goofy_005_f
You betcha, pal! What's up?

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Well, WALLÂ·E really wants to find a trash can lid. I don't know exactly why, but he really wants it! I haven't seen any in the Valley, though.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Hmm... I haven't seen any trash can lids around here. But maybe you could make one from scratch.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Last time I was in the Meadow fishin', my line kept getting stuck.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
I betcha it's a buncha that <ActivityItem>Scrap Metal</ActivityItem> I keep findin' around here.

TAG: Goofy_016_f
I hadn't thought of that, but you're prob'ly right!

TAG: Goofy_017_f
All right Goofy, I should be able to handle this â the Royal Fishing Rod will have a better chance of pulling the metal out than yours.

TAG: Goofy_018_f
That's true. And I hope you can find the other pieces out there too â I saw a bunch on the Beach!

TAG: Goofy_019_f
Some were just layin' around, some were buried in the sand, and some were in the water.

TAG: Goofy_020_f
Perfect â we'll look into those! Were those the only ones you saw?

TAG: Goofy_021_f
Nope. I saw Ursula grab some. I offered to recycle 'em for her, but she said she had plans for 'em.

TAG: Goofy_022_f
And then she did one of those scary villain laughs.

TAG: Goofy_023_f
Oof, okay, I'll look into that â thanks, Goofy!

TAG: Goofy_024_f
Not sure what kind of prank that'd be... but I suppose it could be funny.

TAG: Goofy_025_f
Wow, if YOU can't figure it out, it really is a mystery!

TAG: Goofy_026_f
Uh-oh! Hope I can help!

TAG: Goofy_027_f
Uh-oh! What's wrong, pal?
