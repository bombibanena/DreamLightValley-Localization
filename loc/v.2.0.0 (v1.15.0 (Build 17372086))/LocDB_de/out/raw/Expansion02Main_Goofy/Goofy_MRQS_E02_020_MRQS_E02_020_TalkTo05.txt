Gawrsh, {PlayerName}, what is this place? It sure is pretty.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's called the Storybook Vale.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maleficent and Hades' playground...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Another big mess for me to sort out.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Ya know, I think I'm startin' to remember it! The place with all the books!

TAG: Goofy_002_f
I hope at least a couple of 'em are about fishin'. A-hyuk.

Uncle Scrooge said I oughta "use this place as an opportunity to expand my business."

TAG: Goofy_007_f
But I don't know what I'd even sell here in my Stall.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
I guess I should start by findin' out what kinds of <ActivityItem>Fish</ActivityItem> swim in the waters around here.

TAG: Goofy_011_f
Then I can figure out what kinds of spices and vegetables would go with 'em!

TAG: Goofy_008_f
You seem to know your way around pretty well. Think you could help me <Lore>catch some of the fish</Lore> here?

TAG: Goofy_009_f
I'll try catchin' some too, but... well, you know my luck with fishin' rods!

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Yikes! Maleficent and Hades. I was wonderin' where those two went.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
If you see 'em around, let me know so I can go the other way.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Gee, I thought you had enough of those back in the Valley!
