How can Stitch help {PlayerName}?

TAG: Stitch_002_f
I know about the glitter prank you and Vanellope pulled at Daisy's gala.

TAG: Stitch_003_f
Ooga-tabah!

TAG: Player_000_f
No, don't worry! I just want in...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
SO funny. Nice work!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The next one could be BETTER!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll show you amateurs how it's done.

TAG: Stitch_005_f
Oojooba!

TAG: Player_001_f
Can you and Vanellope meet me at the Cursed Cave?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Because it makes absolute sense. Doesn't it? Say it does... Please.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's the coolest hideout.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We'll plan the biggest prank ever.

TAG: Stitch_000_f
Is {PlayerName} okay?

TAG: Stitch_004_f
YES!

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Why wouldn't I be? It would be suspicious if I wasn't okay. And I'm not suspicious. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

TAG: Stitch_010_f
... Okitaka. Stitch and Vanellope will meet {PlayerName} in the Cursed Cave.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Great... Phew...

TAG: Stitch_009_f
Okitaka!

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Stitch excited!

TAG: Stitch_007_f
{PlayerName} wants to prank with us?
