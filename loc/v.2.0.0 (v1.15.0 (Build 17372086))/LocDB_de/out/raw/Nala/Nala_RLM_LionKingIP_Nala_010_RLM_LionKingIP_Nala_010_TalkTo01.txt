Grrr...

TAG: Nala_001_f
Hi! I'm {PlayerName}. And you must be...

TAG: Nala_002_f
*ROAR!*

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
ACK! Please don't eat me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uh... nice kitty! Stay back!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Grr! Roar!

TAG: Nala_003_f
Trust me. I probably wouldn't taste very good!

TAG: Nala_044_f
They've been tracking me ever since my mate Simba and I set out from the Pride Lands.

TAG: Nala_019_f
Hmm. Maybe I could help you get rid of them.

TAG: Nala_020_f
Well, you can either do that or keep out of my way. It's up to you.

TAG: Nala_021_f
My name's Nala, by the way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What are you doing out here?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Tell me more about the hyenas.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What can I do to help?

TAG: Nala_015_f
Grrr... You don't seem threatening...

TAG: Nala_011_f
You can talk!

TAG: Nala_013_f
Of course.

TAG: Nala_014_f
And you can understand me!

TAG: Nala_012_f
Heh. I guess that means you're really not going to eat me?

TAG: Nala_007_f
I was just trying to scare you off. I thought you were another hyena.

TAG: Nala_017_f
There are hyenas around here?

TAG: Nala_018_f
You see those eyes glowing in the darkness all around us? There's a whole pack of them.

TAG: Nala_025_f
Trying to get a little rest. Simba's king of the Pride Lands, and we needed a bit of a break from all the royal... stuff.

TAG: Nala_024_f
He wanted to show me more of the jungle where he grew up with his friends, Timon and Pumbaa.

TAG: Nala_026_f
We got separated not long ago, and I'm supposed to meet him in this jungle.

TAG: Nala_027_f
But I don't want to lead a pack of angry hyenas right to him.

TAG: Nala_028_f
The hyenas have been mad at us ever since we forced them away from Pride Rock.

TAG: Nala_029_f
Their numbers are dwindling. There aren't as many as there were back when their leader Scar was here.

TAG: Nala_030_f
But there are still enough of them to cause a lot of trouble.

TAG: Nala_023_f
We need to throw them off our trail.

TAG: Nala_032_f
I can hold the hyenas off for a bit. But there are a lot of them.

TAG: Nala_043_f
I don't know what that is, but you can explain it later.

TAG: Nala_040_f
I'll hold off the hyenas as long as I can. I just hope you know what you're doing.

TAG: Nala_033_f
If there were some way to block the path so they can't follow us, that would help.

TAG: Nala_034_f
There are a lot of thorn bushes around here. I'll bet the hyenas wouldn't want to get tangled in those.

TAG: Nala_035_f
They wouldn't. But how would we get them to the middle of the path?

TAG: Nala_036_f
Aha. I bet my trusty Watering Can might be able to help us.

TAG: Nala_038_f
You sure that's going to work?

TAG: Nala_039_f
You're just going to have to trust me on this one.

TAG: Nala_037_f
If you can hold off those hyenas, I'll <Lore>plant some seeds for the thorns and water them until they grow.</Lore>

TAG: Nala_041_f
Don't worry. It shouldn't take long. It's magic.

TAG: Nala_031_f
Before we go any farther, we need to throw those hyenas off our trail.

TAG: Nala_022_f
I'm supposed to meet Simba somewhere in that jungle. But I can't lead the hyenas right to him.

TAG: Nala_004_f
I promise I'll find you some very large catnip and a scratching post if you just keep your distance!

TAG: Nala_016_f
What are you talking about...? Never mind. I'll keep my distance if you keep yours.

TAG: Nala_005_f
You think you're the only one who can roar around here?

TAG: Nala_006_f
Grrr! Roar! Be afraid! Be very afraid!

TAG: Nala_008_f
Was that supposed to scare me?

TAG: Nala_009_f
You sound like Simba when he was a cub.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Hey! I thought I sounded prettyâ
