I remember this now. I know why the statues look like me.

After you and Merlin created those <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem>, they needed to stay with me.

TAG: Nala_005_f
I had to watch over them as if they were my cubs. Something about being near me made them start to glow.

TAG: Nala_006_f
Wait. That's it. I think that's the fourth ingredient!

TAG: Nala_007_f
They needed the heart of a lioness.

Your bravery, your love for your pride... that's what powers the enchantment.

TAG: Nala_008_f
So it's not my fault that all this happened...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Of course not.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
It was never your fault.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Of course not. You're the only one who can fix this, Nala.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Well, that's a relief.

TAG: Nala_009_f
I'll let you know when the <ActivityItem>Enchanted Hearts</ActivityItem> start glowing.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Maybe then we can finally fix all of this. Once and for all.
