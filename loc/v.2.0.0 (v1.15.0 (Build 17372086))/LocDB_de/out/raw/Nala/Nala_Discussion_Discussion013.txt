{PlayerName}, can I ask about those coverings on your feet? Everyone seems to have different ones. What are they for?

TAG: Player_000_f
You mean shoes?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I wear them because my feet are soft, and I need to protect them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They help me walk on different surfaces.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They look cool!

TAG: Nala_001_f
Oh. I guess some animals need things like that if they don't have pads on their paws.

TAG: Nala_002_f
That makes sense. After all, you do go everywhere.

TAG: Nala_004_f
The Sunlit Plateau, the Frosted Heights... That's a lot of walking.

TAG: Nala_003_f
I suppose they do look interesting.
