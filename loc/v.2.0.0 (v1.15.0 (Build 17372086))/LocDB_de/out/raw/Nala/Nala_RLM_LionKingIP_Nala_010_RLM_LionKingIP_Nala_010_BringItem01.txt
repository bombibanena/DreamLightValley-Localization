So these are the grubs that Simba loves so much?

TAG: Nala_005_f
I have to admit... they do look kind of tasty.

TAG: Nala_006_f
I must be really hungry. Well, here goes...

TAG: Nala_007_f
Hm. The taste is...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is it like chicken?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eh, you'll learn to love it.

TAG: Nala_008_f
I'm not sure, but I can see how Simba started to like it after a while.

TAG: Nala_013_f
It's definitely hyenas, but this time it's not just a pack.

TAG: Nala_014_f
It's as many as a herd. I counted hundreds of them.

TAG: Nala_015_f
Simba and I can handle ourselves against some of them. But their numbers... there are just too many. We're completely surrounded.

TAG: Nala_016_f
If only we had a herd of lions to fight them off.

TAG: Nala_017_f
Nala! That's it!

TAG: Nala_018_f
We may not have a herd, but we could trick them into thinking we do.

TAG: Nala_019_f
How would we do that?

TAG: Nala_020_f
We just need to make it SOUND like we have a hundred lions in this jungle...

TAG: Nala_021_f
I'm going to <Lore>sneak back to my Village and try to find something</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_001_f
They're sort of... crackly and squishy at the same time.

TAG: Nala_022_f
I'll <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>. I'll bet he has something that would help.

TAG: Nala_023_f
All right. Simba and I will try to hold back the hyenas.

TAG: Nala_024_f
But please hurry.

TAG: Nala_009_f
Hey... did you hear that?

TAG: Nala_010_f
Hear what?

TAG: Nala_011_f
Shh! Stay quiet and listen.

TAG: Nala_012_f
I think it's more hyenas. I'm going to check.
