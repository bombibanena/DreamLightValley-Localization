This looks great.

TAG: Nala_004_f
But I think anything would look good to me right now. I'm so hungry I could eat a whole water buffalo.

TAG: Nala_005_f
May I?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Enjoy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Bon appetit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry, it's not as big as a water buffalo.

TAG: Nala_006_f
Here goes...

TAG: Nala_008_f
Well, one thing's for sure.

TAG: Nala_009_f
That was much better than grubs.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Now that you've helped me with the hunting grounds, I'll do what I can to keep finding food and watch out for danger.

TAG: Nala_012_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. You're a really good friend.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Aw, thanks. So are you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I just do my best and hope it works out.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I know. I'd make a great lion. Roar!

TAG: Nala_014_f
That means a lot.

TAG: Nala_017_f
With both of us looking out for this Valley, I think everything's going to be just fine.

TAG: Nala_015_f
I do the same. And I don't always know what I'm doing either.

TAG: Nala_018_f
But I think as long as we work together, everything will be just fine.

TAG: Nala_013_f
Hm. Maybe. But you'll have to work on that roar.

TAG: Nala_016_f
And maybe grow out your whiskers.

TAG: Nala_007_f
That's all right. I'm sure it'll be delicious.
