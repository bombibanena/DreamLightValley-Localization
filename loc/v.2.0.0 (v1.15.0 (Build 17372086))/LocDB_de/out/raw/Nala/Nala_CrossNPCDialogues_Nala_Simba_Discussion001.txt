Nala! Am I glad to see you!

TAG: Nala_004_f
Me too. I've missed you. And I could've used some help fending off those hyenas.

TAG: Nala_005_f
Well, it looks like you handled it just fine on your own. Are you okay?

TAG: Nala_008_f
Yes. But fighting off a pack of hyenas does make you work up quite an appetite...

TAG: Nala_009_f
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Not a lot of zebras around here. But don't worry. I think I know just the thing...

TAG: Nala_002_f
Though, I might need some help from {PlayerName} to put it together.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Wait... Simba, you better not be talking aboutâ

TAG: Nala_012_f
Trust me. I promise you'll find them slimy yet satisfying.
