So, I found what you were talking about. It's a statue. The weird thing is that the second I picked it up, I saw something shining in the water.

TAG: Nala_000_f
It looked like some kind of <Lore>mystical rift</Lore>. Here. I took a picture of it to give you a closer look.

TAG: Nala_001_f
That's so strange. Every time I look towards Dazzle Beach, my whiskers start twitching.

TAG: Nala_007_f
Ugh, and that smell! I know my nose is more sensitive than yours, but it's worse than a whole pack of hyenas.

TAG: Nala_009_f
The statue, the rift, the smell... they must be connected somehow.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I know we can fix this.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I hope we can fix this.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
How do we fix this?!

TAG: Nala_010_f
Maybe if we just bury the statue again...

TAG: Nala_019_f
I'll patrol and make sure nothing dangerous comes through that rift.

TAG: Nala_012_f
I don't think that's going to help.

TAG: Nala_013_f
The smell isn't just coming from Dazzle Beach anymore. Now I smell it coming from other places in the Valley.

TAG: Nala_014_f
Uh-oh. Where?

TAG: Nala_015_f
The Frosted Heights and the Glade of Trust.

TAG: Nala_016_f
If I even look in those directions, my whiskers start twitching.

TAG: Nala_017_f
I'll go <Lore>investigate the Frosted Heights and the Glade of Trust</Lore> to see if any more mystical rifts have opened up.

TAG: Nala_020_f
Maybe there are more of these statues lying around...

TAG: Nala_018_f
Please hurry. The smell is getting worse.

TAG: Nala_011_f
I'm not sure. I've never encountered anything like this before.
