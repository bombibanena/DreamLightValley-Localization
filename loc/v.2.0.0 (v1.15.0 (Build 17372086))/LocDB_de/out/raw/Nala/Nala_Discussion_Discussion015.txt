Hi, {PlayerName}! Simba and I are about to take a trip around the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Nala_001_f
It'll be nice to spend some time together, just the two of us.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds like fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds like a date.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Will you visit the Elephant Graveyard?

TAG: Nala_002_f
I'm sure it will be. We always have a wonderful time together.

TAG: Nala_003_f
Oh, Minnie told me about those. I think you're right.

TAG: Nala_004_f
Maybe Simba will bring you flowers or chocolates.

TAG: Nala_005_f
Flowers? Chocolate? Why would he do that?

TAG: Nala_006_f
Uh... never mind, forget about it. It's a human thing.

TAG: Nala_007_f
Why not?

TAG: Nala_008_f
We're grown lions. Hyenas aren't a threat to us anymore.

TAG: Nala_009_f
And I'd love to explore every part of the Valley.
