{PlayerName}, I was wondering, why do you like to walk on two legs?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's just how I am.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can reach things.

Why do you walk on four?

TAG: Nala_001_f
I see. Like Timon. And Remy. Though he says it's because he doesn't like to get his front paws dirty.

TAG: Nala_002_f
That makes sense. If I rear up on my back legs, I can catch or bat at things. You're just doing that all the time.

Oh, I can't balance for very long on just my back legs. Plus, staying low to the ground is useful when I'm hunting.
