{PlayerName}, I found something strange on one of my patrols.

TAG: Nala_007_f
I've been trying to figure it out, but I think I need your help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure. What did you find?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Nala_008_f
I was patrolling near Skull Rock off Dazzle Beach when I smelled something odd...

TAG: Nala_010_f
My whiskers even started twitching...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Strange smell?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Whiskers twitching?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What happened next?

TAG: Nala_011_f
It reminded me of when Simba and I were young, and we explored the Elephant Graveyard.

TAG: Nala_012_f
It was... musty. Like something just starting to rot.

TAG: Nala_015_f
I got closer to investigate and found something buried in the ground. The tide had washed away the sand on top of it.

TAG: Nala_016_f
So I dug it out. It was a small, brown thing that looked like... me.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Like some sort of mystical idol...?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Like a decoration?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Like... a Nala action figure?

TAG: Nala_017_f
I'm not sure what you mean. Rafiki used to make pictures of animals, but this didn't look like anything I've seen before.

TAG: Nala_022_f
When I was digging it out, I scratched it with my claw.

TAG: Nala_023_f
Sparks came out of it. Like it was going to catch fire. And my whiskers started twitching even more.

TAG: Nala_024_f
That's when I decided to come find you.

TAG: Player_003_f
Sounds like another magical mystery.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Don't worry. You've come to the right person.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I'm no expert, but I'll do my best to help you.

TAG: Player_003_choice_003_f
Uh, maybe you should ask Merlin instead.

TAG: Nala_025_f
I thought so. You've solved so many problems like this for your pride already.

TAG: Nala_028_f
Okay. I'll go <Lore>find this strange thing on Skull Rock near Dazzle Beach.</Lore>

TAG: Nala_026_f
I know you will. Trust in yourself. You've solved so many problems like this for your pride already.

TAG: Nala_027_f
I don't want to bother Merlin until I know for sure what we're dealing with.

TAG: Nala_018_f
You mean the colorful things around the dwellings here? No. I think it was more than that.

TAG: Nala_019_f
What's that?

TAG: Nala_020_f
It's like a toy we humans play with. They come with lots of features and moveable parts...

TAG: Nala_021_f
Oh. No, I don't think that's what this was.

TAG: Nala_013_f
It was almost like there was a whole stampede of wildebeests nearby.

TAG: Nala_014_f
But there wasn't anything. It was just peaceful.

TAG: Nala_009_f
Of course. Maybe I'll ask Merlin. This seems like it's more his territory than mine.
