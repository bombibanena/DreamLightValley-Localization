Someday, Simba and I are going to have a cub. I've been thinking about what names we could use.

What do you think of "Kiara"?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I like Kiara.

How about Nala Jr.?

TAG: Nala_001_f
I do too. It's bright and hopeful. I look forward to teaching my cub what my mother taught me.

Two Nalas might get a little confusing.
