Ugh. What is that? And why is it glowing?

TAG: Player_000_f
It's some kind of fish that swam out of the rift.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I hope it's not dangerous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It might be the key to solving this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll bet it doesn't taste very good.

TAG: Nala_000_f
I've never seen anything like it. Or SMELLED anything like it.

TAG: Nala_006_f
All of this... the rifts, the glowing fish, the strange statues...

TAG: Nala_007_f
It's not like anything I've ever had to deal with before.

TAG: Nala_008_f
I know one person who might have some idea what's going on.

TAG: Nala_009_f
We're dealing with strange sea creatures and Dark Magic. This is a job for Ursula.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Ursula seems to only care about what's best for Ursula. Do you really think she'll help us?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
She's really not so bad. We're friends.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
She'll help. The whole Valley might be in danger.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm the boss around here. I'll MAKE her help.

TAG: Nala_011_f
You are? Of course, you do seem to get along with everyone here.

TAG: Nala_005_f
You even manage to get along with Scar...

TAG: Nala_014_f
Well, I suppose you should lead the way. Let's <Lore>go talk to Ursula</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_012_f
That's true. It is in her best interest to help us.

TAG: Nala_003_f
Even Scar wouldn't want the whole Valley to get pulled into one of those rifts.

TAG: Nala_013_f
You really are a leader, {PlayerName}. You seem to know how to keep even the worst creatures around here in line.

TAG: Nala_015_f
Not even Scar wants to mess with you.

TAG: Nala_001_f
I hope so.

TAG: Nala_002_f
Don't eat it! We don't know where it comes from.
