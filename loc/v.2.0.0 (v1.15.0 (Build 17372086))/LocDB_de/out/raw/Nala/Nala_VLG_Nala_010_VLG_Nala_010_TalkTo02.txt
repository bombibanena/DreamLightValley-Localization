Wow, {PlayerName}. You caught so many fish.

I guess we have a lot to learn from each other.

TAG: Nala_000_f
But maybe we should eat first. I'm starving.

TAG: Nala_007_f
Hey, that's another thing I could teach you.

TAG: Nala_008_f
The art of fine cuisine.

TAG: Player_000_f
Usually we humans would prepare fish before eating it. We could...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...wrap them in rice and seaweed to make sushi.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...grill them with some nice vegetables.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...stick them between bread to make a sandwich.

TAG: Nala_009_f
You're the expert. But whatever we do, could we do it fast?

TAG: Nala_010_f
My stomach's grumbling.

TAG: Nala_011_f
Don't worry. Maybe you can relax near that resting spot I made for you while I <Lore>make you some food</Lore>.
