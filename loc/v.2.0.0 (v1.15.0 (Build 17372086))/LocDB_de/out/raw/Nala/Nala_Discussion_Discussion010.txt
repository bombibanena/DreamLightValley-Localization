{PlayerName}, I've seen a lot of strange rectangles in the Village.

TAG: Nala_001_f
Merlin tells me they're called doors. What are they for?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They make our shelters better.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're for privacy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
They're useless. We should outlaw doors!

TAG: Nala_002_f
They keep the cold wind and hot sun out. But you can still get inside.

TAG: Nala_005_f
Oh, I understand. Thank you for explaining it to me.

TAG: Nala_003_f
Oh, I understand. So you don't have to leave when you want to hear yourself think. A den full of lions can get pretty noisy sometimes.

TAG: Nala_006_f
But you can just close the door.

TAG: Nala_004_f
But they must have some use. They're everywhere in the Village.

Maybe I'll try asking Merlin again...
