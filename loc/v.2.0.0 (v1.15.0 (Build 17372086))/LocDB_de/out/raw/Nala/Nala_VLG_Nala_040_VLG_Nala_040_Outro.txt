What is this? It smells amazing.

This is made with the fish from the Here and There, Nala. Remy gave me a recipe. We thought you should have it first.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
To celebrate Nala, the protector of Dreamlight Valley.

I know you must be hungry after all that work we did.

You've got a lion's stomach, in case it turns out poisonous.

TAG: Nala_005_f
I really don't know what to say.

TAG: Nala_018_f
... Thank you, {PlayerName}. I can't tell you how much that means to me.

TAG: Nala_019_f
And to show you how much I appreciate your help, I asked Scrooge McDuck to make a special place for you.

TAG: Nala_020_f
It's an oasis for the Valley. Something everyone can use.

TAG: Nala_008_f
I'm glad I could help you feed your pride, {PlayerName}, and keep the Valley safe.

TAG: Nala_011_f
You're part of my pride, Nala. So it's time to dig in and eat!

TAG: Nala_012_f
Let's try it. It smells so good.

TAG: Nala_013_f
That was delicious.

TAG: Nala_014_f
I was so worried that because of me, this whole Valley was going to be destroyed, or that everyone would go hungry.

TAG: Nala_015_f
But now it's safe, and we have more food than ever.

TAG: Nala_016_f
You're just what this Village needed, Nala.

TAG: Nala_006_f
I'm starving. I can't wait to try this.

TAG: Nala_007_f
Excuse me. What?

TAG: Nala_009_f
Just kidding. Remy already tried a bite of it. It's tasty and safe.

TAG: Nala_010_f
Oh, good.
