{PlayerName}, would you like to hear a story from when Simba and I were cubs?

TAG: Nala_001_f
I could tell you about elephant tag. That's a game I made up.

TAG: Nala_013_f
Or about the time we almost got killed in the elephant graveyard. Or about the giraffe incident.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Elephant tag.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Giraffe incident.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Elephant graveyard.

TAG: Nala_003_f
All right. Elephant tag is really fun. You find a herd of elephants on the move, and then you tag Simba.

TAG: Nala_006_f
As soon as you tag him, you run under the elephants' feet to get away from him!

TAG: Nala_014_f
It's like regular tag, but you have to make sure you don't get squashed by elephants.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
That sounds fun!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That sounds dangerous.

TAG: Nala_007_f
It was! And I always won.

TAG: Nala_008_f
It wasn't, really. The elephants knew we were there, so they did their best not to step on us.

TAG: Nala_015_f
Simba did get his tail stepped on one time. He was pretty sore about that, but he was fine.

TAG: Nala_004_f
So Simba got this idea that we could ride on a giraffe. We'd hide on the top of a big rock and jump on this giraffe's back when he walked by.

TAG: Nala_009_f
The thing is, we didn't realize that having two lion cubs jump at him from out of nowhere would really scare the giraffe.

TAG: Nala_012_f
When we tried it, the giraffe bolted, ran right into a mud hole, and got stuck. Zazu had to talk a rhino into pulling him out.

TAG: Nala_010_f
We got in so much trouble.

TAG: Nala_005_f
Well, when Simba and I were cubs, we snuck off to explore an elephant graveyard.

TAG: Nala_016_f
It's this creepy place, with skulls bigger than the two of us put together, and holes that shoot out steam. I think you've got a place just like it in the Valley.

TAG: Nala_011_f
It turned out to be a really bad idea. We almost got eaten by hyenas. But Simba's father saved us.
