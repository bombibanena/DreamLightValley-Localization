Hmm...

TAG: EVE_001_f
What's wrong? The console won't turn on?

TAG: EVE_002_f

It looks like there are some empty <ActivityItem>Power Sockets</ActivityItem> around here.

TAG: EVE_005_f
Maybe I can find the <ActivityItem>Power Coils</ActivityItem> that are supposed to go in them scattered around. There sure is a lot of <Lore>rubble</Lore> in here.
