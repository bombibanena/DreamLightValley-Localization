There you go, Jack â all the remaining spider visitors and their web homes!

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Well, come along, my little eight-legged friends. I'll set up a new home for you when I'm back in my lab.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It will match the dÃ©cor.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hope you can read the full message now!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Better there than my House.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Precisely!

TAG: JackSkellington_000_f
Now, to examine the webbing...

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Oh my! {PlayerName}... Sally sent these spiders!

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
That's amazing!

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
Where could she be?

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
Is she going to come back to the Valley?

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
Not just amazing, it's inspired!

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Well, let me get started then!

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
Let me examine the message more closely...

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
Ah yes, now I see the full message! It says...

TAG: JackSkellington_023_f
"Dear Jack, These helpful spiders have promised to assist in making a portal to bring me to you, but they may need your help. Please give them whatever they need. I miss you! â Love, Sally"

TAG: JackSkellington_024_f
Incredible! So the spiders are going to make a portal to bring Sally here?

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Isn't that wonderful?! Oh, but look â these poor spiders are quite tired. I suppose travel between worlds must be taxing.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Oh no! Is there anything I can do to help them feel better?

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Hmm, let me think... Ah, yes! An <ActivityItem>Arachnid Rejuvenation Potion</ActivityItem>!

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
After one of those, I'm certain the spiders will be eager to weave a portal bridging us to Sally.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
So do I, {PlayerName}...

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
I see. You don't like spiders?

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Nooooooooo.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Well, I'll tell them not to wander.
