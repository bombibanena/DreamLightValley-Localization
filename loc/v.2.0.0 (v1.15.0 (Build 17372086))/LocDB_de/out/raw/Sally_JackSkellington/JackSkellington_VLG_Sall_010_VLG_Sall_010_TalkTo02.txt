Hey, Jack! What are you up to?

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
{PlayerName}, it's fascinating! You must take a look. Here...

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Some... rocks?

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
But not just any rocks â a variant of flint! When you strike it, instead of sparks, you'll get a forlorn wail like the cry of a lost spirit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It suits you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Where did the spirit come from?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's... pretty creepy.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Why, thank you!

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. There are still a few wrinkles in the design of my phantom flint, and I could use a moment to iron them out.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
I think I'll give it to Sally on our date. Is she ready?

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
She's just finishing up. But she said there was something missing. She seemed unsure of herself in a way that doesn't feel usual at all.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Ahhh, I think I know the problem. Sally is naturally a bit shy. And I suspect she still feels out of sorts from being stuck in the holiday travel path for so long.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Oh no! What can we do to help?

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
I wonder... Yes, that could be it! If Sally's lost her favorite needle in her travels, she'd feel very out of sorts. She always keeps it with her for any repairs she might need.

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Can you grab me some <ActivityItem>Night Shards</ActivityItem>? I know she and I can make her a new needle out of them.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
And this one will be even better since it will contain the magic of the Shards. Then she can be assured that the ability to fix any rips or tears is right at her fingertips!

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
Sure, Jack! I'll head out now.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Oh, it's merely an imitation. A little trick.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Not to worry. No actual ghosts are involved.
