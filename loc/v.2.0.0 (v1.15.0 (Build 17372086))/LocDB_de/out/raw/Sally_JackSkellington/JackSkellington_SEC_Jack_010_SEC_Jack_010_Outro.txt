How are you feeling, Jack?

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Elated! Excited! Like it's Halloween Eve and energy is COURSING through me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Well, I'm happy that you're happy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Halloween Eve?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Bet you've got some plans in mind already!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
I couldn't be more so.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. I didn't realize how much I missed Sally until the spiders arrived.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
I'd been so busy throwing myself into my research.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
But it will all be that much better now that I can share it with Sally!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Always happy to help a couple get back together!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm happy that you're happy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I bet the two of you could use some space now.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Thank you again. But please, check back later. I'm sure Sally would love some help settling in.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Will do! Now you two love-bats have some fun together!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Yes! The anticipation for all the frights, chills, tricks, and treats just grows and grows as midnight approaches before Halloween. Now then...

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Oh, so many!
