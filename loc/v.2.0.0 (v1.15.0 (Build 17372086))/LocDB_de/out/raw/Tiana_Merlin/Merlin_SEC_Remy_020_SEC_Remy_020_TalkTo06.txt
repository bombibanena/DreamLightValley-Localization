Hey Merlin, can we talk food for a moment?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Of course. And what sort of food do you wish to discuss, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I recently recalled a memory of you sharing a meal with some other Villagers in the Glade of Trust.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
It came out of this magical-looking cookbook, and I'm trying to figure out the recipe... I think it might be the key to finding the Villager who cooked it.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Remy already confirmed that it needs <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
I've already spoken with Moana and Mickey. They remembered that the dish had <ActivityItem>Onion</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Yes, yes, this is sounding familiar. Let me just think for a moment...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Hmm... oh! It's coming back to me!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I do recall sharing that dish. It was quite tasty and rather spicy.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Ahh, so <ActivityItem>Chili Peppers</ActivityItem> are the next Ingredient? Got it!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Just a moment, {PlayerName}. That dish wasn't just spicy, it was magically spicy!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
I had completely forgotten, but luckily the magic in these peppers has preserved them nicely!

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Awesome; I think I have everything I need to make the dish now!

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Thanks, Merlin!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Perfect. Thanks, Merlin!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Mickey was sure that the dish included <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Moana was positive the dish included <ActivityItem>Onion</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
And you're the first person I've spoken to so far.
