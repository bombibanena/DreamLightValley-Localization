Merlin, I'm back! The dish turned out to be <ActivityItem>Enchanted Shrimp ÃtouffÃ©e</ActivityItem>. Would you like a taste?

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Of course!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
... Mmm. {PlayerName}, this is quite good!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
And... Oh my! This delicious dish has brought back a memory!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Oh, awesome! What of?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
The skilled chef who first made this dish... I remember lending her an enchanted cookbook.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds tasty!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds... risky.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'd take the gamble for good food.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Yes. The recipes it contained were... well, I suppose the correct word is scrumptious!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
But when magic is brought into the equation, there's always an elevated risk.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I wonder... What if our mystery chef was somehow trapped in the cookbook?

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Wow, is that even possible?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Why, {PlayerName}, magic is the art of making the impossible possible!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Well, that might explain where the chef disappeared to.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Oh my! Look, {PlayerName} â the magic of this dish is doing something!

TAG: Merlin_013_f
I would suggest that you continue sharing this marvelous dish. Sharing food among friends is its own special magic, you know.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
How right you are! Magic is useful, but there's always an element of risk.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Clearly, this chef agreed with you!
