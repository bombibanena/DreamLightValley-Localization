I spoke to the other Villagers and gathered these <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is there anything else we need for the spell?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I sure hope this enchantment works.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Make with the "Higitus Figitus."

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Spell? What spellâ

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Oh. Oh dear... I'm... heh... well, I'm afraid we've had a bit of a misunderstanding.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I merely needed these <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> for my research. Terribly sorry.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
I thought you understood. No, no... I'm afraid there isn't any sort of spell or enchantment that will solve Minnie's problem.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
But there must be some way to help her?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Then why'd you make me do all that work?!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Oh, yes. Not to worry. There certainly is.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
You see, what protects Minnie, what protects all of us here... is an altogether different sort of magic.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Friendship, love, care â that's what binds this Valley together. And kind words and small favors are the source of all this magic.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Minnie simply needs to be shown that spirit will never leave this place.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
So that's why you wanted me to talk to some of the other Villagers. If I tell Minnie what they said...

TAG: Merlin_010_f
...it will remind her of the love that binds us all together... and that everyone is safe here so long as we never forget it again.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
I'll give it a try! Thanks, Merlin.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Just a moment, just a moment! I'm getting to that.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Enchantment? What enchantmentâ

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Now see here! I'm not some sort of machine you put <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> into and magic comes out!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Er, right. Sorry. I just meant... now you have everything for the enchantment, right?
