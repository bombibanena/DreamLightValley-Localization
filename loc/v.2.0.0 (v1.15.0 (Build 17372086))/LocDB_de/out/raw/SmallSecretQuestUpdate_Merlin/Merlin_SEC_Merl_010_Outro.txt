Well, {PlayerName}? Have you uncovered what Ursula and Mother Gothel are scheming about?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Those ingredients and vials they're trading â they must be potions. But for what?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Ursula told me it was just something to get rid of pests in the Giant Willow.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Ha! I find that most unlikely.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
She and Mother Gothel... they just seem to be friends.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Friends?! Balderdash! I don't buy it for a second. Ursula doesn't have friends. Just people she can use.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe it's just not our business?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We should leave her alone for now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're right. I still don't trust her.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
I say any magical malfeasance in this Village is my business!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
*sigh* But... In the absence of proof, if you insist that there's no scheming going on...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I'll leave them be for now.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I only hope we don't regret this.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Now then, I've concocted a little something to thank you for your help.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Here. A bit of <ActivityItem>Dreamlight</ActivityItem> ought to compensate you for your trouble.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Oh, come now. We can hardly trust Ursula's word.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Nor do I. We'll need to keep a closer eye on those two.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
But for now, I suspect your little chat with Ursula may have deterred her from whatever schemes she's been concocting.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. Dreamlight Valley owes you another great debt.
