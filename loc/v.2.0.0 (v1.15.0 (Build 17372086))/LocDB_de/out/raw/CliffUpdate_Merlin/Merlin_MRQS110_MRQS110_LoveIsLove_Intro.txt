{PlayerName}! Precisely who I was hoping to see.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
I'm certain you've noticed the rather snowy problem we have on our hands.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
There's a blizzard in the Frosted Heights. But it isn't a mere meteorological happenstance. There's Dark Magic afoot.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Magical blizzard? Sounds like a job for Elsa.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Well, ordinarily, I'd say yes. And I do mean to consult her...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
...but there's something quite... unnatural about this storm. I fear even Elsa's magic won't be able to quell it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What a magical mess. What should we do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let me guess. I'm the only one who can fix this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Thanks. I'll find some mittens and stay away from the blizzard.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
To set this right, we'll need to <Lore>restore the Pillar in the Frosted Heights</Lore>. That should keep all the vexing Dark Magic at bay.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
How do I restore the Pillar? I suppose I'll need to find the Orb, like with the others?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Precisely! But I'm afraid it's easier said than done. The Orb has been missing from the Frosted Heights since shortly after the Forgetting began.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
And itâ Oh dear, it's been missing so long that I can't remember which virtue powered its magic. What could it have been...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Punctuality?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Tidiness?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Not chewing with your mouth open?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Hmm. Arriving precisely when one is needed, if not earlier, is a virtue indeed.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
But whatever powered this Pillar was something more... elemental.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Whatever it was, I'm afraid you'll have trouble finding the Orb. That blizzard means you won't be able to see an inch beyond your nose.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
I suggest you start by investigating the center of the mystical activity. You must <Lore>search the blizzard for the source of the disturbance.</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_014_f
And act quickly! The storm is growing larger. If we don't stop it soon, I fear it will swallow up the entire Valley.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Oh, and {PlayerName}? I suggest you dress for the weather. It's going to be downright frigid!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Knowing precisely where everything ought to be and putting it there is a virtue indeed.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
One in short supply around this Valley, I'm afraid...

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Why, that's just basic manners and decency, {PlayerName}! Unless you're a dog, of course. Not exactly within their nature. Oh...

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Well, uh... heh-heh... Yes. That's precisely what I was about to say.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Perhaps your magical skills extend to prognostication, after all. Now...

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Oh no, no, no, that won't do at all! If we don't stop this soon, you won't be safe from it anywhere in the Village.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
The situation is starting to, well, er... snowball. It won't be long before we're all under ten feet of snow.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
So... what am I supposed to do to stop it?
