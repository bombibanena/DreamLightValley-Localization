How cunning of you. This is the sort of thinking you will need to outsmart the Mastermind!

TAG: Anna_058_f
I reach out slowly and take my staff back...

TAG: Anna_000_f
Oh, {PlayerName}! You're here! Err... I mean...

TAG: Anna_001_f
How fascinating! Someone approaches the Wizard... (Um, what was that name again? Oh, right!) ... Chockany Gumbottom!

TAG: Anna_002_f
I'm a wizened old wizard with a very long beard and a pointy hat and tiny little glasses.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I want to save the kingdom!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How do I stop the Mastermind?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Your Merlin impression needs work.

TAG: Anna_059_f
It's been so long since I had a friend to share frozen treats with me...

TAG: Anna_060_f
As you rush towards me, I gasp and dive out of the way!

TAG: Anna_061_f
Stop!

TAG: Anna_062_f
Only a true Hero or a true daredevil would rush at a powerful wizard like me!

TAG: Player_014_choice_000_f
Maybe I'm both.

TAG: Player_014_choice_001_f
So... I win?

TAG: Anna_063_f
Either way, you are just what the kingdom needs!

TAG: Anna_064_f
Indeed, you do! You have proven your bravery on this day!

TAG: Anna_065_f
Wait... what?!

TAG: Anna_066_f
Uh... the umm... The sugar fairy crunches, and you realize it's not a fairy! Just enchanted rock candy.

TAG: Anna_067_f
You see through my illusion, and the fairies turn into lumps of rock candy and drop all around us.

TAG: Anna_068_f
With a twirl of my candy-striped staff, I summon a mighty peppermint wind!

TAG: Player_015_choice_000_f
I hate peppermint!

TAG: Player_015_choice_001_f
You won't stop me, Chockany!

TAG: Anna_069_f
Then surrender!

TAG: Player_016_choice_000_f
The kingdom is counting on me!

TAG: Player_016_choice_001_f
I refuse!

TAG: Anna_070_f
My eyes soften as you brave the peppermint wind with courage and determination.

TAG: Anna_071_f
With a wave of my candy-striped staff, the wind stops.

TAG: Anna_072_f
You have proven you will put the kingdom before all else!

TAG: Anna_073_f
I trudge forward through the freezing peppermint wind. One foot at a time...

TAG: Anna_074_f
The Futurist! I wonder... can your imaginative powers save us from boredom?

TAG: Anna_075_f
Oh, a Noble Hero. Could it be that you really were born for a great purpose... to save us from boredom and stop the Mastermind?

TAG: Anna_076_f
You must <Lore>rescue our Princess and get the keys to the chest where all fun has been locked away!</Lore> But, one thing at a time! *harrumph*

TAG: Anna_077_f
I told Vanellope I should have a costume beard but she said it "wasn't in her budget"?

TAG: Anna_078_f
But this is still fun, right? ... Anyway! Ahem!

TAG: Anna_079_f
Come closer, Hero. Let these old magical eyes have a look at you. Hrm hrm...

TAG: Anna_003_f
Yes, yes, *harrumph*, so do we all! I myself tried with my... gumball incantations many times with no result.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Now, let these old and very magical eyes have a look at you...

TAG: Anna_005_f
A humble Farmer? Could you be the Hero who will save us all from boredom?

TAG: Anna_006_f
Here's a secret... <Lore>I have the first key,</Lore> but I can only give it to the true Hero!

TAG: Anna_007_f
And to prove you're a Hero, you must defeat me in a "spellcaster's duel"!

TAG: Anna_008_f
I raise my candy-striped wizard staff and <Lore>send a rain of stale chocolate cupcakes at you!</Lore>

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I catch some and throw them back at you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Good, I'm hungry! I eat a cupcake!

TAG: Anna_009_f
You have impressive reflexes! A cupcake hits me in the shoulder! I'm smeared with buttercream and stagger back.

TAG: Anna_010_f
As I fall, the ground under your feet starts to soften. I've made it into a hot fudge sink pit!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
*gasp* Chockany! You're sinking too!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I leap to solid ground!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Anybody have some ice cream?

TAG: Anna_011_f
Oh no! My spell was too powerful!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Don't worry; I'll save us!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Hm. Guess we'll sink together.

TAG: Anna_012_f
You... would save me?

TAG: Anna_013_f
I wave my candy-striped staff. We're on solid ground again.

TAG: Anna_014_f
You have proven yourself to be brave AND selfless. You are the Hero the kingdom needs. Take this.

TAG: Anna_015_f
The first key is yours!

TAG: Anna_016_f
My eyes grow wide as we start to sink into the delicious fudge until we're almost up to our necks!

TAG: Anna_017_f
It will be a chocolate drowning! ... But then!

TAG: Anna_018_f
My staff starts to glow and WHOOSH! We're on solid ground again. The fudge is gone.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Did I win?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I didn't even get any fudge!

TAG: Anna_019_f
You have proved that you are fearless, determined, and immune to fudge! YOU are the Hero the kingdom needs.

TAG: Anna_020_f
There will be fountains of fudge when you save the kingdom from boredom...

TAG: Anna_021_f
You won't get rid of me that easily!

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
I charge at you!

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
I summon a hail of rainbow sprinkles!

TAG: Anna_022_f
Ahh! I'm not used to non-magical confrontation!

TAG: Anna_023_f
As you rush at me, I throw my candy-striped staff down between us...

TAG: Anna_024_f
Have mercy on an old wizard!

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
I'll spare you, Chockany.

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
I win the duel!

TAG: Anna_025_f
You have proven yourself a Hero of mercy and might!

TAG: Anna_026_f
You have won the first key. You ARE the hero we need.

TAG: Anna_027_f
Yes, you have proven you're fearless in the face of my magical might!

TAG: Anna_028_f
Ow! Ow! Pellets of colorful confections hail from the sky!

TAG: Anna_029_f
*gasp* You can do candy magic?!

TAG: Anna_030_f
Only the chosen Hero could master candy magic without training...

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
I'm more than I seem.

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
I'm a magic genius!

TAG: Anna_031_f
Indeed! And you will become much more very soon, Hero...

TAG: Anna_032_f
Take the first key and save the kingdom with this old wizard's blessing!

TAG: Anna_033_f
You are! Perhaps once you save the kingdom, we can teach each other more candy magic!

TAG: Anna_034_f
Did... did you say "ice cream"?

TAG: Player_008_choice_000_f
I'm hungry, okay?

TAG: Player_008_choice_001_f
You said I'm sinking in fudge, right?

TAG: Anna_035_f
Ice cream is my FAVORITE food. My eyes glaze over in a dreamy daze...

TAG: Anna_036_f
I wave my candy-striped staff...

TAG: Anna_037_f
WHOOSH! The ground beneath our feet becomes solid again. I approach you...

TAG: Anna_038_f
Sweet Hero, ice cream is always the answer. You are the one the kingdom needs!

TAG: Anna_039_f
The first key is yours!

TAG: Anna_040_f
Yes! And hot fudge and ice cream go perfectly together!

TAG: Anna_041_f
What is this?! My attack failed?!

TAG: Anna_042_f
I summon a cloud of sugar fairies to swarm you!

TAG: Player_009_choice_000_f
I rush you through the fairies!

TAG: Player_009_choice_001_f
I eat a sugar fairy.

TAG: Anna_043_f
The sweet fairies sting like sleet as you run at me!

TAG: Anna_044_f
I raise my candy-striped staff, and the ground transforms to ice under your running feet.

TAG: Anna_045_f
And it's lingonberry-flavored!

TAG: Player_010_choice_000_f
I slip on the delicious ice!

TAG: Player_010_choice_001_f
I transform my footwear into candy cane skates!

TAG: Anna_046_f
You crash to the lingonberry ice! BAM!

TAG: Player_011_choice_000_f
I get up slowly...

TAG: Player_011_choice_001_f
I lick the lingonberry ice rink!

TAG: Anna_047_f
My eyes grow wide as I watch you rise, fearless and determined.

TAG: Anna_048_f
Wait! We do not need to duel any longer.

TAG: Anna_049_f
You have shown me that you are brave and can resist sugar ice! You ARE the Hero we need!

TAG: Anna_050_f
Wow, this magical ice is so good!

TAG: Anna_051_f
R-really? No one has complimented my magical lingonberry ice in so long...

TAG: Anna_052_f
I also kneel and lick a part of the ice!

TAG: Player_012_choice_000_f
I steal your candy-striped wizard staff!

TAG: Player_012_choice_001_f
We enjoy the nice moment and lingonberry ice.

TAG: Anna_053_f
*gasp* No, not my staff!

TAG: Player_013_choice_000_f
Just kidding! Have it back.

TAG: Player_013_choice_001_f
I'll trade you for the first key.

TAG: Anna_054_f
Oh... Oh thank you! My candy-striped staff is also my best friend!

TAG: Anna_055_f
A Hero is not only brave or smart but also kind. You are certainly all of those things.

TAG: Anna_056_f
Take the first key, with the regards of this old and wise wizard!
