Here to congratulate me on the winning dish, I presume?

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Well, I gracefully accept. I'd like to thank my Schmoopsie-Poo for being my eternal inspiration, and Tiana for her excellent guidance â even if I didn't need it.

Whoa, let's not get ahead of ourselves here â I haven't decided on a winner yet.

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
You haven't?!

What was some of the inspiration behind your variation on the okra soup?

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Just some good ol' Monstropolis spice mixes. Kicks it up a little and gives that nice tang that says "I've been marinating in the sun for three weeks"!

Gross.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's... something.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
If I were you, I'd warn people about that beforehand...

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I beg your pardon.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Still â not too bad!
