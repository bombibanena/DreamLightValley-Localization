Hi Mike. Got a sec?

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
What am I, a walking clock?

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Nah, I've got Oswald if I need one of those.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Love the energy, Mike. I'll let Tiana know.

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Sure, what's going on, {PlayerName}?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
So Tiana is putting together a cooking contest.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Ahh, and you need my unique culinary experience as one of the judges?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Uhh, actually I was wondering if you wanted to compete.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Me? Compete?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
{PlayerName}, I hope this is a real challenge if you're coming to me. Sulley will tell ya I am an excellent cook! Some might even call me a chef!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Well, it's for cooking Cajun food. Pretty sure that's kinda new to you.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Well, if it's even footing, I'll compete. I won't need to feel bad when I win by a landslide.
