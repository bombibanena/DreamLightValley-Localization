Whew, what a workout!

TAG: Oswald_002_f
I cleared out my obstacles. How did you do?

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Workout? Ha! I barely broke a sweat!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Oh really? You suddenly an expert with the Pickaxe?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Pickaxe? Who needs that?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
We do... to remove the obstacles?

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Nah, I just erased 'em!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why am I surprised...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Erased? Like with a pencil eraser?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
I gotta say, Oswald, I don't think this is what Gaston had in mind...

TAG: Oswald_018_f
Just when I think I understand you...

TAG: Oswald_010_f
How come? Now he's got some swell holes to fill up with whatever he wants!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Holes? You erased the obstacles and left a bunch of holes?

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Yessiree!

TAG: Oswald_013_f
I should probably fill those in. I don't want Gaston stalking around in a huff because he tripped over a hole...

TAG: Oswald_014_f
Now are these regular holes in the ground, or are they Oswaldian holes that will react in a weird way?

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Well, I made 'em. You tell me.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
They're actually real full. Of emptiness!

TAG: Oswald_017_f
But once you stomp down the emptiness, the holes'll be filled with not-emptiness all the way to the top.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
You betcha!
