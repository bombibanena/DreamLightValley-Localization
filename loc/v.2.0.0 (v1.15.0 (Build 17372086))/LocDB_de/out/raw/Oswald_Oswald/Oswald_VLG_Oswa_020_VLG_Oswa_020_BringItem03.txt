Hrm, what? What's all this, I say?!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Ahh, I'm sorry, {PlayerName}. I'm rather tired and in a less-than-jovial mood. But I shouldn't take it out on you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's OK; I'd be in a lousy mood too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I accept your apology!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Maybe I can help you with that! Here, have a sip of this.

Little warning â there may be some... linguistic effects.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Linguistic effects? From <i>Coffea arabica</i>?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
*sip sip*

<i>Hotsy-totsy! I'd pay good dough for another cup of this joe!</i>

TAG: Merlin_007_f
*gasp* What?!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Aaaand, there's the Oswaldian speech, right on schedule.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Will do!

<i>I was thinkin' of hittin' the hay, but now I'm gonna go cut a rug down at the dance hall!</i>

TAG: Merlin_018_f
You... OK, Merlin?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
<i>You betcha! For sure I can get a wiggle on now!</i>

TAG: Merlin_009_f
You back to normal yet?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Hmm... <i>Higitus Figitus!</i> ... <i>Blast it all</i>... Yes, yes, all is well again. How strange! And what unusual magic.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
That's Oswald for you! And I don't even think it's magic. Things just... work differently with him.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Well, please convey my thanks to him, even if it came with a bit of a surprise.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Huh? Merlin... you sound like Oswald!
