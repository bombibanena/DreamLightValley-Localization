OK, I found all the missing clocks.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Zowie!

TAG: Oswald_017_f
They made me run around, but I gotta admit, they're pretty cute!

TAG: Oswald_021_f
You betcha they are!

TAG: Oswald_022_f
Huh? What's that, clocks?

TAG: Oswald_023_f
Wait, you're... talking to them?

TAG: Oswald_018_f
Gee, sorry {PlayerName}, but Foxtrot here just said that ain't the last of 'em.

TAG: Oswald_024_f
We're gonna hafta make tracks and find the last three.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
There are more?!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Of course there are more...

TAG: Oswald_019_f
Aw, you know how things go...

TAG: Oswald_025_f
The clocks say that they were so excited, they were beside themselves...

TAG: Oswald_026_f
And then they ACTUALLY were beside themselves! More of 'em just... happened. We gotta stop this before it becomes a clock-aclysm!

TAG: Oswald_027_f
Well, I guess I'm heading back out. Any idea where they might be hiding?

TAG: Oswald_028_f
Sure! Tango said Rumba's <Lore>taking a swim off Ancient's Landing</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_029_f
Conga's <Lore>restin' under a rock in the Wild Tangle</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_030_f
And little Waltz is <Lore>tryin' to get a tan in the Glittering Dunes</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_031_f
OK, thanks for the tip â I'll get back to the hunt!

TAG: Oswald_020_f
Aw, you know how it is with alarm clocks â they're bustin' out with emotions.
