Thanks for nothin', luck!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's what happens when you challenge someone like me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, Oswald; that's how things shook out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Have you considered actually taking the challenges seriously?

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Ooo, look who's feisty.

TAG: Oswald_001_f
I just don't get it. Usually when I take on a challenge, I get a lucky break that gets me out on top.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Do you need to take a break and re-vulcanize your luck?

TAG: Oswald_007_f
No way, bub! I'm not giving up!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oh yeah? Shall we find someone else to judge another challenge?

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Nah. I got a better idea â a foot race!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Let's go!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You sure? With my Dreamlight Magic, I can zoom around pretty fast.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
This is the one for me. C'mon, luck!

TAG: Oswald_012_f
We'll start at <Lore>Ancient's Landing</Lore>, head to a checkpoint in <Lore>the Wild Tangle</Lore>, then to <Lore>the Glittering Dunes</Lore> and wind it up in the <Lore>Cave of Wonders</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_019_f
I already put up some balloon arches to mark each checkpoint.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Hmm, are you sure you can even get into the Cave?

TAG: Oswald_014_f
You need to be a Diamond in the Rough to get in.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Oh, I'll get in, {PlayerName}. You just worry about your own self.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
C'mon; let's head over to <Lore>Ancient's Landing</ActivityItem> so we can start the race!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Oh, I'm real speedy â you'll see.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Ah, no hard feelings. You won fair and square.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Ya mean do the expected? The usual? The run-o-the-mill? Where's the fun in that?
