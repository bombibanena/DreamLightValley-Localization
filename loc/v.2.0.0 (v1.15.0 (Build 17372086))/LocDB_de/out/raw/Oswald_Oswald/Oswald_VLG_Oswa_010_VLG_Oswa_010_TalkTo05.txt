You want to gather some flowers?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not what I was expecting, but let's go for it!

TAG: Oswald_000_f
OK, how do I look?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
Oswald's jaw actually drops to the floor, and he applauds excitedly.

TAG: Oswald_002_f
He mimes rolling out a carpet in front of you and then puffs out his chest and mimes adjusting a bowtie.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
I'll take that as a sign of approval!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
So, now that I've dressed the part, what did you have in mind?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Oswald ponders for a moment before dashing about and picking flowers like a farmer late with their harvest.

TAG: Oswald_006_f
He stacks them together and pushes them over. He looks at you expectantly.

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oswald frowns for a moment then shrugs and smiles.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Cool! Any colors in particular?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Oswald furrows his brow, seeming more confused than a horse hitched to a Model T.

Given your color palette, I'm gonna go with <Lore>black-and-white flowers</Lore>.
