Hi Gaston...

TAG: Gaston_001_f
*grumblegrumblegrumble* ...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, I get it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Wow, nice to see you too!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Good. Because that rabbit's a menace!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
I know, I know â Oswald messed up with those alarm clocks.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
So we wanted to give you some special coffee to try and make up for it.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Just lemme give you a minor heads-up about the coffee â it's got a bit of a weird kick to it...

TAG: Gaston_008_f
I can handle any beverage! Give it here.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
*gulp gulp gulp*

TAG: Gaston_010_f
<i>Gee whillikers, {PlayerName}; this cup o' joe's the berries!</i>

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Err, uh, I mean...

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Honestly, you speaking in slang is pretty funny â I'm not even mad on your behalf.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
<i>This coffee sure is swanky! I ain't no dewdropper now!</i>

TAG: Gaston_013_f
AHHHH, what's happening to me?!

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Oswald's coffee has some of his linguistic traits...

TAG: Gaston_015_f
<i>I've half a mind to play him some chin music!</i>

TAG: Gaston_025_f
Whoa there; just relax for a second.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Ahem... <i>Don't I deserve the best? </i>... <i>How can you read this? There's no pictures!</i> Phew! I recognize myself once again.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
That was... strange.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Though the coffee was quite delicious.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
But tell that rabbit he better keep those alarm clocks under control!

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Trust me, Gaston... I feel the same way.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
It seems that Oswald's coffee has some of his linguistic traits...

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Whoa! What's going on? Why are you speaking like Oswald?

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Well, I do enjoy gifts.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Are you planning on waking me from my needed rest, too?
