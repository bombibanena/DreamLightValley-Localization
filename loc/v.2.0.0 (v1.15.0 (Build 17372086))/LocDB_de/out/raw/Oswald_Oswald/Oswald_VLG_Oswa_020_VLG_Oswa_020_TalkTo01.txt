Hey Oswald, how are you liking the alarm clocks?

TAG: Oswald_029_f
I don't see them around here. What happened?

TAG: Oswald_030_f
Oh... uh, I wanted 'em to get some sun, so I... I... I put 'em outside!

TAG: Oswald_031_f
That's strange; I didn't see them outside when I came over.

TAG: Oswald_033_f
What...? Oh, right! It looked like it was gonna rain, so I put 'em in storage.

TAG: Oswald_034_f
You're acting a little strangely.

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Me? No! I'm actin' busy. Waitâ Not <i>actin'</i> busy; I AM busy!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
I gotta catch up with Stitch, launder my duds, wash my hair, and lotsa other important stuff.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
OK, I get it; you're a busy guy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
... Wash your hair?

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Yep, no time for dawdlin'; gotta get a wiggle on!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh, that's a shame.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's... odd.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
What if I just drop by while you're out?

TAG: Oswald_019_f
Gee, they all split, {PlayerName}, and amscrayed in different directions.

TAG: Oswald_020_f
I betcha could find some in each of the Biomes, though.

TAG: Oswald_021_f
All righty, time to check <Lore>Ancient's Landing</Lore>, <Lore>the Glittering Dunes</Lore>, and <Lore>the Wild Tangle</Lore>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Can you tell me a little more about the clocks?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Time to head out!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
*sigh* Okay, I guess the jig's up. I gotta level with ya, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
The alarm clocks are gone. They're out there runnin' wild.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
Like... literally?

TAG: Oswald_014_f
Aw, please don't get sore with me! I just tried to glad 'em up a little with this special key I got.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Then, the next thing I knew, their little legs took 'em out the door and into the wide world of <Lore>Eternity Isle</Lore>!

TAG: Oswald_016_f
And... well, there's no tellin' where they are now.

TAG: Oswald_017_f
Oof, well I can help you find them â can't have a bunch of animated alarm clocks running around and waking everyone up!

TAG: Oswald_018_f
Any idea where they went?

TAG: Oswald_035_f
Course I can! Which of 'em do you wanna hear about? There's <ActivityItem>Charleston</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Foxtrot</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Texas Tommy</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Tell me about them!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Never mind, I'm good. Bye!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Charleston?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Foxtrot?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Texas Tommy?

TAG: Player_004_choice_003_f
Actually, never mind; I'm gonna head out.

TAG: Oswald_037_f
Well, <ActivityItem>Charleston</ActivityItem> is real popular! All the other clocks get inspired by its peppy dancin'!

TAG: Oswald_040_f
Wanna hear about the others?

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
Sure!

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
It's fine. I'll go looking for them now.

TAG: Oswald_036_f
Okey-dokey! There's <ActivityItem>Lindy Hop</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Tango</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Shimmy</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Swing</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
Tell me about <ActivityItem>Lindy Hop</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Tango</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
Tell me about <ActivityItem>Shimmy</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Swing</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_007_choice_002_f
Never mind; I'll get to looking for them.

TAG: Oswald_041_f
Aw, <ActivityItem>Lindy Hop</ActivityItem> is a real city clock! When it dances, it's got moves from all the hoppin' spots.

TAG: Oswald_043_f
And <ActivityItem>Tango</ActivityItem>... Sheesh. So dramatic!

TAG: Oswald_045_f
Did you name all of them yourself?

TAG: Oswald_046_f
Sure did! I took one look at how each of 'em moved, and their names hit me like a bonk on the ol' melon!

TAG: Oswald_047_f
How wonderful! Hopefully these insights help me catch them more easily.

TAG: Oswald_022_f
Good luck! (Heh-heh. You're gonna need it.)

TAG: Oswald_042_f
<ActivityItem>Shimmy</ActivityItem>'s all about the shoulders when it dances. Which is downright impressive since I didn't think clocks had shoulders!

TAG: Oswald_044_f
And <ActivityItem>Swing</ActivityItem> just can't keep its feet on the floor!

TAG: Oswald_038_f
Well, <ActivityItem>Foxtrot</ActivityItem> is extra classy and elegant! It makes the other clocks pretty jealous!

TAG: Oswald_039_f
Gee, that clock can swing! It's what ya might call a real athletic dancer.

TAG: Oswald_032_f
Did I say wash my hair? I meant wash my... lair. My House! Gee, it's a real mess!

TAG: Oswald_002_f
Do they match your place well enough?

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Oh? Yeah, they're, uh... they're swell!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Good to hear!

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Can I see how you've set them up?

TAG: Oswald_006_f
I love seeing how the different Villagers decorate their homes!

TAG: Oswald_000_f
Sheesh, I... I'm sorry, but the clocks are all takin' a nap. All that tickin' can sure tucker 'em out!
