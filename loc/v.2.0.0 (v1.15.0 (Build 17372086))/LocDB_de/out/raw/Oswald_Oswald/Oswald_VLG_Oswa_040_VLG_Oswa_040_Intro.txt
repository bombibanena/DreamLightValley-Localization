TAG: Oswald_003_f
The trolley! Ya know it, don'tcha?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sure, it's a form of transportation.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Uhh, not really.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
"Form of" â are ya kiddin' me?! Trolleys are LOTS more than that!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
Trolleys mean adventure! Excitement! Why, I been nuts for trolleys since I saw my first one.

TAG: Oswald_007_f
And now Eternity Isle's finally ready for its own trolley!

TAG: Oswald_008_f
That's great! How do we go about getting one?

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Well gee, trolleys are real sensitive. They only respond to folks wearin' the right uniform.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
The trolley is... alive?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
OK, what kind of uniform?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
You betcha!
