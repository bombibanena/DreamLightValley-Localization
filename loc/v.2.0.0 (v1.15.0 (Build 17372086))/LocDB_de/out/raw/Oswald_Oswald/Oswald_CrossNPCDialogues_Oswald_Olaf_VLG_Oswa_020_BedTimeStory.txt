Get those gums flappin', snow chum; these clock tots need a story!

So the clockmaker began to build a great big tower.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
After weeks and weeks of building, the clockmaker finally set the alarm clock at the very top...

TAG: Oswald_014_f
...where it was free to ring out the time to the whole village, for evermore.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Hey, I think they're asleep!

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Shhh!

Actually, I'm not sure I have gums, but I understand. Ahem... Once upon a time, there was a tiny clock that lived on a clockmaker's bedside table.

TAG: Oswald_005_f
But every night the little clock dreamed of being a big clock tower!

TAG: Oswald_006_f
Ya gotta dream big and get that cabbage!

TAG: Oswald_007_f
One day, the clockmaker forgot to set the alarm for the morning.

TAG: Oswald_008_f
But the faithful little clock knew that the clockmaker needed to wake up...

TAG: Oswald_009_f
So it rang the alarm anyway!

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Tried-and-true, just like me!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
The clockmaker was thankful and wanted to share the little clock's abilities with everyone...
