Hi Olaf, I was wondering if you could help me out with something.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I know, it's a little strange...

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Of course, {PlayerName}. I love helping my friends!

TAG: Olaf_002_f
What can I do?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Well, Oswald has these alarm clocks that have come to life...

TAG: Olaf_004_f
That happened to me! It's very fun.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
At first, yes, but they're starting to become something of a hassle. They've been running wild and waking people up.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
But I was thinking... could you help them calm down?

TAG: Olaf_007_f
We need them to take it down a notch and only get excited in the morning when they're supposed to wake Oswald up.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Are you saying that I should tell a story to an audience of alarm clocks?!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Wow... I've never had an audience like that before... I can't wait!

TAG: Olaf_010_f
I'll meet you and Oswald <Lore>at Oswald's House with the alarm clocks</Lore>.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
I have so many story ideas already...
