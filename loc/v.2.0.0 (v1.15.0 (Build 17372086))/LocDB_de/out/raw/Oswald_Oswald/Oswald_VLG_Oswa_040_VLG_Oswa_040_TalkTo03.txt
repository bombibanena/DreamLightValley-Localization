OK Oswald, I finally finished distributing the "Missing" posters.

Aces! Now folks all over Eternity Isle are keepin' an eye out for the trolley.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Amazing! Any luck?

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Yeah! The trolley's been spotted flying over the water around Ancient's Landing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Excuse me, flying?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Great, let's go get it!

TAG: Oswald_000_f
Yep, that sure threw me for a loop, too!

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Dancin' through the clouds, wind rufflin' through its luggage compartments...

TAG: Oswald_012_f
That ain't a sight to miss!

TAG: Oswald_026_f
Great, I'll be back soon with a majestic picture!

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Young trolleys like to take in the sights from the air, but I thought it would've been all tuckered out by now.

TAG: Oswald_016_f
A trolley. The terrestrial public transportation... flying?

TAG: Oswald_017_f
Hey, I ain't talkin' bunk! Get the wool outta your ears, {PlayerName}! The trolley needs our help!

TAG: Oswald_018_f
OK, OK, what's next, then?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Ya mean after we find it?

TAG: Oswald_008_f
Oh, we gotta <Lore>take a photograph</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Take a photo? Why?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
Can't ya see it? Our little trolley, so majestic up in the sky...
