Hey, Gaston; how's it going?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
I've just finished my hourly calisthenics.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Have you come to learn how I maintain my physique?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Among other things!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uhh, let's move past that idea.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Oswald and I were wondering â how would you feel about judging our competition?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
That's the competitive spirit! You get started on the task, and I'll tell the rabbit what to do.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
{PlayerName}, you've sought out the right man! I'm excellent at judging others.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
For example, I judge that neither of you could lift a single barrel of nails, while I can lift two. With each arm.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Uhh, thanks but I need you to set us a task and then judge who did it better.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
I see. Well then, let's make this a contest of strength!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
There are some obstacles that have been annoying me in the <Lore>Glittering Dunes</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Clear out <ActivityItem>3 Copper Rocks</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>3 Glass Stalagmites</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
I'll keep an eye on the two of you and see how things progress.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Sure â Oswald's going down!
