I'm back with your potion Ingredients!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, I gotta run.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The Fairy Godmother would never do something like that!

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Why, thank you, angelfish.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
I hope you'll be a good influence on that Jack Skellington in the future.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Speaking of Jack... where did he run off to?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Well, we were discussing royalty and that good-for-nothing Triton.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
And he mentioned that he was also royalty â the king of pumpkins or some such nonsense.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I said something about that goody two-shoes Fairy Godmother and her pumpkin House, and he seemed quite interested...

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Uh-oh. That can't be good.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
I must admit, I am rather curious. Be a dear and let me know if he gets turned into a mouse.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
That's right. Check on Jack before he instigates another calamity!

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Still, I better go talk to Jack before he causes any trouble...
