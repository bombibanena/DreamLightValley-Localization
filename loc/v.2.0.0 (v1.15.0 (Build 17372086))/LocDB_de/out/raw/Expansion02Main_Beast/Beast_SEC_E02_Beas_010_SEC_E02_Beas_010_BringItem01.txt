Hey Beast... I found these pages lying around. It's a chapter from a book. It seems like something Belle might like.

TAG: Beast_001_f
Hrm... let me see...

TAG: Beast_002_f
Oh. I remember Belle telling me about this story.

TAG: Beast_003_f
She said that she started reading it before the Forgetting but never got to finish it.

TAG: Beast_004_f
Where did you find this?

TAG: Beast_005_f
I found it while exploring the Bind.

TAG: Beast_006_f
The Bind... I remember. There are many books in the Bind that Belle might enjoy. She loves to read.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Me too! I'm a total bookworm.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I wish I had more time to read.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Books put me to sleep. I'd rather scroll my phone.

TAG: Beast_007_f
The books in the Valley have worms in them...?

TAG: Beast_008_f
Uh... figure of speech. Don't worry about it.

TAG: Beast_009_f
Er... All right... {PlayerName}, I have a favor to ask of you.

TAG: Beast_010_f
I want... *sigh* It's hard for me to put it into words...

TAG: Beast_011_f
... I want to create a magical day for Belle. Something worthy of her kindness.

TAG: Beast_012_f
The Bind seems like the perfect place for it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Ooh! This is so romantic. I'd love to help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're a big ol' softie underneath that fur and those claws.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What's stopping you from doing it yourself?

TAG: Beast_013_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Beast_014_f
All right, so, a perfect day for Belle... How would it start?

TAG: Beast_015_f
Well... a perfect day should begin with a perfect gift.

TAG: Beast_016_f
I don't suppose you've found the rest of this book?

TAG: Beast_017_f
If we found it, I could bind it back together.

TAG: Beast_018_f
Good idea. I'll <Lore>try to find the rest of the book</Lore>.

TAG: Beast_019_f
Perhaps you should start by <Lore>checking the shelves in the Library of Lore</Lore>. Now that you've reminded me of the Bind, I recall that it has a library.

TAG: Beast_020_f
In the meantime, I'll look around the Bind and try to think of other ways to make Belle's day special.

TAG: Beast_021_f
Hrm... Well, my fur has been much softer lately since Mr. McDuck sold me someâ

TAG: Beast_022_f
Oh. You didn't mean that literally.

TAG: Beast_023_f
Well... I suppose I haven't known what to do.

TAG: Beast_024_f
Perhaps we could discuss it.

TAG: Beast_025_f
So does Belle. That's why... well, I have a favor to ask of you.

TAG: Beast_026_f
I'm not sure I understand. You prefer scrolls to books?

TAG: Beast_027_f
No, not scrolls, my phoâ Uh, never mind. It would take too long to explain social media to you.

TAG: Beast_028_f
Very well... I won't pry and waste our time because, you see... I have a favor to ask of you.
