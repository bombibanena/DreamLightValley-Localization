Okay, Beast, the Bind is looking cozy and inviting for your day with Belle!

TAG: Beast_001_f
Oh! You've finished?

TAG: Beast_002_f
I'm still struggling with one part of the book...

TAG: Beast_003_f
The very first pages you brought me. I don't know where they go. In which chapter does the heroine discover the true identity of the prince?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Well, I guess the beginning makes the most sense.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Chapter three, obviously.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not until the end, for maximum suspense!

TAG: Beast_004_f
Oh. Yes, I suppose that does seem right.

TAG: Beast_005_f
There! It's finished.

TAG: Beast_006_f
Let's go give it to Belle!

TAG: Beast_007_f
Yes. That's right. That's what Belle told me.

TAG: Beast_008_f
Hmm... I suppose that does make sense.

TAG: Beast_009_f
Okay, Beast, the Bind is looking enchanting and magical for your day with Belle!

TAG: Beast_010_f
Okay, Beast, the Bind is looking... well... perfectly adequate for your day with Belle!
