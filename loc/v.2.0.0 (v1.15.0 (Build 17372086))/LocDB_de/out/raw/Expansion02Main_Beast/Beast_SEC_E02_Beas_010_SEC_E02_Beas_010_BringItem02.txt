You found the other pages of Belle's book! Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Beast_001_f
She'll be so happy she can finally finish the story.

TAG: Beast_002_f
But I can't give it to her in pieces.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Might be fun to read one chapter at a time!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It'll be pretty confusing if she reads it in the wrong order.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess we could put it back together for her.

TAG: Beast_003_f
No, no. She's waited long enough to read the end.

TAG: Beast_004_f
I'll find a way to bind this back together for Belle.

TAG: Beast_005_f
It might take me some time to get the order just right...

TAG: Beast_006_f
Did you think about what else Belle would need for her perfect day?

TAG: Beast_007_f
I did. I would like the Bind to look bright and inviting for her... Maybe <Lore>paths</Lore>, <Lore>lights</Lore>, and something for us to gather around.

TAG: Beast_008_f
I don't suppose you could see to that while I work on the book? I'm not much of a decorator...

TAG: Player_001_f
Don't worry, Beast. I'll make the Bind...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...cozy and inviting!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...enchanting and magical!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...perfectly adequate. I'm not much of a decorator either...

TAG: Beast_009_f
I know Belle will like that. You're very good at making things... welcoming.

TAG: Beast_010_f
I'll go start rearranging these pages and binding the book back together.

TAG: Beast_011_f
Hmm... which of these would go first...? Well, surely "THE END" goes at the back... *sigh*

TAG: Beast_012_f
That's not true. You're very good at this sort of thing. Belle will like whatever you do.

TAG: Beast_013_f
Yes, I'd rather not have the beginnings and endings mixed up.

TAG: Beast_014_f
You've done so much by finding the pages.
