{PlayerName}... here at last to seek my advice on ruling the Village?

TAG: Scar_010_f
Start by instilling fear in your subjects by exiling someone. Goofy, perhaps?

TAG: Scar_011_f
I do need some advice, but not about that.

TAG: Scar_012_f
The Forgotten needs help writing some poetry.

TAG: Player_000_f
I thought you might be able to help because...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...you owe the Forgotten for what you did to them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...you have such a way with words.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...you might be able to relate to their situation.

TAG: Scar_013_f
What I did...? I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

TAG: Scar_026_f
Come on, Scar. Those feelings... they aren't just a little bit familiar?

TAG: Scar_027_f
*sigh* Fine. Perhaps it does remind me of something...

TAG: Scar_001_f
I remember what it was like to watch Mufasa rule over the Pride Lands.

TAG: Scar_002_f
He had no sense of a king's real power! If I were king, every animal there would grovel for my favor.

TAG: Scar_003_f
I told myself I would rule over the darkness until one day I could claim the light.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Scar! That's it! You're a poet and you didn't know it.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Hrm? What are you blathering about?

TAG: Scar_007_f
That's a perfect rhyme! And it's exactly how the Forgotten felt.

TAG: Scar_006_f
<Lore>Nothing I do seems to make the world right...</Lore>

TAG: Scar_008_f
<Lore>...I'll take the darkness if I can't have the light.</Lore>

TAG: Scar_014_f
Years ago, you tricked the Forgotten into helping spread the Night Thorns around the Valley.

TAG: Scar_009_f
... I suppose it does have a certain ring to it, doesn't it?

TAG: Scar_015_f
Oh... Well, if helping you with this poetic problem will put that unpleasantness behind us... do go on.

TAG: Scar_019_f
The Forgotten is looking for a way to complete this verse...

TAG: Scar_021_f
<Lore>I once was the ruler of all I surveyed...</Lore>

TAG: Scar_022_f
<Lore>But now I'm cast out and I feel so afraid.</Lore>

TAG: Scar_023_f
<Lore>Nothing I do seems to make the world right...</Lore>

TAG: Scar_024_f
What should the next line be...?

TAG: Scar_025_f
I haven't the faintest idea. It's not like I could possibly relate.

TAG: Scar_016_f
True. All good kings must know how to speak to their kingdoms.

TAG: Scar_020_f
Fine. I'll help you.

TAG: Scar_018_f
Well, I must admit, I am a bit intrigued.
