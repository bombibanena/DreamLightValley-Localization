Timon and I will think of something else.

Weird. Everything I do usually works on the first try!

I'm not sure what else I can do.

Oh, please! It's so dark and lonely in here. There's gotta be something you can do!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Don't worry, Pumbaa. Timon will stay here with you.

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
I'm going to go get help from someone with the tools to get you free!

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
You gotta help me, {PlayerName}! I ate the bug and now I'm gettin' awful lonely!

Please don't leave me here, {PlayerName}!
