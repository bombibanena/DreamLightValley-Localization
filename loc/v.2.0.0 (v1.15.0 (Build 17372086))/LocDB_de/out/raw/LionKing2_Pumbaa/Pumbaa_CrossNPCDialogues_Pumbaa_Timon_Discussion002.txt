So whaddaya think about the meteorite, Timon? Pretty neat, huh?

Pumbaa, I don't know how to tell you this, but...

...there is no WAY a hunk of metal like that was WAY up in the sky.

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
It was, honest! I saw it fall from way up there to way down here. But how it got up there's a big mystery.

Well... if you saw it, then MAYBE it's true. But that's a very big maybe!
