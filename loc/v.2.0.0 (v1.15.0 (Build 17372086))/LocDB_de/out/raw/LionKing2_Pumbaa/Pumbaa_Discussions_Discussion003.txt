Hey! That's my favorite phrase! Do you remember what it means?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No worries!

Is it about the Circle of Life?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm not sure.

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
That's right!

Whenever ya start to worry, just say: hakuna matata! At least that's what I do.

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Nope. That's somethin' different. "Hakuna matata" means "no worries."

But Simba told me the Circle of Life is pretty important too.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
It means "no worries"!

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
It's our motto. Timon and me, I mean. Helps ya leave the stress behind!
