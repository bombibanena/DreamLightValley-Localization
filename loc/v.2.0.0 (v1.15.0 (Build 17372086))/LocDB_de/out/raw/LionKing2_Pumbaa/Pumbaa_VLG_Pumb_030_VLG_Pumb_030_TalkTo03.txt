I can't believe we found a meteorite!

Or at least pieces of one.

You gotta tell Timon it's not fireflies.

Are meteorites usually all broken up?

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Maybe. I was thinking I might <Lore>repair this one</Lore>... And maybe make it a nice display case? It is Valley history, after all.

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
That's a great idea. Then, we can show Timon and everyone from the Astronomy Club!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Yes! We'll have a special meteorite showcase!

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
You're right. I don't know if he'll believe it though.
