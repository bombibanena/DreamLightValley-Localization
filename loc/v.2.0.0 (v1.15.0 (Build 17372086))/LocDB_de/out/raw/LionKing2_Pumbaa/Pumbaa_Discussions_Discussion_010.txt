Oh, right. That's what you call the sparkly dots in the sky. I've been learnin' lots about 'em since we got back here.

Did you know they sometimes form shapes?

Constellations! I love those! My favorite is...

That's the big bear one, right?

Merlin told me about bears. They're kinda like forest lions without manes. If I ever meet one, I hope they're as nice as Simba.

I know that one! The fish!

I bet that would be Nala's favorite.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
Oh yeah, the little lion!

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
I bet it's real cute.
