Hey, buddy...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You doing okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The plunger worked!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Were you scared in there?

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
Me? I feel great! I had lotsa time stuck there in the dark.

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
Listening to you and Timon work so hard to get me out made me think about how lucky I am.

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Is that silly?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Not at all!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I understand.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
A little, but I get you.

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
Gee, thanks, pal.

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
C'mon, let's <Lore>head back to camp</Lore>!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
Gee, I thought you would.

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
Gee, thanks, pal.

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
It sure did! That was some quick thinkin' on your part, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Maybe a little. But Timon stayed with me, and I knew YOU'D help me.

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Kinda like how when we first met, I felt like I knew ya!
