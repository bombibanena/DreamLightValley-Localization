{PlayerName}, I gotta review tomorrow's lesson with Timon. Could ya <Lore>catch us some Jungle Fireflies for dinner</Lore>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Those fireflies won't see me coming!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Happy to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't have to eat them, right?

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Well, good luck, 'cause they're quick!

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
You should find lots of 'em around here.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
They look kinda like stars, floatin' around all pretty and crunchy!

TAG: Pumbaa_003_f
Aw, that's real nice of you.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
No, but they're awful tasty, if you wanna give 'em a try.
