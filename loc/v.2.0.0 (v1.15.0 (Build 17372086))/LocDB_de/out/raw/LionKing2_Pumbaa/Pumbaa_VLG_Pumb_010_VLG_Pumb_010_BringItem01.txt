Hey, Pumbaa! Here are a couple of foods for you to try...

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Oh, I'm so glad you're here! I was gettin' real worried... and real hungry!

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
Wait â what does food have to do with my aroma?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eat the Onion Puffs. Then I'll explain...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
We think you have a food intolerance...

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
It's cheese's fault.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
No problem!

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
So delicious... But... Oof! My tummy doesn't feel so good...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Eating cheese is causing the smell!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I feel your pain. I can't eat cheese either!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Sorry, buddy. No cheese from here on out.

TAG: Pumbaa_013_f
Now, try eating those <ActivityItem>Gingerbread Cookies</ActivityItem> I made you. They're cheese-free, and the ginger can help your stomach.

TAG: Pumbaa_001_f
Well, they do smell good.

TAG: Pumbaa_002_f
*crunch crunch crunch*

TAG: Pumbaa_018_f
Say, my tummy feels much better now! But... how can I ever go in the restaurant again?

TAG: Pumbaa_019_f
I'm going to help with that too. I also spoke to Daisy and Elsa. They had a few thoughts to help you feel more comfortable at Chez Remy.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
When did you last bathe?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
And I've got just the plan!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
You'll be fine-dining again soon!

TAG: Pumbaa_023_f
Me? Oh... maybe a week or two ago.

TAG: Pumbaa_026_f
I can't really remember.

TAG: Pumbaa_028_f
First things first, Pumbaa. I'm gonna get you a bubble bath.

TAG: Pumbaa_030_f
Bubbles? But how would bubbles get you clean? We warthogs use mud baths.

TAG: Pumbaa_031_f
It keeps you cool, and when it flakes off â you're clean! Gee, I could sure go for a mud bath.

TAG: Pumbaa_032_f
Hmm. All right, Pumbaa. I'll <Lore>make you a mud bath</Lore>.

TAG: Pumbaa_033_f
Thanks! I'm gonna go share some of these cookies with Timon!

TAG: Pumbaa_024_f
Oh boy, really?

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
What's that? I tolerate all kinds of food! In fact, I love it!

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
It means your digestive system doesn't really like certain things. Remy and I think it might be cheese.

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
Try the Onion Puffs I gave you...

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
What? NO! Cheese would never hurt me! It's yummy!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
It's just the theory Remy and I have... Let's test it, okay? Eat the Onion Puffs I made for you.
