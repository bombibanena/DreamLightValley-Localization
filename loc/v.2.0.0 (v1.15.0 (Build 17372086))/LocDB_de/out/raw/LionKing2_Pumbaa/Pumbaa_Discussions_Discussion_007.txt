Worms are yummy. And they're everywhere! Just dig and you'll find some.

TAG: Pumbaa_005_f
And when it rains, they come up by themselves!

Ants are nice and tickly.

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
But they're so tiny you have to eat a lot of 'em.

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Nope, nope, nope.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Don't eat bees. Trust me; I learned that the hard way.
