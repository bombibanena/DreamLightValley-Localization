Ooh! {PlayerName}! I gotta talk to you! Me and Timon made a real neat discovery while we were lookin' at the night sky.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Fill me in on the wonders of the cosmos!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's talk about this later.

Well, we joined WALLÂ·E's Astronomy Club, 'cause we wanted to learn more about stars.

TAG: Pumbaa_006_f
And last night, we saw a giant BLUE star in the sky! Merlin says that it means there's gonna be a big meteor shower â one that hasn't happened in the Valley since you were real little!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh, wow. That's REALLY exciting!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
... What's a meteor shower?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Can you make wishes on meteors?

TAG: Pumbaa_008_f
Sure is! And we need to let the other members of the Astronomy Club know so they don't miss out!

TAG: Pumbaa_012_f
Could ya <Lore>make some pamphlets</Lore> about the shower and pass 'em out to the other members of the Astronomy Club? I don't want anyone to miss out!

TAG: Pumbaa_013_f
I don't know what a pamphlet is, but Merlin said you would.

TAG: Pumbaa_007_f
Timon says that's when part of the sky gets too busy, so a buncha the fireflies up there move to a new spot.

TAG: Pumbaa_011_f
I know it's not that. But I'm not sure what it is. I'd like to find out, though. And I bet other Astronomy Club members would too!

TAG: Pumbaa_009_f
I don't know, but let's try!

TAG: Pumbaa_010_f
I'm gonna wish to know what meteors REALLY are.

TAG: Pumbaa_004_f
Oh, okay. But don't take too long. Something important's gonna happen!
