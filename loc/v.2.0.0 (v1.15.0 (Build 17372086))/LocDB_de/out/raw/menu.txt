TAG: cutscene_Exp2Pres1
But when the Forgetting started, Maleficent and Hades stole the Vale away.

TAG: cutscene_Exp2Pres2
They agreed to rule over it together, splitting it right down the middle.

TAG: cutscene_Exp2Pres3
But soon... Maleficent and Hades began to argue.

TAG: cutscene_Exp2Pres4
Their feud tore the Vale asunder... and the Neverafter began.

TAG: cutscene_ExpPres1
During the Forgetting, I set out on a journey and discovered a land beyond the waters of Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: cutscene_ExpPres2
A land called... Eternity Isle.

TAG: cutscene_ExpPres3
A place filled with ancient relics that empower their wielder to control time...

TAG: cutscene_introbackstory_01
Dreamlight Valley used to be a cheerful place full of happy Villagers.

TAG: cutscene_introbackstory_02
Life was flourishing, thanks to our Ruler's magic.

TAG: cutscene_introbackstory_03
Until our Ruler vanished... and the Forgetting began.

TAG: cutscene_introbackstory_04
Our memories faded. The Valley became a shadow of itself...

TAG: cutscene_introbackstory_05
We tried to save our memories of the life that had been.

TAG: cutscene_introvideo_01
Our story begins with an ending, as you decide it's time to leave the city behind.

TAG: cutscene_introvideo_02
Yearning for a pause from life's responsibilities, you arrive at a familiar place.

TAG: cutscene_introvideo_03
A quick stroll along a nearby path leads you to a spot where, as a child, you found that life was simpler...

TAG: cutscene_introvideo_04
And with a touch of imagination, all your dreams would come true!

TAG: cutscene_introvideo_05
Finding the perfect place for a rest, you begin remembering these long-lost dreams...

TAG: cutscene_introvideo_06
And drift off to sleep.
