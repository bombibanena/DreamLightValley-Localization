How curious. A tiny Night Thorn plant?

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
It's adorable!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It kinda is...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That thing's a menace!

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
What an interesting result!

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Maybe a little more theory and a little less practice?

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
That's certainly something to consider.

It appears to be completely devoid of Dark Magic.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
This requires further study. I'll keep this in the lab for now.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Are you sure that's a good idea?

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Well, I have to continue my investigation. But I promise, I'll come to you first thing should anything get out of hand.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
And of course, we still have Merlin's potion should something go wrong.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Why, this might be just what I need to uncover the secret of magic here!

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}, for both your support of my scientific inquiries, and your help in dealing with that little situation.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Happy to help! Just... be more careful in the future, OK?

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
I'm not so sure about that...
