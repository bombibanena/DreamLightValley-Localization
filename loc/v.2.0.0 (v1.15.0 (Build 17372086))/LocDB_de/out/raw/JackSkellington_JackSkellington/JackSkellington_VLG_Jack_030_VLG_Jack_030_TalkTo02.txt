Ah, {PlayerName}... Were you able to find out everyone's thoughts on holidays?

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
Excellent... Well then, I know just what to do for her!

TAG: JackSkellington_031_f
Oh? What are you planning?

TAG: JackSkellington_032_f
It's a surprise! Both for her and you.

TAG: JackSkellington_033_f
Can I get a hint?

TAG: JackSkellington_034_f
Hmm...

TAG: JackSkellington_035_f
All I'll tell you is... People say that you eat with your eyes first, but that won't be true here...

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
How mysterious! What about the others?

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Well, I'll need your help for them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What do I need to do for Vanellope?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do I need to do for Scar?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What do I need to do for Olaf?

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Yep!

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Vanellope seems really intrigued by the idea of holiday-themed power-ups.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
And Scar really likes the idea of a holiday where subjects pay tribute to him.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Hmmm, yes, I have some ideas already...

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Olaf loves collecting trivia about his friends so he can give them the perfect gifts.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
And Minnie... surprisingly loves Halloween.

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
She does? Isn't she marvelous?!

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Ha, I thought you'd like that. Minnie says she loves a good fun fright.

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
I want to give her a special token of holiday game-time fun.

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
Could you make me a brightly colored <ActivityItem>Candy Skull</ActivityItem>? You'll need <ActivityItem>Sugarcane</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Vanilla</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fruit</ActivityItem>.

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
I'll <Lore>speak to Remy</Lore>. Making candy can get complicated!

TAG: JackSkellington_036_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. Now off you go â we have a holiday to plan!

TAG: JackSkellington_000_f
I have the perfect idea for Scar's surprise!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
We'll need some fresh vegetables.

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Could you grow <ActivityItem>Zucchini</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Potatoes</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Tomatoes</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Bell Peppers</ActivityItem> in the Forgotten Lands and bring them to me?

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Vegetables grown in the Forgotten Lands? That sounds ominous...

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Well, I've been taking soil samples from each of the Biomes, and there's some fascinating magic in the soil of the Forgotten Lands.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Scar strikes me as quite sophisticated, and I'm sure the soil of the Forgotten Lands will create exquisite vegetables.

TAG: JackSkellington_026_f
I want to help Olaf explore his joy of trivia by sharing some very special books with him.

TAG: JackSkellington_027_f
Could you gather <ActivityItem>Fiber</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Dark Wood</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem>?

TAG: JackSkellington_028_f
You'll need those to craft a <ActivityItem>Blank Book</ActivityItem>.

TAG: JackSkellington_029_f
Sure!
