{PlayerName} â how marvelous to see you again!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Likewise!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is it... chillingly wonderful?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Uhh... BOO!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Your arrival is quite fortuitous. I've something I'd love to discuss with you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What can I do for you, Jack?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Can we continue this later? In the middle of something.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
First, I must say that the House you've set up for me is absolutely splendid!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
But I recently went out to stretch my bones, see some of the Villagers, and investigate the Valley...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Sure, makes sense.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Do your bones stretch?

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Now remember: I have a scientific mind, and I become quite intrigued when I make discoveries.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
I've come to realize that it's been some time since I was last here.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
And I fear I may have made a few mistakes.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Oh no, what did you do?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'm sure it's fine!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
... Did you kidnap someone and bring them to Halloween Town?

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
It seems perhaps my curiosity got the better of me.

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
But I'm certain if you would introduce me around, all will be well!

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Sure! Let's <Lore>go see Olaf</Lore> â he's a great Villager to meet first.

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
You think so? Thank goodness!

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Perhaps you could reintroduce me to some of the Villagers?

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
No, no, nothing like that!

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Only in the figurative sense. Now...

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Oh, I do like your wordplay!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
A valiant attempt.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
But you'll have to try harder than that to scare me.
