{PlayerName}, I've recently been counting my blessings â it's something Minnie recommended as a way to start each day. And today, I thought about how terribly fun it is to be a skeleton!

I can hardly count the things I like about it.

You can take off your head!

You're so scary!

You're so agile!

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Yes! Very useful for a quick fright. Or to be sure the back of my skull is properly polished.

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Why thank you! That is my most cultivated skill.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
I am! Part of it is practice, but part of it comes from being so light.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Luckily, I don't bear the burden of muscles or organs.
