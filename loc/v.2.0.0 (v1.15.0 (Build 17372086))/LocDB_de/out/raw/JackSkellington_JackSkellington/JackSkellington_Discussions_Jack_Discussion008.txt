I am practicing my Shakespeare, {PlayerName}. Would you like to hear a bit?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Not now, thanks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Verily!

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
I recite chilling lines from various plays. Ahem â let me begin...

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
"IÂ couldÂ aÂ taleÂ unfoldÂ whoseÂ lightestÂ word<lw>WouldÂ harrowÂ upÂ thyÂ soul,<lw>FreezeÂ thyÂ youngÂ blood,

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
MakeÂ thyÂ twoÂ eyes,Â likeÂ stars,Â startÂ fromÂ their spheres<lw>ThyÂ knottedÂ andÂ combinedÂ locksÂ toÂ part,<lw>AndÂ eachÂ particularÂ hairÂ toÂ standÂ onÂ end,<lw>LikeÂ quillsÂ uponÂ theÂ fearfulÂ porpentine!"

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Cool, but I gotta run now.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Keep going!

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Fare thee well, {PlayerName}!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
"Double, double toil and trouble,<lw>Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.<lw>Fillet of a fenny snake,<lw>In the cauldron boil and bake.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Eye of newt and toe of frog,<lw>Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<lw>Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,<lw>Lizard's leg and owlet's wing!"

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
OK, that's enough for me.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
More!

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
"Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves!"

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
This is too scary for me â I'm out.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I love it!

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Well, I do focus on the most chilling of Shakespeare's quotations.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
And now I shall customize one for our dear Valley...

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
"Alas, poor Mickey!<lw>I knew him, {PlayerName}: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar?"

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
Alas! Alas!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
That was wonderful!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
That was weird.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Mickey's a ghost? Oh no!

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Thank you! You were a lovely audience.

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
Well, Shakespeare's not for everyone.

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Don't worry! It's only a story.

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Mickey's perfectly fine â you can check on him!
