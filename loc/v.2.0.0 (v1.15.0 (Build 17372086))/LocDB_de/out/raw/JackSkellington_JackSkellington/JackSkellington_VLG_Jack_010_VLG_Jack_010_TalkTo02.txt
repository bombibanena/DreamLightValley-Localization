Okay, Jack, we need to talk.

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Olaf was really upset after what you did to his ice cream.

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Ice cream? Oh, is that what it's called?

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Yeah, it's not cool to mess withâ

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
I wonder â is it related at all to the snow that I found in Christmas Town?

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Such a fascinating mix of chocolate and winter magic!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's not get distracted here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
As adorable as I find your fascination...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yeah, chocolate ice cream is pure magic.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
You need to ask people before doing something like that.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Olaf is such a sweetie. He totally would have given you a taste if you just asked nicely.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
You say he's sweet? And he's also made of snow? Hmm...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Let me stop you right there.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
His personality â not literally!

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Tampering with food â any food â is pretty rude. And putting your fingers in it is just unsanitary.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Ah, I see. I understand. My apologies, {PlayerName}.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
It was just so fascinating, I couldn't help myself!

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
It's OK; I know you don't mean any harm.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Who would you like to meet next?

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
Hmm, maybe someone with whom I would see more eye-to-eye?

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Someone who appreciates the power of fright!

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
Someone who finds joy in shadows...

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Oh, I know just who to see â I'll introduce you to Ursula!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
But still...
