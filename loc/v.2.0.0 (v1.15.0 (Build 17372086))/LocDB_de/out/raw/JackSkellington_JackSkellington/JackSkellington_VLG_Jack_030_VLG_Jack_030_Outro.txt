I finished the last of the holiday errands, Jack! Dreamlight Day's gonna be great!

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
Yes... yes... it will.

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
EE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That was... unnerving.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You have a... unique laugh.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
OK, now I'm worried.

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
Well, I have perfected my laugh to be as bone chilling as possible.

TAG: JackSkellington_023_f
Jack, your reactions are really starting to make me think that you have some kind of ulterior motive here.

TAG: JackSkellington_024_f
What are you really planning?

TAG: JackSkellington_025_f
A lovely Dreamlight Day for all! I promise!

TAG: JackSkellington_026_f
I'm quite certain everyone will enjoy my holiday surprises.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
OK, taking you at your word for now.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Fine... we'll see.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
That may be a stretch, but let's move on.

TAG: JackSkellington_027_f
What's next?

TAG: JackSkellington_028_f
We're almost done. I'll handle Minnie's surprise myself. Thank you for all your help!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Why, I'm even feeling nostalgic for when I last explored another holiday.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I hope Dreamlight Day goes well!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's concerning, given what happened last time.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Between our combined creativities and love for holidays...

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
We'll speak again on Dreamlight Day!

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Bye, Jack!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
I'm sure it'll be an experience the Village won't soon forget!

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
That... could be construed in a few ways.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Trust me, {PlayerName} â everything will go according to plan.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
I won't lose control of the holiday this time.

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
All right, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Besides, I still want to see how it turns out!

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
It will be wonderful â you'll see!

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
But I have finishing touches to attend to.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Do I need to put Dreamlight Day on hold?

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Not at all! I promise â no cursed Christmas presents.

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
That's very specific...

TAG: JackSkellington_034_f
Why, thank you.

TAG: JackSkellington_035_f
Whatever for?
