{PlayerName}, I've seen some very concerning signs around the Valley.

TAG: JackSkellington_039_f
Wait â what is that you're wearing?!

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
Oh, this old shirt?

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Yes, why am I seeing signs of my old nemesis everywhere?

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Well, you see, I'm the president of the Oogie Boogie Fan Club!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
WHAT?!

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
He arrived in the Valley yesterday, and everyone just loves him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He wants to meet with you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm going to try to encourage more insects to live here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why did you ever have beef with him?

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
I'm not surprised!

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Shall I go grab him now?

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
No, no, no. This is serious. I must have a plan...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh, come on!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
OK, I gotta come clean.

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
I heard he plans to get elected Prime Minister of Halloween Town.

TAG: JackSkellington_025_f
Oh... how kind of her! What a lovely way to welcome me to the Valley.

TAG: JackSkellington_026_f
Does that mean that Dreamlight Day was a success? Everyone loved their surprises?

TAG: JackSkellington_027_f
Well, not exactly...

TAG: JackSkellington_028_f
Not even Minnie?

TAG: JackSkellington_029_f
Well, Minnie loved hers.

TAG: JackSkellington_030_f
Everyone else was... not pleased.

TAG: JackSkellington_031_f
You gave people a solid fright! Don't you feel a little bad?

TAG: JackSkellington_032_f
For frightening them, of course not.

TAG: JackSkellington_033_f
I'm the Pumpkin King, {PlayerName}. Inspiring frightful chills is what I do!

TAG: JackSkellington_040_f
Well, watching over every resident of the Valley is what I do!

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
What?! But I'M the Pumpkin King!

TAG: JackSkellington_041_f
Maybe let's stick to scaring the people who really want to be scared, okay?

TAG: JackSkellington_042_f
Hmm... I suppose you're right. I wanted the Villagers to enjoy my frightful surprises. But it seems that being scared isn't for everyone here.

TAG: JackSkellington_034_f
However, since some do enjoy it, I already have ideas for next year's Dreamlight Day.

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Let's... put that on the back burner for now.

TAG: JackSkellington_000_f
Very well... Oh, you should take this, then. I suppose I don't need this element of my research anymore. And take this, too! A special surprise, just for you!

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Thanks, Jack!

TAG: JackSkellington_036_f
You can stick with Halloween â at least people will be expecting something scary from you then.

TAG: JackSkellington_037_f
Yes, yes... I can work with that!

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Did anyone actually vote for you?

TAG: JackSkellington_038_f
Beware, {PlayerName}... next Halloween, you'll experience a fright you won't soon forget!

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Holidays aren't a democracy, {PlayerName}! I am literally the essence of Halloween.

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
If Oogie Boogie takes over, it could permanently harm the holiday.

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
Jack... you need to relax. I'm joking.

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
Oogie Boogie isn't in the Valley â this is all a prank.

TAG: JackSkellington_023_f
... It is?

TAG: JackSkellington_024_f
Yeah! It was Minnie's idea. She wanted to give you a fright.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
But... but that will only make him stronger!

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Well, I do want to make him feel welcome...

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
A million reasons. Such as trying to kill Sandy Claws!

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Maybe that was just a big misunderstanding.
