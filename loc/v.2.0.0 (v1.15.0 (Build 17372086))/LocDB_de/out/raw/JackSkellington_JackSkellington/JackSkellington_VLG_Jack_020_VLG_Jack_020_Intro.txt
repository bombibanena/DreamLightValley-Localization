What's new?

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
{PlayerName}! I have big news. Could you give me a hand with something?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
As long as it's a figurative hand, sure!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'm both busy and need my hands.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Hmm? ... Oh! Ha-ha-ha! What an amusing joke. Now, I must tell you... Last night I awoke from a fitful sleep, ideas and theories whirling around my skull!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Do you want me to bring you some chamomile tea?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I didn't know skeletons slept.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What sort of ideas?

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Not at all â I'm fully energized with the possibility of discovery!

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
You mean the Vitalys Mines? Sure, I'll meet you in there! Careful you don't get lost. They're kind of... big.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
What do you want to discover?

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Well, the magic of this place intrigues me...

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
What is Dreamlight? And how does it relate to the holiday magic of Halloween Town?

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Big questions!

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
And I mean to answer them!

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
But I'm afraid my lab and instruments are back in Halloween Town.

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Could you help me get a new lab setup?

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
I found a marvelous cave under a waterfall. There's a room inside that would be just perfect for a laboratory.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Of course we do. Haven't you ever heard the expression "rest my weary bones"?

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Hmm, I guess I assumed that just applied to people with flesh over their bones.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
What's on your mind?

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Ideas of magic! Fellowship! And above all, holidays...

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
How interesting!
