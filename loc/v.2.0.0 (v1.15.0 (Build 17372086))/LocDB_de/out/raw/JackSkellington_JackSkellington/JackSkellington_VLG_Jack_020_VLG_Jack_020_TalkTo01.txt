What do you think of this place?

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
It's...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Too gloomy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Too isolated?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not frightening enough?

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
No... it's perfect!

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
I can already envision all the research I'll do here.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
My Christmas experiments will seem frivolous in comparison!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's great!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's... concerning.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
I have so many ideas, and I want to get to all of them quickly!

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
So what's next?

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Well... I'll need scientific instruments.

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Normally I'd borrow tools from Dr. Finkelstein, but that's not possible now.

TAG: JackSkellington_000_f
What about the stuff here? You've got flasks, a mortar and pestle, potions...

TAG: JackSkellington_001_f
Oh, I'll most certainly make good use of the equipment here!

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
But for the experiments I'm planning, I'll need equipment made to certain physical tolerances.

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
I wouldn't want anything exploding on me because I used the wrong type of glass container!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Coooooool.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'm starting to regret agreeing to this.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Well, I'm thankful this place is isolated.

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
Isn't it?

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Well, good thing I'm a crafting genius! What do you need?

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
Nothing particularly fancy â a standard array of flasks, burners, crucibles...

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Someone of your skill should be able to craft a <ActivityItem>Scientific Kit</ActivityItem> by using <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Coal</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Empty Vials</ActivityItem>.

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
Sure! Talk to you later.

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Brilliant! I'm off to see Merlin now â I hear he has a mind for magic, and I could use an expert's introduction to the arcane forces at work here.

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
Nonsense! I picked this spot for a reason!

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
Exactly why it appealed to me!

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
Oh no, there's no need to worry. This location is perfectly isolated. There's only a small chance of things escaping.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Great, let's try to lower that chance even more.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Oh I'm worrying.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
But let's try to be positive for now...
