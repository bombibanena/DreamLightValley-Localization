{PlayerName}! You're just in time!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
I've made a fantastic discovery! Why, this almost rivals when I first paired orange with black!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's hear it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't think I'm ready for something so momentous â I'll check back in later.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
There's something missing from the heart of Dreamlight Valley...

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
How ominous! What is it?

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
A holiday!

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Consider this... There's a clear connection between the Holiday forest and Dreamlight Valley...

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
But there's no holiday! It's what's been missing all along.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Hmm, that actually makes sense.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm not so sure about that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Do you have a corkboard full of notes and red yarn?

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
The evidence all points in the same direction.

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
I've dubbed the missing holiday "Dreamlight Day," and I want to bring it to life!

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Would you care to help me?

TAG: Player_002_f
That sounds...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...like a fun idea!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...dangerous, given your history.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
Excellent!

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Let's get it going â what do you need?

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
I need you to poll some of the Villagers. Ask them about their favorite holidays and what those holidays mean to them.

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
There are so many different people here that it stands to reason Dreamlight Day will be the sum of those parts.

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
I suggest you talk to <ActivityItem>Vanellope</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Scar</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Olaf</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Minnie</ActivityItem> for a cross-representative sample.

TAG: JackSkellington_023_f
Sure, on my way.

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
Oh {PlayerName}, that was a completely different situation.

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
I've learned my lesson about taking over other people's holidays.

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
This is more like... growing a new one from a seed.

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
All right... I guess it can't hurt. What do you need?

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Let me explain. I'm sure you'll be convinced.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
I don't follow. But I do use a chalk and blackboard.
