The Valley decorations are complete!

Excellent! But tell me, {PlayerName}...

...is everyone enjoying their Dreamlight Day gifts?

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Uhh, not sure. I haven't checked in with anyone since the start of Dreamlight Day.

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Well, I hope they're appreciating the work you put in.

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
As well as a special little something I mixed in for extra fun.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
That's... suspicious.

{PlayerName}, I've promised you: Everything will be fine!

And yet I'm still not sure.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I guess it could be all right...

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
Well, why don't you see for yourself?

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Okay, I'll go check in on everyone.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
But I'm not exactly convinced.
