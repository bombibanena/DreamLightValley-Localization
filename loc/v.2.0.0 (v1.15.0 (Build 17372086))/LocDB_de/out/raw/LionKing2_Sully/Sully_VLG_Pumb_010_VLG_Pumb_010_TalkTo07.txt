You don't need to say a word, {PlayerName}. Mike's up on all the Village gossip. He tells me you're looking for something to help Pumbaa clean his teeth.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Yeah... I was hoping you might have some spare toothpaste?

TAG: Sully_003_f
Sure do!

TAG: Sully_004_f
Gotta warn you though... Monster toothpaste is a little different. This one is "Praying Mint-is" flavor. Sort of a bug-spearmint combo.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Like "Praying Mantis" but with mint!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's a bug-flavored toothpaste?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
... Ew.

TAG: Sully_006_f
Ha, you got it! Hope that's not a problem.

TAG: Sully_005_f
That's actually perfect for Pumbaa.

TAG: Sully_008_f
You can <Lore>check around my House for the toothpaste</Lore>. It's in there somewhere!

TAG: Sully_007_f
Hey, I heard you humans have some pretty interesting flavors too. Like bubblegum? Cinnamon? Ugh. Just the thought makes my fur stand on end.
