{PlayerName}, am I glad to see you! We need to talk about Scar!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I was just coming to talk about him!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh no... What did he do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did he try to eat you?!

TAG: Remy_003_f
Then, you've got great timing.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Scar has been a TERRIBLE customer in the restaurant lately.

TAG: Remy_006_f
He keeps ordering a dish, eating most of it, and then sending the last bite back saying it was no good.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Unacceptable behavior!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Did you talk to him?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Isn't it "the customer is always right"?

TAG: Remy_008_f
That's not even the worst part!

TAG: Remy_011_f
I tried to talk to him. I told him I don't mind cooking food for him â everyone needs to eat! But complaining just so you don't have to pay is pretty rude.

TAG: Remy_012_f
His exact words were, "And what will a mere rodent like you do against a mighty king?"

TAG: Remy_013_f
Then he knocked his plate onto the floor. It shattered, and he left.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'll report this back to Mushu.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Scar knows how to make an exit!

TAG: Remy_015_f
He was worried Scar was picking on smaller Villagers.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Don't worry, Remy. We'll find a way to get Scar to stop this.

TAG: Remy_014_f
*sigh* Tell that to my dishes.

TAG: Remy_007_f
The first couple of times I didn't do anything... but the fifth time it happened?

TAG: Remy_009_f
Sure. But the full quote is: "The customer is always right in matters of taste."

TAG: Remy_010_f
And I'm pretty sure Scar liked the taste of the food plenty... He just didn't want to pay.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Nothing truly evil, but...

TAG: Remy_004_f
What? No. No... You scared him off of that, I think.
