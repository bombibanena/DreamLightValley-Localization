I noticed there are so many people around Dreamlight Valley with feet.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
And..?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
You wouldn't happen to know if any wish to have tails instead?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Everyone seems happy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What kind of tails?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're up to something...

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Yes. That's what I thought, too. How very disappointing.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Too bad... I could make them an offer they can't refuse! Hah!

TAG: Ursula_011_f
I think you should avoid messing with people's legs or tails, Ursula.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Oh, you're no fun.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Oh, whatever they'd like... fish, shark, perhaps something in the eel family.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
I could do it all! For the right price, of course.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Ugh, no trust at all!

TAG: Ursula_010_f
I'm always very honest about the pros and cons in my contracts, you know.
