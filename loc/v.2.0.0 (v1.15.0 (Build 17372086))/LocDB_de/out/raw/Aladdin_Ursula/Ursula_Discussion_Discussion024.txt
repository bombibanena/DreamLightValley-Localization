I have news. I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Oh really?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Yes! I only want to do good deeds from now on!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's wonderful!

I'm glad I'm having a positive influence on you!

If it isn't broke, don't fit it! HA!

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Oh, but I'm already a good friend!

TAG: Ursula_013_f
I'm always around to help out... I just ask a little payment in return.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Excuse me! I never STEAL anything!

TAG: Ursula_014_f
My dealings are always fair.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Well, that isn't very nice, is it?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
