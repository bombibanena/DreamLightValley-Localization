Well well, look what the Beast dragged in.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Or did he tell you to leave him alone? I'm certain I heard the sound of a childish tantrum coming from his general direction.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can't you just... be cool for once?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You really upset him, Mother Gothel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You need to be more compassionate around the other Villagers.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
You sound like my ungrateful daughter, accusing me of being cold.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Please, I'm just trying to sort this out.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
What did you say to Belle to make her upset in the first place?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Nothing really. She's just SO sensitive.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
We were discussing literature, and she was telling me about her favorite fables...

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
I merely suggested that we discuss it further once she broadens her horizons.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That doesn't sound too bad...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Is that really what you said?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Please give me the exact words.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
I certainly didn't think so.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
What did you say, precisely?

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Well, I believe I mentioned that her literary interests were... hmm... What word did I use? Oh, yes. Provincial.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Oh boy...

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
I also may have said that no one would be friends with someone who had such pedestrian taste in books.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Mother Gothel! That's horrible!

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Her tastes are horrible, aren't they?

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Ugh, never mind. I need to talk to the Beast.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
Tell Belle I'm always here for self-improvement advice!

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
In summary, yes.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
Well, that was my intent.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
After all, he needs to learn self-control.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
I was simply helping.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
I don't "need" to do anything, dear.
