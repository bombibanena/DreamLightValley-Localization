Why, {PlayerName}, have you brought me a gift?

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Think of it as a little something from the Beast and me. Go on and take a look.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
... Something on your mind, Mother Gothel?

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Hm? No. Nothing at all.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think you're lying.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You haven't been... reflecting on anything?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Really, dear. Now why would you say that?

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Perhaps something has caused you to see yourself in a new light?

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Ugh! You're behind the enchantment on that mirror, aren't you? What a horrific illusion you placed within it...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
It's a Mirror of True Seeing. Whatever you saw in it... is already deep within you.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Impossible. You're lying.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
I'm not.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
I refuse to believe you. And I refuse to look at that... that thing a moment longer. If I promise never to bother with Belle again, will you get rid of that hideous mirror and leave me be?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You have to promise.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think that could work.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
You swear you're going to leave the Beast and Belle alone now?

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
*SIGH* Yes. But only if you stop with that awful enchantment...

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
I'll move the mirror. But if you don't keep your word... I'll put it back.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
I never want to see that hideous illusion again. I promise that I will leave Belle and the Beast be. Since they OBVIOUSLY can't handle a little teasing...

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
Had I known the Beast was capable of such subterfuge, I would have been more careful. I'm... almost impressed.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Well, I'll let you mull over that revelation. Bye for now â be good!

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
No, I... Wait. Reflecting?
