Oh please. Don't tell me you plan to chastise me yet again.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Oh no, this is just a simple gift.

I helped the Beast bring some roses back from his Realm, and he wants to share them with the Valley.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Well... I suppose that is relatively harmless.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
It's not my preferred form of enchanted flower...

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
But it is rather pretty.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Consider it a peace offering. The Beast hopes that this will mark a new period of... let's say, relative calm between you two.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
... Very well, I'll play nice.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Excellent.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Ouch! He left the thorns on!

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Yes, the Beast was hoping you would pick up on that.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
He hopes that things between you two can be civilized. But if not... he'll defend those he cares about.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
I... Please tell him that we have an understanding.

Are you planning on attacking me with enchanted mirrors once more?
