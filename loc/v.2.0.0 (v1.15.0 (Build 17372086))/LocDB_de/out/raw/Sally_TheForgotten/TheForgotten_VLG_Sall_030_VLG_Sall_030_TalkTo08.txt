Let me guess: You want a food memory from me for your party with Sally and the Fairy Godmother.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah! Care to share?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you psychic?

I guess one of my good food memories is you cooking <Lore>Bouillabaisse</Lore>.

After the awful one I â you... we? â cooked for Goofy... there was nothing as delicious as the fresh kind.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Thanks! I'll add that to my list.

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
Thanks for including me, {PlayerName}.

Ha. No... I'm still getting used to my own thoughts, let alone everyone else's.

I hear things from the ravens...

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
Okay, fine. Sally told me.
