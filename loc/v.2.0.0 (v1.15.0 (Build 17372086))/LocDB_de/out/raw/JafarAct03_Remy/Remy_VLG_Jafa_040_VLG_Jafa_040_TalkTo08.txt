How you holding up, Remy?

TAG: Remy_002_f
I'm doin' just fine, {PlayerName}. I should be asking you the same thing!

TAG: Remy_003_f
Everyone at Chez Remy's been talking about Jafar. I don't envy you your job right now.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Yeah, it's rough. We've never had to exile anyone from the community, but what if it comes to that during the trial?

TAG: Remy_005_f
I'd like to be pleasantly surprised by Jafar, but his prior actions haven't really done much to inspire hope.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Hmm, what if we bring food into the equation?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Go on...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Of course you'd suggest something involving food.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Well, I can't help but think back to when I first had to cook for Anton Ego.

TAG: Remy_010_f
I was so scared of him, the power he wielded, the mean-spirited part of him that always seemed to float on the surface.

TAG: Remy_011_f
But he really changed, and all he needed was to be reminded of a better time.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Hmm, do you think Jafar could have the same path?

TAG: Remy_013_f
Your guess is as good as mine, but it's worth a shot! What do we know about Jafar's past, anyway?

TAG: Remy_014_f
Hmm, basically nothing. That's a good point; thanks, Remy.

TAG: Remy_015_f
I think I'll use this idea as part of a sentence if we need something lighter than exile.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Hey, stick with what you know!

TAG: Remy_009_f
But, I can't help thinking back to when I first had to cook for Anton Ego in Paris.
