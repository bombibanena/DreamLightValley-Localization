Hey {PlayerName}, will you help me settle an argument with Goofy and prove that I'm right?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What's the argument about?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm staying out of this for now.

TAG: Donald_016_f
Goofy says he once caught a catfish in a lake.

TAG: Donald_017_f
But there aren't any catfish in lakes!

TAG: Donald_000_f
Goofy doesn't know what he's talking about!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He doesn't know as much as you, that's for sure.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Goofy's kind of goofy, but he's knowledgeable about lots of things.

TAG: Donald_002_f
Exactly! He doesn't know anything about fish if he thinks catfish live in lakes.

TAG: Donald_006_f
Everyone knows catfish are from the ocean!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Yeah, catfish are ocean fish.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I think catfish are lake fish.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Catfish are native to the supermarket.

TAG: Donald_007_f
Just like I said! But now we have to prove that to Goofy.

TAG: Donald_011_f
We're going to the ocean to catch some catfish!

TAG: Donald_012_f
And you better look like a real fisherperson.

TAG: Donald_013_f
If we catch a real catfish, it'll splash all over. You don't want to get wet. Here, put these waders on.

TAG: Donald_008_f
What?! Grr... Now I have to prove you AND Goofy wrong.

TAG: Donald_009_f
Ha-ha! Very funny.

TAG: Donald_003_f
I don't know about that...

TAG: Donald_005_f
But if he thinks catfish live in lakes, he definitely doesn't know anything about fish!

TAG: Donald_004_f
Fine, but he's just gonna keep thinking he's right unless you come back and prove that I'm right. And that's not right!
