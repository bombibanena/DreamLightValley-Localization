Another <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Donald_001_f
But this one looks different. And it's locked up tight. Whatever's in here must be super important.

TAG: Donald_005_f
I'll try bashing it against a rock for a while...

TAG: Donald_002_f
Thanks for your help, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Donald_003_f
Wait. We never did manage to find a catfish in the ocean.

TAG: Donald_004_f
Oh...

TAG: Donald_007_f
Aw phooey. Maybe Goofy was right after all.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You should apologize.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's just forget this whole argument.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Never let him find out you were wrong.

TAG: Donald_008_f
You're right.

TAG: Donald_006_f
Thanks for helping me, {PlayerName}. I'll tell Goofy I'm sorry.

TAG: Donald_013_f
And I'll let you know when I figure out how to open this Time Capsule...

TAG: Donald_009_f
Yeah, I bet Goofy will forget I ever said anything about catfish.

TAG: Donald_010_f
Thanks for the advice, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Donald_011_f
Yeah, I'll keep telling him catfish are from the ocean. He'll probably spend a whole summer trying to catch one. Heh-heh-heh.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I always have more fun when you're around.
