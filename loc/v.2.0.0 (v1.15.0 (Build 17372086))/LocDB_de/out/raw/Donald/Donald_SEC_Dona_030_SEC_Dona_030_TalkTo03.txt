I saw that blue alien hop out of his spaceship. I remember him from before the Forgetting!

TAG: Donald_001_f
His name is Stitch. And he loves to cause trouble.

TAG: Donald_014_f
But I think the Forgetting made him even more trouble than before.

TAG: Donald_002_f
Do you know what this means, Donald? You were right all along. There WAS a space alien stealing everybody's socks!

TAG: Donald_003_f
I knew it!

TAG: Donald_004_f
And nobody believed me! I was the only one who had it figured out!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Now you can brag about it to everyone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think we have more important things to worry about.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Don't let it go to your head.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Ha! I can't wait to show Uncle Scrooge that I was right.

TAG: Donald_008_f
I'd hold off on bragging to Mr. McDuck until we know for sure that Stitch isn't going to destroy all the most valuable property in the Village.

TAG: Donald_006_f
Aw, I guess you're right. But we can't have Stitch running around the Village destroying stuff.

TAG: Donald_010_f
We gotta catch him... but how?

TAG: Donald_011_f
Well, his spaceship got destroyed. I guess that was his only place to live. He seemed pretty mad about it.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Maybe we can start by <Lore>asking your Uncle Scrooge to make a home for him</Lore>.

TAG: Donald_013_f
That's a good idea. That way, Stitch can wreck his own House instead of mine.

TAG: Donald_007_f
Aw, don't worry, {PlayerName}. You know me. I'm very humble.

TAG: Donald_009_f
Good. Then you won't be too busy bragging to help me with Stitch.
