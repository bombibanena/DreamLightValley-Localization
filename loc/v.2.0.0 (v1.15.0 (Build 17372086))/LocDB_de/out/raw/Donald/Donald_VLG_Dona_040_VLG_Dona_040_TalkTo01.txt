We did it! We found my instructions for building the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fountain</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This is going to make the Forgotten Lands look so nice!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You'll finally be able to finish your project!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This better be the last thing you hid...

TAG: Donald_007_f
Yeah, once we're done with it, it'll be the nicest place in the Village.

TAG: Donald_011_f
What do we have to do to build this thing?

TAG: Donald_001_f
We need to get everything I wrote down here...

TAG: Donald_005_f
<ActivityItem>Stones</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Soil</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Donald_006_f
Plus all the parts of the fountain that I buried before.

TAG: Donald_003_f
Here, take the <ActivityItem>Water Pump</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Basins</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Turbine</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Distributors</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Donald_004_f
When you have everything else, craft the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fountain</ActivityItem> and meet me back in the Forgotten Lands. I've got more planning to do.

TAG: Donald_008_f
Then I can start thinking of other super-genius ways to make the Village better!

TAG: Donald_009_f
I promise it's the last thing I buried.

TAG: Donald_010_f
At least... the last thing I remember burying. Heh-heh-heh.
