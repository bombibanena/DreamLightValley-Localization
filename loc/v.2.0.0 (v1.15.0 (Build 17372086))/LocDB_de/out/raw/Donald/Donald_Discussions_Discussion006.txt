Oh boy. My Uncle Scrooge is already here in the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You don't sound thrilled.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's been very helpful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's kind of greedy.

TAG: Donald_001_f
Well, Uncle Scrooge and I don't always agree on things.

TAG: Donald_002_f
But he's my family, and you know what that means.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
You have to stick together.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Friends are more important.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
No, I don't.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Yep! He's always there for me when I need him.

TAG: Donald_006_f
And I'll always be there for him.

TAG: Donald_007_f
It's not a competition. My friends AND my family are both important to me.

TAG: Donald_008_f
Well, family's important to me. They're not always perfect, but we always stick together.

TAG: Donald_003_f
That's great. But I'd be surprised if he helped you do anything for free.

TAG: Donald_004_f
I'm not sure about that. But he does love his money. He even has a special display case for the first dime he earned!
