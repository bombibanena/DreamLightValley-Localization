Huh? What is it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think it's some sort of extraterrestrial technology.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's just some broken junk.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I have no idea what it is.

TAG: Donald_017_f
HA! That proves it. We've got ourselves a whole bunch of sock-stealing space aliens.

TAG: Donald_010_f
I think it means that this thing belongs to whatever chewed on your sock.

TAG: Donald_011_f
And maybe if we could just find a couple more DNA samples... it would power up this weird device.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Smart thinkin', {PlayerName}. Maybe that will lead us right to the sock thieves...

TAG: Donald_013_f
...and prove to everybody around here that I was right!

TAG: Donald_014_f
I'll <Lore>keep an eye out for any more missing socks</Lore> or lights in the sky.

TAG: Donald_015_f
I'll keep this doohickey for now... and go wash this sock.

TAG: Donald_016_f
(Why would somebody chew on a sock? This is disgusting...)

TAG: Donald_002_f
They must've dropped it when they were stealing my stuff.

TAG: Donald_003_f
WAAAAAK! It's making a beeping sound!

TAG: Donald_005_f
Wait a minute... it's beepin' louder when I put it near my sock...

TAG: Donald_006_f
Did ya see that? When the drool from the sock fell on that doohickey, it lit up.

TAG: Donald_007_f
Hm. It says something on the screen...

TAG: Donald_008_f
<Lore>"DNA MATCH. AUTHORIZATION 33% COMPLETE."</Lore>

TAG: Donald_009_f
What does that mean? This is preposterous!

TAG: Donald_018_f
Junk?! Look at it. It obviously came from a space alien's ship.

TAG: Donald_019_f
I'll tell ya what it is. It's proof that we've got a bunch of sock-stealing space aliens in the Village.
