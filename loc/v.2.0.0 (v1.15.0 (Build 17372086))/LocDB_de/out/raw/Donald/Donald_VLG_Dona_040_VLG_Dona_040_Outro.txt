The Forgotten Lands look MUCH better now. Thanks for your help, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No! Thank YOU, Donald!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It was your plan. Don't forget that.

I gotta do everything around here.

TAG: Donald_001_f
Aww, it was my pleasure.

TAG: Donald_003_f
Mine too.

Since I'm such a great friend, I got you a present to thank YOU for being such a great friend too, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Donald_004_f
It sure was. A super-genius one!
