What's that? Another clue?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's animal fur.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's space alien fur.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's unidentified creature fur.

TAG: Donald_002_f
Maybe one of the raccoons around Dreamlight Valley is getting into people's houses.

TAG: Donald_014_f
WAK! It's making even less sense than it did before!

TAG: Donald_015_f
I think it means that fur came from whatever is stealing everybody's socks.

TAG: Donald_016_f
And that we might only need to find one more clue to make it go to 100%...

TAG: Donald_017_f
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! That'll be easy!

TAG: Donald_018_f
I'll <Lore>keep my eyes out for any more clues</Lore>.

TAG: Donald_003_f
It would make a lot more sense than space aliens.

TAG: Donald_004_f
Don't be ridiculous! What kind of raccoon steals just half of everybody's socks? And that fur is blue!

TAG: Donald_007_f
Besides, remember that funny doohickey we found in my House? That didn't come from any raccoon!

TAG: Donald_009_f
Hey, I just got an idea!

TAG: Donald_011_f
The doohickey started beeping again! Let's see what happens when we put the fur inside it...

TAG: Donald_012_f
Did ya see that? It started flashing again! What does it say?

TAG: Donald_013_f
It says... <Lore>"DNA MATCH. AUTHORIZATION 66% COMPLETE."</Lore>

TAG: Donald_005_f
You were right, Donald. There's no mistaking it.

TAG: Donald_006_f
It's blue. This fur must have come from some sort of space alien.

TAG: Donald_008_f
Oh boy! This is the best piece of evidence yet. Even better than that funny doohickey we found in my House.

TAG: Donald_010_f
It could be from a space alien. But it could also be from a raccoon or something.
