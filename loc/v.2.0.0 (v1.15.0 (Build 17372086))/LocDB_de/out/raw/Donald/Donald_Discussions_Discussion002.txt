My friends always say I have a bit of a temper, but I don't know what they're talking about.

What do YOU do when you're really mad? Not that I'm asking for any particular reason...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I meditate to try to calm down.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I punch a pillow.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I yell and flail around.

TAG: Donald_002_f
Meditate? How do you do that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Close your eyes and breathe deeply... in... out...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Stand on your head and spin for three minutes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I just listen to music to zone out.

TAG: Donald_006_f
... ... ... zzzzzzzzzzz...

TAG: Donald_007_f
Oh, I knew that!

TAG: Donald_008_f
I'll try that!

TAG: Donald_003_f
That sounds pretty useful. I'm gonna write that down.

TAG: Donald_004_f
But NOT because I'll ever need to do it!

TAG: Donald_005_f
So do I! Wait, are you making fun of me?!
