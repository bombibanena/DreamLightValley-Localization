<ActivityItem>Tuna</ActivityItem>! Finally! I've been trying to catch some all day.

TAG: Donald_002_f
But all I catch are horrible fish that glow!

TAG: Donald_003_f
Not only that, they wriggle right out of my hand and disappear!

When I find whoever's doing this, I'm gonna give 'em a piece of my mind.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Don't worry. We're going to fix this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Deep breaths. Stay calm.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Somebody better fix it! I can't do anything with disappearing fish!

TAG: Donald_006_f
WAAAAKKK! Don't tell me to stay calm!
