Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! I'm back in the Valley! Thank you for your help, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Donald_008_f
It was pretty brave to go to the Dark Grove and help me. I bet nothing scares you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You kidding? I'm a fraidy-cat!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're right. I'm the bravest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I get scared, but I don't let it stop me.

TAG: Donald_009_f
Really? Don't tell anybody, but sometimes I am too.

TAG: Donald_004_f
Wow! Things sure have changed here.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
One more Pillar fixed!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
There's still a lot of work ahead.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The Night Thorns always come back...

TAG: Donald_005_f
Aw phooey! Are they all broken like this?

TAG: Donald_007_f
We have to figure out who the Dark Entity is so we can get rid of all these Night Thorns and fix the Village for good!

TAG: Donald_013_f
I think I know who the Dark Entity might be. Ursula told me about a being called the Forgotten.

TAG: Donald_014_f
The Forgotten!

TAG: Donald_015_f
Never heard of 'em.

TAG: Donald_016_f
But if they started this whole mess, we have to stop 'em!

TAG: Donald_017_f
Easier said than done.

TAG: Donald_001_f
WAK! I just remembered! While I was lost in that scary forest, the Dark Entity dropped something. It looks like a page from a diary...

TAG: Donald_002_f
Here, take it. I don't understand it, but maybe you can find out more about the Dark Entity if you figure it out.

TAG: Donald_012_f
Time to go see my friends. Thanks again for helping me, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Donald_006_f
Yeah, but the Village already looks a lot better! You're doing great!

TAG: Donald_003_f
I bet the Dark Entity we saw has something to do with this...

TAG: Donald_010_f
And modest too. Heh-heh-heh.

TAG: Donald_011_f
You mean you're not even scared of being scared? That's ridiculous... but brave too.
