What's the big idea?! Look at my boat! It's a WRECK!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Uhh... I'm backing away slowly...

TAG: Donald_002_f
FINALLY! It's about time somebody cares about MY problems!

TAG: Donald_003_f
I went into the forest to protect the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Donald_004_f
And no one even remembered to take care of my House!

TAG: Donald_005_f
How would you feel if that happened to you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'd be pretty mad!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
I'd be really sad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I wouldn't care.

TAG: Donald_007_f
You bet you would! This is infuriating!

TAG: Donald_010_f
Where am I supposed to live now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
Can we fix the houseboat?

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
Is there anyone you can ask for help?

TAG: Donald_011_f
*sigh* Maybe. But not with the tools I have. I need better stuff.

TAG: Donald_014_f
Hey, maybe my Uncle Scrooge can help.

TAG: Donald_015_f
He's so rich he has one of everything. We should ask him for help.

TAG: Donald_001_f
Okay. I'll go talk to your Uncle Scrooge and see about getting you some tools!

TAG: Donald_012_f
Hmm... Maybe my Uncle Scrooge. He'd have everything I need.

TAG: Donald_013_f
Of course, he'll probably charge me.

TAG: Donald_008_f
Sad? I'm not sad. I'm infuriated!

TAG: Donald_009_f
Well, I do care! I'm infuriated!

TAG: Donald_006_f
Fine. Do what you want. But come back when you're ready to help me!
