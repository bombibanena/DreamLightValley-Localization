What does that mean?

TAG: Donald_010_f
I think it means this thing is some kind of <ActivityItem>Homing Beacon</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Donald_015_f
We need to put this down somewhere, and then the alien spaceship will land.

TAG: Donald_011_f
And then we can catch the sock-stealing space aliens! Smart thinking, {PlayerName}.

Now no one will doubt me the next time I see something suspicious going on around here.

TAG: Donald_014_f

Do you still have that <ActivityItem>Strange Device</ActivityItem>?
