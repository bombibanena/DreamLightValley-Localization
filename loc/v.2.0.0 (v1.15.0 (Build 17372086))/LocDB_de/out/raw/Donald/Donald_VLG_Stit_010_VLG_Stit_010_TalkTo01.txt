Hey Donald, I found a sign with a picture of you in the Peaceful Meadow. But it looks like someone drew on it...

TAG: Donald_000_f
WAK! What's the big idea?! Who wouldâ Oh, I know who it was...

TAG: Donald_002_f
It was Stitch! If he does that again... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... WAAAAAAAKKKK!!!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's wrong? How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe I should just stay out of this.

TAG: Donald_003_f
Calm down?! Why should I calm down?!

TAG: Donald_004_f
Every time I turn around, Stitch wrecks something else.

TAG: Donald_007_f
What did Stitch do to get you so riled up?

TAG: Donald_008_f
First, he won't stop bothering me. Leaving teeth marks in my pontoon, stealing the worms out of my tackle box...

TAG: Donald_009_f
And then he asked me if I was ugly as a duckling!

TAG: Donald_010_f
I think you might have misunderstood Stitch. See, one of his favorite stories is the Ugly Duckling...

TAG: Donald_011_f
I didn't misunderstand anything! He's got it in for me.

TAG: Donald_012_f
So I put up those signs around the Village to tell Stitch to keep out of my favorite places.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Smart idea. Good fences make good neighbors.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's not nice. The Village is for everyone.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Did Stitch obey the signs?

TAG: Donald_013_f
Exactly! That way, we won't have any more misunderstandings.

TAG: Donald_014_f
But did Stitch follow the signs? No! Not once! Not ever!

TAG: Donald_018_f
But that's not all. He drew funny pictures all over 'em.

TAG: Donald_019_f
Maybe I can <Lore>talk to Stitch</Lore> and try to teach him to respect your property.

TAG: Donald_020_f
THANK YOU!

TAG: Donald_021_f
If Stitch doesn't leave me alone, I'm gonna fix up that spaceship of his and send him to the moon.

TAG: Donald_015_f
Exactly! And I like sharing the Village with everybody who behaves. But Stitch doesn't behave!

TAG: Donald_016_f
He won't even follow the signs.

TAG: Donald_017_f
Of course not! He didn't follow any of them.

TAG: Donald_005_f
Finally! Somebody around here wants to help me for a change.

TAG: Donald_006_f
I keep telling everybody we have a Stitch problem, but does anybody listen? No!

TAG: Donald_001_f
Stay out of it?! You can't! I need your help.
