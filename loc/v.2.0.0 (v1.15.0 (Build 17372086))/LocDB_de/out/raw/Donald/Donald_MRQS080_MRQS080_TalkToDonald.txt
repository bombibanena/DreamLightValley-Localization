Finally! What took you so long?!

TAG: Donald_013_f
Wait... you're not Kristoff!

TAG: Donald_012_f
Are you trying to steal the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem> from me?

TAG: Player_002_f
Wait, I'm {PlayerName}...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Kristoff sent me!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Merlin helped me find you.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm here to help you!

TAG: Donald_001_f
Kristoff's still in the Valley? He should be here helping me!

TAG: Donald_002_f
I took all the risk following the Dark Entity to get the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem> back!

TAG: Donald_003_f
And I've been stuck in this place ever since!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
What is this place?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Did you find the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Are you okay?

TAG: Player_004_choice_004_f
Let's get out of here!

TAG: Donald_005_f
No idea. It looks like the Valley... but much darker and scarier!

TAG: Donald_006_f
I saw a <Lore>Dark Castle</Lore> through the trees... But I have no idea who lives there.

TAG: Donald_022_f
Of course I did! I followed the Dark Entity, but then I got lost in all the fog.

TAG: Donald_008_f
They opened another portal and dropped the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> when they left!

TAG: Donald_009_f
I picked it up, but I couldn't find my way back. I thought Kristoff would've sent help sooner than this!

TAG: Donald_010_f
Here, take the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem>. Since you made it here, I bet you can go back to the Valley and fix the <ActivityItem>Pillar of Courage</ActivityItem> with your magic.

TAG: Donald_007_f
Do I look okay?! I've been lost in a dark, scary forest for I don't know how long!

TAG: Donald_014_f
Sorry... It's not your fault. Actually, I feel better now that you're here. Hey, maybe you can get me out!

TAG: Donald_021_f
Phew! That's all I want!

TAG: Donald_011_f
You gotta go back through the portal and fix the Pillar. Then, focus your thoughts, and its power should be strong enough to bring me back to the Valley.

TAG: Donald_004_f
Merlin! I should've known he'd be tangled up in this mess.

TAG: Donald_016_f
Then you know about the Forgetting. Kristoff and I were trying to stop it, but then the Dark Entity showed up and stole the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem>...
