Okay... I'm a bit confused.

TAG: Anna_001_f
{PlayerName}, why are you giving me <ActivityItem>Broken Table Pieces</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Anna_002_f
Oh, wait! Is that the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_000_f
Yes! But it's broken, and I want to fix it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...to make Mirabel happy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...to honor your friendship with Mirabel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...to throw a fun party.

TAG: Anna_003_f
That's such a great idea! Mirabel is so nice. You're right; we need to do that for her.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Oh, I know! I'll ask Kristoff and Elsa to help us fix the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem> as a gift for Mirabel.

TAG: Anna_005_f
Kristoff can help repair it, and we can make some new chairs.

TAG: Anna_006_f
And maybe Elsa can use her powers to decorate the wood.

TAG: Anna_007_f
It'll be fun! And then we can throw a party to celebrate our friendship!

TAG: Anna_008_f
Oh! But what about Moana? She always used to help us with these parties.

TAG: Anna_009_f
I talked to her. She's making a brand-new tablecloth using an old sail.

TAG: Anna_010_f
And I'll take care of the food. I'm thinking <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem> to celebrate Mirabel and a <ActivityItem>Large Seafood Plate</ActivityItem> for Moana.

TAG: Anna_011_f
Is there anything you and Elsa like to eat?

TAG: Anna_012_f
Chocolate! Definitely chocolate. Maybe you could make some <ActivityItem>Chocolate Chip Cookies</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Anna_013_f
Remy introduced us to them, and they're amazing! He gave me a <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem> in case I wanted to make them myself. Here, you can borrow it.

TAG: Anna_014_f
Now, I'll go work on the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>. It'll probably take us a day to fix it.

TAG: Anna_015_f
I'll talk to Moana. Don't worry.

TAG: Anna_016_f
And I'll take care of the food. I'm thinking <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem> to celebrate Mirabel. Is there any food you'd like to eat?

TAG: Anna_017_f
Oh, that's so nice of you! And I have to help.

TAG: Anna_018_f
Well, you came to the right place. Mirabel, Moana, Elsa and I used to have so much fun together. I'd love for it to be like that again.
