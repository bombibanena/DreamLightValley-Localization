{PlayerName}, I have some knowledge of intergalactic travel.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
But I wonder if I should learn more about traveling the seas so I can look out for dangers in the waters around the Valley.

What do you know about ships of a more... nautical nature?

TAG: Player_000_f
Hmm. Well, you'll need a boat like Moana's and...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...a sail.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...some oars to row it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...a motor.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Harnessing the power of the wind? Right.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
But considering I'm a foot tall, I'm not sure I'd be able to steer properly if the winds get too powerful.

I'll have to search for a toy-sized solution to this challenge.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Row? With my arms?

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Considering I'm a foot tall, I'm not sure I could wield a big enough oar to move a boat like that.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
A gasoline-powered combustion engine?

TAG: Buzz_006_f
That's a bit old-fashioned, and considering I'm a foot tall, I'm not sure I could control it.
