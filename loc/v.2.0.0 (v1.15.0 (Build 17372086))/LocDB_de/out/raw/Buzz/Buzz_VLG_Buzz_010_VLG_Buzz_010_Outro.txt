{PlayerName}, you look ready to take on any threat to the galaxy. Do you feel as heroic as you look?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes, I really feel like I'm part of Star Command.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No, but I sure feel stylish.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I look ridiculous!!!

TAG: Buzz_011_f
That's because you are, cadet. At least the version of it we're creating here.

Thanks to your enrollment, there's someone to hold down the command post while I go on my first patrol. I'll let you know if I encounter anything suspicious.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
And you look stylish too, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_000_f
Ah, cadet! I heard Scrooge McDuck gave you your <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Uniform</ActivityItem> and...

TAG: Buzz_009_f
You're not wearing it...

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Why aren't you wearing it?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm worried I'm going to dirty it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm sorry; I forgot to put it on.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I don't like uniforms.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
Oh, don't worry, {PlayerName}. Getting your <ActivityItem>Uniform</ActivityItem> dirty is part of the fun. Now...

TAG: Buzz_015_f
That's okay, {PlayerName}. We'll just pretend that there was a surprise attack, and you're wearing your space pajamas. Now...

TAG: Buzz_016_f
It does take some getting used to. But I've been wearing my uniform for... well, forever.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
And I can promise you... it's surprisingly comfortable. I think it'll grow on you. Now...
