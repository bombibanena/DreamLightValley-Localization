Fascinating.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
I remember this.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
I was locked in combat with this Scar fellow.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Hey! No combat in the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why were you fighting?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I should have known Scar would be up to no good.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Well, he must have started it. But I can't remember why...

TAG: Player_001_f
Let's go see Scar. I'm sure you two can...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...be friends.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...be civil.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...at least learn to avoid each other.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Well, when I first met Woody, I didn't think we'd ever get along. So I guess anything's possible.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Oh, I'm always civil.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
It must be Scar who initiated hostilities.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Don't worry, {PlayerName}. It's easy to avoid someone when you're my size. You just dive in the grass and no one suspects a thing.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
That's the thing...

TAG: Buzz_008_f
I don't remember...

TAG: Player_002_f
Let's go see Scar. I'm sure...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...he remembers and will tell us.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...we can ask him.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...we can bribe him.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Something tells me he's not great at sharing, but you do know him better.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
Let's hope he decides to answer.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
He does seem like he'd be susceptible to corruption.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Well, he is a villain, after all. He must have been planning a nefarious scheme.

TAG: Player_003_f
Let's go see Scar. I want to...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
...put him back on the right track.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
...know what prompted this.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
...scold him...

TAG: Buzz_016_f
I'm impressed, {PlayerName}. That's just what my best friend Woody would have said.

TAG: Buzz_017_f
Good idea. If we know the reason why, maybe we can avoid another encounter...

TAG: Buzz_018_f
Are you sure scolding a villain is the way to go? But it's your Village, and I trust you.
