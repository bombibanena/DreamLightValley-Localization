Ah, {PlayerName}! Just who I was looking for. There's something we need to discuss.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
On my last patrol, I heard an explosion and then an Alien fell from the sky.

TAG: Player_000_f
I know! We have <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> scattered all around the Village...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Woody and I are on a rescue mission.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Have you seen any more of them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's an alien invasion!

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Good for you, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Buzz_012_f
I've located some of the <ActivityItem>Alien Toys</ActivityItem> around the Valley.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
You know where they are? Why didn't you pick them up, then?

TAG: Buzz_015_f
Well, two of them are buried in the ground â one's on Dazzle Beach, and the other one's in the Glade of Trust.

TAG: Buzz_000_f
I've got a lot of features, but I don't have a magic Shovel to help me.

TAG: Buzz_016_f
And there is one stuck in a block of ice near a waterfall... Maybe if you had something to break it...

TAG: Buzz_018_f
Hm, sounds like I'll need my tools to help them. Anything else?

TAG: Buzz_017_f
I did hear a squeaking sound coming from Scar's Cave. But I don't think he'd take kindly to me barging in.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
I was in the process of organizing a rescue mission. But if you're on the case, I'll leave this in your capable hands.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
As a matter of fact, I have.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Don't worry, {PlayerName}. These toys are extremely squeaky but not hostile.
