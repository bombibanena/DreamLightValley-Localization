{PlayerName}, I've done a thorough surveillance of the Valley, but I've yet to find the best way to make myself useful here. Could you assist me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'd love to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Let's shelve this idea for a bit.

TAG: Buzz_028_f
Great! I... uh... well, I'm just not used to feeling unsure of myself.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
I've become quite skilled at being a toy, but here... I don't have to freeze whenever a human walks by.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Everyone I speak to is so... tall. Add to that, some of you have magic powers!

TAG: Buzz_005_f
I may have karate chop action and high-pressure space wings, but I don't have that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're a hero in your own way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Okay, what do you think Woody would do?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're my friend, so never doubt yourself.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
I'm glad you think so. I may be a foot tall and made of plastic, but part of me will always feel like a real Space Ranger.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
That's it, Buzz! That's what you can do around here. You can set up a Star Command outpost.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
You mean like a local law enforcement unit? Hmm... That just might work! I could go on missions, uncover mysteries, patrol the perimeter...

TAG: Buzz_013_f
And my first act will be to recruit you into the ranks.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Welcome aboard, cadet!

TAG: Buzz_006_f
We'll use the RV as Star Command headquarters. But we'll also need to build a transportation fleet.

TAG: Player_006_f
I'll make a <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Ship</ActivityItem> to put in front of it...

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
This is going to be a lot of fun.

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
That shouldn't be too complicated to build, right?

TAG: Player_006_choice_002_f
We can't be Space Rangers without a spaceship.

TAG: Buzz_030_f
That's the spirit!

TAG: Buzz_014_f
A <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Ship</ActivityItem> shouldn't be too difficult to construct for someone with your talents. You'll need <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Buzz_031_f
Not at all, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_032_f
Roger that, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_027_f
Well, I suppose he'd listen to his inner voice. But my inner voice mainly talks about saving the galaxy and fighting Zurg...

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Thanks, friend. You know, when I thought I was a real Space Ranger, I would never doubt myself.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Shelve?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Oh. Like a toy. Ha-ha.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Clever wordplay, {PlayerName}. I'll be here when you have the time.
