Congratulations on another successful mission, cadet.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
You've shown that you can locate resources in an unfamiliar environment.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Now, let's see if you can find resources without my assistance.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
If we're going to hand out <ActivityItem>Buzz Lightyear Leaflets</ActivityItem>, you'll have to locate <ActivityItem>Sheets of Paper</ActivityItem> to create them.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Now, who could have <ActivityItem>Sheets of Paper</ActivityItem> to lend us...?

TAG: Player_001_f
I'm gonna go with Merlin...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He writes a lot for his research.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
He practically lives in that library.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
His library is so cluttered, there must be paper in there.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
It's always good to have a contact who can handle Research and Development.

TAG: Player_000_f
I think we'll need more paper than that. I'll check with Mickey and Donald, too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I can always count on them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Their houses have been around the longest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They won't make me pay for it.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
There's nothing more valuable than friends you can rely on.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Now, once you have the <ActivityItem>Sheets of Paper</ActivityItem>, combine them with the <ActivityItem>Buzz Lightyear Playing Cards</ActivityItem> using this <ActivityItem>Adhesive Bonding Agent</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Then, bring them to me for inspection as soon as you've finished.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
And therefore have the highest chances of containing surplus office supplies. I like your thinking, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
Well, considering we haven't discussed our operating budget, that's a wise choice.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Wow... Think of all the knowledge contained in there.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
As I recall, he does have a tendency to stockpile supplies.
