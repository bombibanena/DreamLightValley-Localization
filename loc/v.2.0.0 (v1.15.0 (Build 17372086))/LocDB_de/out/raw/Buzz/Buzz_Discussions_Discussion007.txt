{PlayerName}, I have a question... Have you ever realized something new about yourself? Or something new about the world around you?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Something that completely changed how you saw things?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I have.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, I haven't.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Interesting. And how did you handle that change?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I got really upset.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
I asked for help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I don't remember.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
That's understandable. I certainly... Let's just say I'm not proud of how I handled a few things in my past.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
The less we speak of the Mrs. Nesbitt incident, the better.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
I did too. And I got help from a good friend. That made all the difference.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
It's a... long story.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Hmm... A lot of people around here seem to have forgotten things. I hope it's just the Forgetting and not something even more sinister.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Then I suppose you've always known who you are. Who you're supposed to be. That must be... comforting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
It is!

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
It's actually kind of boring.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Well, I'm happy for you, {PlayerName}. You know, you remind me of Bonnie. She's never afraid to be herself. It's admirable.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
I guess having identity-shattering revelations does make life more interesting. Though I'm not sure it's the sort of interesting I want often.
