Cadet, on our last mission, we learnedâ

TAG: Buzz_002_f
... No, in fact, you helped me remember that being a hero isn't just about battling villains.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Would you have time to offer further assistance along those same lines?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm listening.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
In our debrief at the end of our last mission, you told me that heroism is about caring for others.

TAG: Buzz_017_f
But I haven't shown much care in my dealings with Ursula...

TAG: Buzz_020_f
I've got to make things right. I just don't know how.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Heartfelt apologies go a long way.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What would you expect from someone else?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You were wrong, Buzz. Just apologize.

TAG: Buzz_021_f
I had a feeling you were going to say that.

TAG: Buzz_026_f
And... you're right.

TAG: Buzz_027_f
Though, I had hoped there was a less uncomfortable way out.

TAG: Buzz_025_f
Well, I know what I have to do... Ahem. {PlayerName}, I don't suppose you'd come with me? It would be good to have some backup.

TAG: Buzz_022_f
Hmm... I guess when Woody knocked me out the window all those years ago, I wanted an apology.

TAG: Buzz_024_f
And to be treated politely.

TAG: Buzz_023_f
Apologize? Of course.

TAG: Buzz_028_f
Hmm... This is going to be awkward.

TAG: Buzz_029_f
But you're right...

TAG: Buzz_015_f
In our debrief at the end of our last mission, you told me that heroism is about giving others a chance to be better.

TAG: Buzz_018_f
But I didn't give Ursula the benefit of the doubt the last time I dealt with her...

TAG: Buzz_016_f
In our debrief at the end of our last mission, you told me that heroism is about looking past our first impressions.

TAG: Buzz_019_f
But I judged Ursula based on actions I didn't fully understand. I didn't take the time to ask her what she was doing.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Understood. I'll be waiting... and thinking.
