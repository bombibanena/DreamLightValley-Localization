She has no respect for me... or for Star Command's authority.

We'll need a new strategy. But where to start...?

It's okay, Buzz. I have an idea. You've just got a PR problem. I can make some <ActivityItem>Buzz Lightyear Leaflets</ActivityItem> so the Space Rangers are known as...

...champions of the innocent.

...a force to be reckoned with.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...a threat to evil everywhere.

Good thinking! We'll show everyone that wherever someone's in need, we'll be there to help.

Good thinking! We'll remind people that Star Command forces are defenders of peace and justice everywhere. Just like the package insert says.

Good thinking! We'll show people that wherever evil lurks in the Valley, we'll be there to fight it off.
