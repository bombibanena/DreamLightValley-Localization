Attention, {PlayerName}! This is a Zurg invasion drill!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A what?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You know Zurg's not real, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
An invasion? Give me details!

TAG: Buzz_001_f
The evil Emperor Zurg is the sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. And by association, Dreamlight Valley!

TAG: Buzz_002_f
He's extremely dangerous, dresses exclusively in purple, and speaks with a very deep voice.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
You know Zurg's not real, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Right! Got it. And he's invading us?

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Yes. I'm well aware that I'm a toy and Zurg â if he were here â would also be a toy. However, Zurg attack drills help keep everyone alert and ready.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
It's important to prepare for real threats, such as pets or over-enthusiastic younger siblings.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Okay. Tell me about this invasion.

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
I don't think I need an invasion drill.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Emperor Zurg has sent three spacecraft to attack our Valley. They're armed with lasers and converging on the Castle.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
How will you respond?

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
Ask Merlin to stop them with magic!

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
Ask Mickey to distract them and steal their spaceships!

TAG: Player_000_choice_011_f
Invite them to a picnic!

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Leveraging the Valley's unique advantage! A sound tactic. Zurg doesn't know about magic. He'll be completely flummoxed.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Well done, {PlayerName}. You've passed the invasion drill with flying colors. If this had been a real invasion, the Valley would be safe.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Turning the enemy's tools against them! Good strategy!

TAG: Buzz_009_f
An... unconventional strategy. But it just might work.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
That's what many think. Then an invasion of cranky toddlers happens, and they're completely unprepared.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
Don't be unprepared, {PlayerName}.
