Am I glad to see you!

TAG: Buzz_015_f
I'm afraid I'm in desperate need of assistance.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Whoa. Buzz Lightyear!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
{PlayerName} to the rescue.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm always happy to help.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Wait a minute... You don't look like one of Bonnie's toys.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm not a toy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'm a limited edition {PlayerName} action figure.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Why is everything here SO BIG?!

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Ah. I see. Well, don't worry. I understand exactly what you're going through.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
At first, I had some trouble accepting the truth myself.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
I'm really not a toy! Seriously! But I would like to help.

TAG: Buzz_016_f
My name's {PlayerName}. What do you need me to do?

TAG: Buzz_017_f
Well, I was in the middle of a very important rescue mission when suddenlyâ

*<bzzt>* There's a s-s-secret mIIiiissionâ *<bzzt>*

TAG: Buzz_000_f
*<bzzt>* âin uncharted spaAAAaace! *<bzzt>*

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
... Are you okay?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are your batteries dying?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Uh... what?

TAG: Buzz_020_f
Oh no.

TAG: Buzz_025_f
There should be spares around the room.

TAG: Buzz_026_f
Check over by the closet...

TAG: Buzz_027_f
...or maybe near theâ *<bzzt>* "This is an intergalLLLLactic eMERrgency!" *<bzzt>*

TAG: Buzz_028_f
Over by the... What?!

TAG: Buzz_029_f
There's no time. <Lore>Search the room for AA batteries</Lore> and try not toâ

TAG: Buzz_031_f
And whatever you do, do NOTâ

TAG: Buzz_035_f
*<bzzt>* BuuUUUUuuzz Lightyear to the rescuuueeeâ *<bzzt>*

TAG: Buzz_021_f
It's happening again.

TAG: Buzz_022_f
What's happening again?!

TAG: Buzz_024_f
My batteries are depleting.

TAG: Buzz_019_f
And now my electronic features are acting up. My voice box keeps triggerâ

TAG: Buzz_023_f
*<bzzt>* To infiNNNity and beyOOoâ *<bzzt>*

TAG: Buzz_032_f
And my laser won't stop firing off at random times.

TAG: Buzz_034_f
No need to worry, though; it's just a light bulb.

TAG: Buzz_033_f
Say no more. Why don't you just stay here while I <Lore>find you some new batteries</Lore>?

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Impressive. And look at all those points of articulation!

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Bonnie's parents must have bought you recently.

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Okay, so, I'm not really a toy. But I would like to help.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
I don't understand. Everything here is precisely the right size.

TAG: Buzz_012_f
I guess it's not that everything is so big...

TAG: Buzz_013_f
...but that I'm not used to being so small.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
You see, I'm not really a toy. But I'd still like to help you however I can.
