Are our recruits ready to join the ranks of Star Command?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ready and impatient!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I recruited each of them personally.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Scar was a little reluctant...

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Great news, cadet!

TAG: Buzz_007_f
There are only a few things left to do. Let's make sure our headquarters appears inviting and that our uniforms are in top-notch shape.

I suggest a proper landing pad for our <ActivityItem>Ship</ActivityItem>. <ActivityItem>Asphalt</ActivityItem> should work. And a <ActivityItem>Blue Balloon Arch</ActivityItem> for the ceremony... I'll leave that to you.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
Once the items are complete, let's put them around the RV... I uh, I mean, Star Command... so it's ready for the welcoming ceremony.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Good job, cadet. There's a special role for each of them with Star Command, and I'm sure you let them know just what it would be.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
But I'm sure he came around thanks to you.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Diplomacy is an important skill, cadet. And you seem to have mastered it early.
