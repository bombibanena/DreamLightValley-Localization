Something's still not right. Maybe if I fiddle with the switch on his back...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll pull the switch to the left!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'll pull the switch to the right!

BitÃ¡cora espacial: me he despertado del hipersueÃ±o en un planeta extraÃ±o.

TAG: Buzz_026_f
But the mission... Well, let's just say it did not proceed according to plan.

TAG: Buzz_027_f
Woody got knocked out the window while on reconnaissance...

TAG: Buzz_028_f
Woody got knocked out the window?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We've got to rescue him.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
How did that happen?

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
Wish I'd been there to see that.

TAG: Buzz_014_f
Uh oh... that's not right.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
Estoy rodeado por criaturas extraÃ±as y desconozco sus intenciones. Â¿QuiÃ©n anda ahÃ­? Â¿Amigo o enemigo?

TAG: Buzz_018_f
I guess that was the wrong way... I'll switch him back...

TAG: Buzz_019_f
Phew! That's better.

TAG: Buzz_020_f
You have my gratitude.

TAG: Buzz_021_f
Now that we've solved that problem...

TAG: Buzz_024_f
...what were you trying to say to me before?

TAG: Buzz_025_f
Oh, right. Ahem. Bonnie â the child whose room this is â has gone on vacation with her family and left Woody and me behind on an important mission.

TAG: Buzz_033_f
I'm way ahead of you, my friend. But I like your enthusiasm.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Time to fly.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Shields to maximum.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Full speed ahead!

TAG: Buzz_030_f
I tried to help him get back inside, but the window slammed down and locked. Unfortunately, the latch is too high to reach.

TAG: Buzz_034_f
I was in the middle of executing a rescue mission when my batteries started to act up.

TAG: Buzz_035_f
Rescue mission? What were you planning?

TAG: Buzz_036_f
Do you see the race car tracks all around the room?

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Well, I was planning to build the track and launch a toy car at the latch on the window.

TAG: Buzz_037_f
If it's hit at precisely the right angle, it'll unlock and Woody can get back inside.

TAG: Buzz_038_f
There are just a few parts of the track left to put together.

TAG: Buzz_039_f
Would you care to assist me?

TAG: Buzz_040_f
I'll take that as a "yes."

TAG: Buzz_041_f
Start by <Lore>finding the rest of the pieces of the track</Lore>.

TAG: Buzz_042_f
If you could bring them back to me once you've got them all, we can finish it together.

TAG: Buzz_031_f
Let's just say it involved a spinning lamp and a great deal of angular momentum.

TAG: Buzz_032_f
It was certainly a sight to see. I'd call it "falling without style."
