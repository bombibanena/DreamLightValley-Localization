{PlayerName}, are you ready to confront your first threat as a Space Ranger cadet?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry, I'm still reading the training manual. Maybe later.

Now, it's time to confront that sea witch, Ursula. I don't know what hostile waters she comes from, but I know she's planning some sort of nefarious scheme.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
We need to put an end to it before it's too late.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No time to lose. Let's go.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What proof do you have?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Let's not bother Ursula. She'll turn both of us into algae...

TAG: Buzz_009_f
That's the spirit!

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Well, she's constantly swimming around the Village trying to cut questionable deals...

TAG: Buzz_012_f
And she cackles. In my experience, only villains cackle.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Trust me. She's up to something. And it's up to us to stop her!

TAG: Buzz_011_f
Hey now, we can't let our fear of danger interfere with our mission, cadet. Follow me!

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Excellent. And don't worry, {PlayerName}. It's perfectly normal to be nervous about your first mission. But I'll be right beside you.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Of course, but remember: Training will only take you so far.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
At some point, you have to get out there and take on whatever challenge is facing you.
