{PlayerName}, would you like me to run you through a quick space-flight training scenario?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure, sounds fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This sounds dangerous.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Fun? Most definitely. But it's also serious business.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
The skills you learn from training scenarios like this will help you if you ever have to pilot a real interstellar spacecraft.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Okay. Hit me with this scenario.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
You're piloting a small starfighter. The hyperdrive has been damaged. Zurg's minions are on your tail, firing positron torpedoes at you.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
What sort of maneuver do you use to get away from Zurg's minions?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I slingshot my starfighter around the Sun.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I turn around and face them head-on.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I lead them right into an asteroid field.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Yes! The gravitational force should be exactly what it takes to get you far away from Zurg's attack ships...

TAG: Buzz_012_f
...and give you time to repair your hyperdrive.

TAG: Buzz_013_f
Smart thinking, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
That's bold. You might not be able to outrun them...

TAG: Buzz_010_f
...but with a sudden offensive maneuver, you might just surprise them enough to gain the upper hand.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
A small interstellar spacecraft might be able to weave between the asteroids...

TAG: Buzz_011_f
...but Zurg's attack ships wouldn't stand a chance.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
It's all strictly hypothetical.
