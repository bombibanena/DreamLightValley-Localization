Nice work, cadet. Now let's hop in and head out on patrol.

TAG: Player_000_f
Er, I made the <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Ship</ActivityItem> to your specifications, so it's kinda small...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's going to be a tight squeeze for me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't fit in that thing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Er... let's patrol later.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Ah, yes. I see how that could be a problem. Also, you're not exactly ready for official Space Ranger duties yet.

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Before we do anything else, you need a proper <ActivityItem>Uniform</ActivityItem>.

I understand Scrooge McDuck is in charge of commerce around here. I suggest you speak to him.

It's a spaceship, {PlayerName}. From the films I've seen, they are often bigger on the inside.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
But you are missing one thing that's essential for all Space Rangers...

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Good call, {PlayerName}. I just realized, we can't go on patrol yet. You're missing something critical to all Space Rangers.
