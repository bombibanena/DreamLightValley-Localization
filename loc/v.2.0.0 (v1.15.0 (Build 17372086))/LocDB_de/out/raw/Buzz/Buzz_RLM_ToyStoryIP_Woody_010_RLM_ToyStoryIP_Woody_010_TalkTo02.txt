{PlayerName}, how goes the mission?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
We have almost everything now... except something to hold Bonnie's farm together.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Not to worry! While performing a survey of the Valley, I located the perfect thing.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
It's an extremely powerful <ActivityItem>Adhesive Bonding Agent</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
According to the package, it's strong enough to repair a broken hammer. And we know how much stress those take.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Wow. I didn't know we had anything like that in Dreamlight Valley. Let's see it.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Here you go.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Great work, Space Ranger.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This is very futuristic stuff.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This is just glue, Buzz...

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Anything to help Bonnie.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
If that doesn't hold Bonnie's farm together, nothing will.

TAG: Buzz_009_f
It is?!

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Oh. Bonnie's parents use that all the time.
