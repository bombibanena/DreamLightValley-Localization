Woody filled me in on the situation. How are we going to put Bonnie's farm back together again?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
Well, I've been thinking... Bonnie made special blueprints that show exactly how she wanted it to look. They're still taped up around the room.

Hmm... You mean all those drawings on the walls? The ones on colored construction paper?

Impressive observational skills, {PlayerName}.

There's just one problem. Some of them are hard to reach. Woody got himself knocked out the window trying to get to them all.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Hmm... I could <Lore>take pictures of all of the drawings</Lore> with my camera?

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Excellent idea. Then we'll look at the drawings and recreate the farm exactly the way Bonnie wants.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Using all the tools at your disposal, eh? Now that's thinking like a Space Ranger.

Just let me know as soon as you have pictures of all the drawings.
