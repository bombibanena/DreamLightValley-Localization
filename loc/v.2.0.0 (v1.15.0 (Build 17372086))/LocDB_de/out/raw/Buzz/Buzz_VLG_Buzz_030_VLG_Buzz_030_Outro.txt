Being a hero isn't just about fighting evil. It's also about...

...caring for those around you.

...giving others a chance to be better.

...not judging others from a first impression.

Here in Dreamlight Valley, the villains aren't out for world domination. They seem to just want to live here in peace like everybody else.

I've never thought of it that way...

Maybe I shouldn't be so surprised. At the end of the day, we're all sharing the same toy box called Dreamlight Valley.

Thanks for your help, {PlayerName}, but I need some time to... process all this.

Living together with villains in Dreamlight Valley gives us a chance to help them be better. We can show them they don't need evil schemes to get what they want.

That's very wise. I never thought of it that way...

Every villain in Dreamlight Valley has a story. They're more than just villains once you get to know them.

That's very wise. I never thought of it that way...
