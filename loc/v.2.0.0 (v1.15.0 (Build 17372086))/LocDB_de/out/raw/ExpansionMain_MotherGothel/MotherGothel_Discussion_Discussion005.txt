I've been criticized for how I treated Rapunzel, but you must understand...

...it was all for her own good! She really was far too naive.

The dangers of the outside world would have destroyed her!

I don't think that's true.

Right. It has nothing to do with the fact that you needed her hair.

Is it possible she was naive because she grew up in a tower?

If you were her mother, you would know better than to say such things. No one loves her like I do. Or cared for her like I did.

Needed her hair? What on earth are you talking about? What an absurd concept. Needing hair. What does that even mean?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Let's pretend you didn't say it and never talk about this again.

Now don't come at me with that silly logic of yours. It wasn't her upbringing. It was her nature. She was too soft. A delicate flower.
