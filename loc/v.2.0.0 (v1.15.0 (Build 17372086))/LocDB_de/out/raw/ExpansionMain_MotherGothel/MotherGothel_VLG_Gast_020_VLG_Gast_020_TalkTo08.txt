Mother Gothel! We're trying to find the owner of this climbing pick â are you missing one?

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
A climbing pick that might be mine? What could you possibly be thinking, {PlayerName}?

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Well, sometimes you might need to climb up a steep, rocky surface...

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Now, why would I bother with climbing...

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
...when I can simply be lifted by... other means.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
I assure you, the item is not mine.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll keep looking for the proper owner.
