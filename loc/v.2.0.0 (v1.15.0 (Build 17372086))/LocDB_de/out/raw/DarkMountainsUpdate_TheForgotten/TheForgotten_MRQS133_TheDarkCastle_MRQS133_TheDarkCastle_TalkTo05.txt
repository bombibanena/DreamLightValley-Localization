Huh? You again?!

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
How did you make it past all my doors?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was tough. But I did it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
As villainous lairs go, this one could use some work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Ever considered a security system? Maybe some cameras and alarms?

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
Well, sorry to tell you, but all your hard work was for nothing.

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
I've already cast the spell. Not even I could stop it now.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
We can stop this. Together.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Please. Think of our friends in the Village.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're about to destroy the universe.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
Together? Ha! Yeah, sure. You know, if you hadn't abandoned me here in the first place... none of this would be happening.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
I never meant for you to be left behind. I didn't know. I just... I got caught up in my own life.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
More lies. More lies to try to confuse me.

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
All I want to do is make sure no one ever goes through what I went through. I won't let you ruin that.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Please. I don't want to fight.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm going to stop you. However I have to.

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
I'm excited to see whose magic is stronger.

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
You don't want to fight because you know I'll win.

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
You asked for this. Let's go.

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
Then we've got nothing more to talk about.

TAG: TheForgotten_022_f
Duh. Obviously mine.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
Did they think of me when I disappeared from the Village?

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Everyone tried their best. But the Forgetting... the Night Thorns... there was nothing anyone could do.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
What...? No, I'm not. Don't lie to me.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
I'm not lying. The magic you're messing with... It's dangerous.

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
Hey! I think I did a pretty good job in here.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Ugh. You're trying to get to me. But it won't work. It's too late for that.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
Thanks for the tip. But I won't be needing that. You're already too late.
