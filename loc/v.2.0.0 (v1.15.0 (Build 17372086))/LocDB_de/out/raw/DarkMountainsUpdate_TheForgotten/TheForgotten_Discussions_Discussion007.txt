Hey, {PlayerName}... I've only ever known Dreamlight Valley and the Dark Castle.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
What's it like out there...? You know... the grown-up world and all that junk.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Amazing! You can eat as much ice cream as you want.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Terrible! There's less time for just enjoying yourself.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
It's not as different from being a kid as you might think.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
There's only one problem. You can eat all the ice cream you want... but you know that you probably shouldn't.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Hm...

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Well, I don't think I'll let that stop me.

TAG: Player_003_exit_000_f
Gotta go!

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
When you're a kid, hours just go by without having to worry about anything. Growing up means having homework pretty much all the time.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
That sounds awful.

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Guess I'm lucky I don't have to deal with all that.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
A lot of people might look like adults, but they feel like kids inside. They just get better at hiding it.

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
I guess things will always be scary and confusing, no matter how old you get.

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
Yeah. But you get a lot better at handling it. Hopefully...
