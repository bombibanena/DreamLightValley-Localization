Do you ever feel like no matter how hard you try, you can't find the right words to say how you feel?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
All the time.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Sometimes.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Never.

TAG: TheForgotten_026_f
Feelings are some of the biggest, scariest, and most complicated things in the world. It's hard to put them into words.

TAG: TheForgotten_027_f
Thank you! UGH! It's so tough.

TAG: TheForgotten_028_f
So what do you do when you have a feeling that's all tangled up and you don't know what word to use?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
I make up a whole new word.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I combine words together.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
I make a noise to express my inexpressible emotion.

TAG: TheForgotten_029_f
Oh. That's a good idea.

TAG: TheForgotten_030_f
I think I'll call this emotion...

TAG: TheForgotten_031_f
..."grazzleplap."

TAG: TheForgotten_032_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I feel... weirdly better?

TAG: Player_005_exit_000_f
Gotta go!

TAG: TheForgotten_033_f
..."frijjimorp."

TAG: TheForgotten_034_f
..."bramblesnorp."

TAG: TheForgotten_035_f
That makes sense.

TAG: TheForgotten_036_f
I guess I could call the emotion I'm having...

TAG: TheForgotten_037_f
...angrysad.

TAG: TheForgotten_038_f
...confuscared.

TAG: TheForgotten_039_f
...infurianxious.

TAG: TheForgotten_040_f
Just... a noise? I think I'd feel kind of silly doing that.

TAG: TheForgotten_041_f
Come on! It's just you and me here. Let's hear it!

TAG: TheForgotten_042_f
Ugh. Okay. Here goes nothing.

TAG: TheForgotten_043_f
Rlfjfjfsjjsfs!

TAG: TheForgotten_044_f

TAG: TheForgotten_045_f

TAG: TheForgotten_046_f
Feelings can be big and scary and complicated. It's not always easy to put them into words.

TAG: TheForgotten_047_f
I've worked really hard to find ways to put my feelings into words. Even when they're big and scary and complicated. It took a while, but now it's easier.

TAG: TheForgotten_048_f
Really?! Ugh. Now I feel even WORSE.

TAG: TheForgotten_049_f
Don't feel bad! It just means I'll have an easier time helping you.
