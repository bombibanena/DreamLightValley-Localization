I'm feeling pretty good today.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
It's... weird.

Embrace happiness whenever you find it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Happiness is just as real as sadness.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
What sparked this feeling?

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
I guess that's true. I shouldn't waste this feeling.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Maybe I'll write some happy poems today.

TAG: Player_003_exit_000_f
Gotta go!

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Huh. That's true. I guess.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
I'll try to look at it like that more often. Thanks!

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
I guess I was thinking about all the people here in the Valley who I think of as... friends.

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Friends are important. Especially as you get older.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
You've got to hold on to the ones you've got, because it gets harder and harder to make new ones!

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
You're right. I guess I should tell my friends that I'm happy they're around... even if it feels a little cheesy.

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
Thanks for being my friend, {PlayerName}.
