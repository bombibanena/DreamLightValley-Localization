Hey, so, I... Actually, I was wondering if... maybe...

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
Forget it. It's silly...

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
I won't push you, but I'm always here to talk.

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
Come on! Spill it! What's up?

TAG: TheForgotten_022_f
Thanks...

TAG: TheForgotten_023_f
...

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
Ugh. Fine... I'll tell you.

TAG: TheForgotten_025_f
I wrote some poetry today. But I'm having trouble with a couple of parts. I was wondering if maybe you could help me?

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
Sure! I'm a great poet.

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
I'll do my best...

TAG: TheForgotten_026_f
Okay... let's give this a try...

TAG: TheForgotten_027_f
What would be a good rhyme for <Lore>"Woe consumes my very soul"</Lore>?

TAG: Player_008_choice_000_f
"I fear that I'll never be whole."

TAG: Player_008_choice_001_f
"I'm hungry for a jelly roll."

TAG: TheForgotten_028_f
Whoa. I like it. You're good at this.

TAG: TheForgotten_029_f
Let's try another one.

TAG: TheForgotten_030_f
"My wounded heart can take no more..."

TAG: Player_009_choice_000_f
"I've never had what I've long yearned for."

TAG: Player_009_choice_001_f
"I want my own pet dinosaur."

TAG: TheForgotten_031_f
Wow, {PlayerName}. That gave me actual chills.

TAG: TheForgotten_032_f
There's only one more line I need a rhyme for...

TAG: TheForgotten_033_f
"I fear I'm doomed to a lonely fate..."

TAG: Player_010_choice_000_f
"And now, bereft, I lie in wait."

TAG: Player_010_choice_001_f
"Something something... carbonate."

TAG: TheForgotten_034_f
That... is... AMAZING! I should ask you for help with all my poetry!

TAG: Player_011_exit_000_f
Gotta go!

TAG: TheForgotten_035_f
Huh? That doesn't make any sense.

TAG: TheForgotten_036_f
Maybe I'll try asking someone else for help writing this. I bet Goofy knows some good rhymes...

TAG: TheForgotten_037_f
... Huh? That's not really the feel I'm going for in this poem.

TAG: TheForgotten_038_f
Although... now that you mention it... a pet dinosaur would be pretty cool.

TAG: TheForgotten_039_f
... That doesn't really capture the vibe I'm going for.
