After all this time... here we are. Face to face.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
I have all these... these memories in my head all of a sudden. You must have seen them too.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
So you must know what I am by now.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're my inner child, aren't you?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You're everything I left behind.

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
You're some sort of shadow of me.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
You split off from me when I stopped visiting Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Inner child...? But how can we really say which one of us is the real {PlayerName}?

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Maybe you're just the part that moved on. A piece of ME that left...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It doesn't matter. I just want to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No sudden moves... I'm watching you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's enough. Get out of my way.

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
I don't want to hurt you. Really. I want to help.

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
Is that what you think about me? That I'm... I'm some kind of weakling who needs "help"?

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
Maybe I was. Once. But not anymore.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Needing help doesn't make you weak.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You put on a big show... but I can tell you're scared.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
That's what Merlin was trying to tell you. Caring for others... That's not something you leave behind.

TAG: TheForgotten_032_f
Busy? Doing what...?

TAG: TheForgotten_035_f
Do you expect me to just tell you my whole plan?! Like some kind of... some kind of villain at the end of a movie?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
If you've got a plan... I can help.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I mean... you're kind of giving off that vibe?

TAG: TheForgotten_022_f
It makes us stronger. Not weaker. It holds the Valley together.

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
Please. Let us help you.

TAG: TheForgotten_028_f
You think I didn't TRY to ask for help? After that day with Scar... no one could hear me.

TAG: TheForgotten_029_f
I was trapped in the shadows. Alone. Lost. It takes all my magic now just to step out into the light.

TAG: TheForgotten_030_f
But you're here now. Let's fix all of this.

TAG: TheForgotten_025_f
Fix all of this? That's exactly what I've been trying to do.

TAG: TheForgotten_031_f
I haven't been hiding.

TAG: TheForgotten_026_f
I've been busy.

TAG: TheForgotten_036_f
You could never help. Because you could never understand.

TAG: TheForgotten_027_f
There's only one way to make sure that no one ever gets pulled to the dark side of Dreamlight Valley like I was.

TAG: TheForgotten_038_f
Only one way to make sure no one is ever lonely again.

TAG: TheForgotten_033_f
I need to rip open the walls between worlds. Between Dreamlight Valley and the other side.

TAG: TheForgotten_040_f
And now I have the last thing I was missing. The way to fuel the spell. <Lore>The Orb of Remembrance</Lore>!

TAG: TheForgotten_037_f
You still don't get it. I'm not the bad guy. YOU are.

TAG: TheForgotten_023_f
If you really felt like you were so strong, then you wouldn't have stayed in the shadows all this time. Whatever was happening to you... Merlin could have helped.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
I want to talk, but... you better not try to rip open a portal or hex me or anything like that!

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
Heh. You're afraid of me? Good. You should be.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Maybe Merlin should have been afraid of me too. Instead of thinking I was some weakling who needed his help.

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
After everything you've done to this Village... we've got nothing more to talk about.

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
Step aside so I can fix the damage you've done.

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
Fix the damage...? Heh.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Don't you see that running around and helping everybody... it makes them weak. And it makes YOU weak too.

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
When I stopped visiting Dreamlight Valley... when I let go of my childlike wonder... You're all of that.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
What you left behind...? But how can you really say which one of us is the real {PlayerName}?

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
When I left Dreamlight Valley... I left a shadow, an echo. And that's you.

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
ME? How do you know I'm not the REAL {PlayerName}? What if YOU'RE the echo?!
