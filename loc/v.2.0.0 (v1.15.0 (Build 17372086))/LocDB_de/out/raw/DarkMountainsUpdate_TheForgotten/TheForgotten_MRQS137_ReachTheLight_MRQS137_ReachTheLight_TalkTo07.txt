Did you see that?

The second we focused our magic... The sandbox looks just how I remember it.

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
It's starting to come back to me, too.

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
Do you remember what it was like...? Being just a little kid?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The only limit was your imagination.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Even little plastic beach toys seemed magical.

A sandbox could be a whole world.

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
Yeah. We used to play for hours. Making up stories. Going on adventures.

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
... I miss that. I wish it could be that way again.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Maybe it can be.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
I... I wish I could believe that...

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
Ugh. Whatever. Just... <Lore>follow me</Lore>. I think there's more stuff hidden in here.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
Ha! It's true. Even a little plastic beach toy buried in the sand seemed like a lost magical artifact from ten thousand years ago.

I know. You could visit the deepest part of the jungle, or the middle of the desert, or the far reaches of the galaxy without ever leaving your backyard.
