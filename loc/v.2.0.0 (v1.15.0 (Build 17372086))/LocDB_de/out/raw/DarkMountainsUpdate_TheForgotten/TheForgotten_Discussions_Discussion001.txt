{PlayerName}, do you ever feel like... like... ugh, I dunno...

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
...like nobody will ever really like you because you're too weird?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
All the time.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Sometimes.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Never!

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
Huh? Really...? But EVERYBODY seems to like you.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Maybe. But that doesn't mean I don't get anxious sometimes.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Great. That almost makes me feel worse. If YOU feel like that... then what hope is there for a weirdo like me?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Everybody's a little bit weird in their own way.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
What makes you weird is what makes you special.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
If you're too weird for somebody... that's their problem.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Besides, what even is so-called "normal"? Trust me. Normal is overrated.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
You just gotta find the people who appreciate your particular kind of weirdness.

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
... Maybe you're right.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Talking about that... actually made me feel kind of better. ... Weird.

TAG: Player_005_exit_000_f
Gotta go!

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
Yeah. That figures. Everybody seems to like you.

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
What hope is there for a weirdo like me?
