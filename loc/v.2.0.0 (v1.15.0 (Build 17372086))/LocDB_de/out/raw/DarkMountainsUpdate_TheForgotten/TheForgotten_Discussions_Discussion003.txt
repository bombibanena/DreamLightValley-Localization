Ugh. Nobody GETS me.

TAG: Player_002_f
I've felt that way too. Does it make you...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...angry?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...upset?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...scared?

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
I... Yeah, I guess I'm angry.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
But it's funny. Now that you mention it... I guess I'm really more scared.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Or... or maybe I'm upset.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Ugh. Why are feelings so CONFUSING?

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Sometimes when we ignore our feelings, they can change into something else. Maybe that's what's happening.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Don't push those tough feelings away, okay? You have every right to feel them.

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
... Okay, fine. I'm starting to think that maybe... at least one person understands me.

TAG: Player_003_exit_000_f
Gotta go!

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
Upset?! What? No, I'm mad.

TAG: TheForgotten_022_f
... Okay, I guess... I am upset. Underneath the anger.

TAG: TheForgotten_023_f
But I guess what I really am is scared.

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
Scared?! You think that scares me? No. I'm angry.

TAG: TheForgotten_025_f
Or... or maybe I am scared. I don't know. Now that I think about it some more...
