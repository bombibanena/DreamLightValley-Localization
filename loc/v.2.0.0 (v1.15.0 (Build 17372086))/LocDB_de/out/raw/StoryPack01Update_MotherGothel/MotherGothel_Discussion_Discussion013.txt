You're frowning.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Of course I am.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
My patience is being tried beyond belief!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe you could try some calming breaths?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's getting you down?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I wouldn't describe you as particularly cheery...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Why didn't I think of that?

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Oh, of course. Because SOMEONE is preventing me!

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
That little metal assemblage, clanking away everywhere. Constantly humming and whistling. Ever since he got those new clothes, he's been insufferable!

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
And he's giving me a constant headache!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
WALLÂ·E is just trying to make people happy...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How rude!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Can't you tolerate it for now?

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Yes... Fine... Bravo for him.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
But can you not make him do it more quietly?!

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Finally, someone agrees!

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Of course, if you truly agreed, you would have already done something about the noise...

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Tolerating it is exactly what I've been doing.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
The question is: Why should I have to?!

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
A horrific occurrence!

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
And why is my mood of any concern of yours?!

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
OK, I'm sorry!

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
What's bugging you?
