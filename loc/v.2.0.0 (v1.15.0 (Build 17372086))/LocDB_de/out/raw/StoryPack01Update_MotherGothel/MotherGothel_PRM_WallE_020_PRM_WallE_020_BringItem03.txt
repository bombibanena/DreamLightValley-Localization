{PlayerName}! I hope you don't need anything, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Surely you can see that I'm busy? Come back, oh... a year from now?

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
I'm just teasing! Oh, the look on your face. You're always welcome! You know that.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Here! I have something for you!

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
You do? Well, why didn't you say so?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I tried, but you cut me off andâ

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sorry. Can you ever forgive me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do you want it or not?!

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Don't be silly; I'd never do such a thing.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
... Well, hurry along with it, {PlayerName}. I told you: I'm busy.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
I have an invitation for you. It's to a magic moment on Dazzle Beach with someone special!

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
An invitation from a secret admirer?

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Finally!

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
The fact that it's taken this long is a clear indication of the lack of taste among everyone in this Village.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You aren't exactly going out of your way to be friendly...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I completely agree!

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Nonsense! I'm the warmest and most welcoming person you'll ever meet.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Now... who's the invitation from?

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
It's a surprise.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
How intriguing...

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Head over to <ActivityItem>Dazzle Beach</ActivityItem> at the time listed on the invitation.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
My curiosity IS rather piqued... All right. I'll do it!

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Ta-ta, {PlayerName}!

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
Then why haven't you done something about it? ... Oh, I'm only teasing! You really must relax, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
Possibly. Especially if you have a gift for me!

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
Of course. No need to be rude, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
Didn't your elders teach you any manners?
