A dog guards the Underworld.

Don't you take care of Cerberus?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not really.

TAG: Hades_001_f
Oh, Cerberus. Sure, but he's easy.

TAG: Hades_004_f
I toss him three steaks three times a day...

TAG: Hades_006_f
Okay. Maybe I like ONE dog.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Oh sure. But that's easy.

TAG: Hades_003_f
