NO.

TAG: Hades_001_f
No. It's okay. It's fine. Fine. I'm cool. I'm fine.

Did something happen?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's funny how your hair got all smolder-y for a second.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's okay to be angry.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Nothing big. A minor setback in a plan I'm not talkin' about.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Because I don't want SOMEONE meddling with it.

TAG: Hades_006_f
I'll just move a few things around and make it work.

It's okay to be angry.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Funny. Great. Yeah, that's really funny. I'm so glad I amuse you.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Oh, I know. Believe me, I know! And there is a LOT that makes me angry.

TAG: Hades_008_f
But I'm guessin' you don't wanna see me REALLY angry.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Let's just say furniture tends to incinerate.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Oh, I'm sorry.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That's inconvenient.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I can build new furniture.

TAG: Hades_010_f
It's fine. Whatever. I'm fine.

TAG: Hades_011_f
Yeah. A bit. Not for me. Others, yeah. But not me.

TAG: Hades_012_f
Oh. Nice. Yeah, you would say that.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Always the helpful little do-gooder, aren't ya?
