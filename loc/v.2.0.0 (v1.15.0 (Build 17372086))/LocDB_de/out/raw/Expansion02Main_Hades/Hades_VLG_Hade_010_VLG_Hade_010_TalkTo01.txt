There you go, Hades; all cleaned up!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Finally! I was getting tired of stubbing my toe on all that marble.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Happy to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
But... you're a god.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
At least it wasn't your heel.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Well, aren't you an eager little head minion.

TAG: Hades_008_f
It's kinda bare now, though, isn't it?

TAG: Hades_009_f
True, seeing as how I'm the god of the Underworld, not the god of interior decorating. I don't suppose you'd have any ideas?

TAG: Hades_010_f
What kind of dÃ©cor would you want to put in here?

TAG: Hades_011_f
Well... as much as I hate the ol' bolt thrower, he does know how to glam up a place. Let me think...

TAG: Hades_012_f
Ah-ha! That's what this place needs â statues! Of me!

TAG: Hades_013_f
Craft some statues? I can work with this.

TAG: Hades_014_f
Good. Then you can <Lore>place them all over the Elysian Fields</Lore>.

TAG: Hades_015_f
People need to know who the boss is around here.

TAG: Hades_000_f
Well, aren't you an eager little intermediate minion.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Well, aren't you an eager little associate minion.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Well, aren't you an eager little junior minion.

TAG: Hades_003_f
So...

TAG: Hades_004_f
In case you haven't figured it out by now, I annoy easily. And bumping into the dÃ©cor is ANNOYING!

TAG: Hades_005_f
Unlike Achilles, my heels are just fine, thank you. Oh, and I suggest you leave the history to the chumps with the scrolls.
