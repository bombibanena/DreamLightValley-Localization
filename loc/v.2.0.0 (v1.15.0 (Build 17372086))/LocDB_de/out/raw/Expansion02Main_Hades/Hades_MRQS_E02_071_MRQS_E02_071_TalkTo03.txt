Phew! Am I glad to finally be out of there!

TAG: Hades_013_f
And these <ActivityItem>Vases</ActivityItem> are really gonna liven up my throne room.

TAG: Hades_001_f
Only one small problem.

TAG: Hades_003_f
There's some kinda magic still lockin' me outta Mount Olympus.

TAG: Hades_004_f
The same kind of magic that was inside that trial. Which, for some reason, my god powers have NO effect on. I cannot tell you how frustrating that is!

TAG: Hades_006_f
So, anyway, I'm gonna need a place to live until I can take back my rightful home.

TAG: Player_001_f
I can build you a place to stay for now. What kind of place do you want?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'll bet you want some cool marble columns.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
A chic bungalow with a hammock out back?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
How about a retro modern duplex?

TAG: Hades_011_f
Ya know, I'm not really feeling that right now.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Thing is, I'm almost startin' to miss the Underworld. All this sunlight is messing with my complexion.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Maybe somethin' a little dark, a little gloomy.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Uh, hold the dead people though.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Yeah, not really my style.

TAG: Hades_012_f
How about, uh... NO! I don't know what any of those words mean, but they all sound awful.

TAG: Hades_005_f
There's still a whole lotta ink blocking the way to Mount Olympus.
