So, you managed to find that Sacred Spring...

TAG: Hades_002_f
Say, just out of curiosity, purely academic interest... where is it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Nuh uh. Not telling you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why are you so eager to know?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I can show you later. What should I do next?

TAG: Hades_003_f
What?! Why not?

TAG: Hades_004_f
Because I don't trust you.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Grr! This is all because of that yappy book badmouthing me, isn't it?

TAG: Hades_006_f
We'll talk about that later.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Right. What should I do next?

TAG: Hades_008_f
Well, the water from that Sacred Spring is only good for dealing with <Lore>myth magic</Lore>. You'll need more than that for Maleficent's part of the flames.

TAG: Hades_009_f
I guess I'll need to collect some more Ingredients to make this potion...

TAG: Hades_007_f
What? A guy can't wanna know where a magical source of water is without raising suspicions?

TAG: Hades_011_f
Ah, forget it. We'll talk about that later.
