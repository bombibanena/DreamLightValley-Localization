Hey Hades, you wanted to see me?

TAG: Hades_002_f
Yes! You! Sit down; I want to talk leadership with someone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll stand â what's up?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't deal with this now.

TAG: Hades_003_f
I have some questions for you. When I say "Hades is a skilled and inspiring leader," how do you feel about that statement...?

TAG: Hades_004_f
Strongly agree, neutral, or strongly disagree?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Strongly agree!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Neutral.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Strongly disagree!

TAG: Hades_005_f
FINALLY! I have been waiting to hear that!

TAG: Hades_014_f
So far you're the only person to give a positive response to this survey.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Which is ridiculous. Clearly, I'm a skilled and inspiring leader.

TAG: Hades_019_f
Maybe you need a new perspective?

TAG: Hades_020_f
What? No. I need... I need to show that I'm better than everyone else.

TAG: Hades_021_f
Maybe I have a flaw... or half a flaw... but I'm still a better boss than the other dolts in this place.

TAG: Hades_022_f
What if you try to work at some of the businesses around here? Maybe you can pick up some management tips, see how others run things.

TAG: Hades_023_f
Okay. Yeah, I see where you're goin' here. Because then I'll KNOW exactly how much better I am than they are! I knew there was a reason I kept you around, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Because Pain and Panic are terrible assistants?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Because I actually know what I'm doing?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Because I have incredible magic that helps this land stay healthy?

TAG: Hades_024_f
What can I say? Both things are true.

TAG: Hades_027_f
Why don't you go talk to Remy for me? I'm sure you can convince him to let me run things at the ol' restaurant for a while.

TAG: Hades_028_f
I've even got a recipe for a Grecian Baked Fish that'll knock your sandals off.

TAG: Hades_029_f
All right, I'll go talk to him...

TAG: Hades_025_f
At times.

TAG: Hades_026_f
Do I look like a horticulturist to you? Don't care.

TAG: Hades_015_f
Even you don't recognize my innate management skills.

TAG: Hades_016_f
You're as bad as the rest of them!

TAG: Hades_018_f
I work my fingers to the bone in the Underworld and this is the thanks I get?

TAG: Hades_006_f
Really?

TAG: Hades_007_f
Because... you think that I'm MORE than skilled and inspiring?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Exactly.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
... No.

TAG: Hades_008_f
Yes... Good mortal.

TAG: Hades_009_f
I'm not a dog, Hades.

TAG: Hades_010_f
No, you're a mortal. And ya know what; now that I think about it...

TAG: Hades_011_f
NO?!

TAG: Hades_012_f
Don't blow your top, Hades.

TAG: Hades_013_f
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!
