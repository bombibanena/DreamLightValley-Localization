Okay Hades, I've got those resources for you!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Finally! I can't wait to get this place cleaned up.

TAG: Hades_003_f
All right, let's see... Your stuff plus a flash of Underworld flames, a few drops from the river Styx...

TAG: Hades_004_f
And there we go â one enchanted pickaxe! Powerful enough to make Hephaestus drool.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Who?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Cool!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What other potions can you make?

TAG: Hades_005_f
The god of fire and banging metal into stuff. You want a flaming arrow, he's your guy.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Anyway, I'm sure you've seen those Demon Snippets darting around?

TAG: Hades_007_f
Sure...

TAG: Hades_008_f
Well, I need you to get rid of them too. I know they look like they belong here, but they keep flying around the light from my hair.

TAG: Hades_009_f
Ever smell a burnt Demon Snippet? Not. Pleasant.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sure, I can help with that too.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You can't just... magic them away or something?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Yeah, that doesn't sound particularly appetizing.

TAG: Hades_010_f
How do I catch the Demon Snippets?

TAG: Hades_000_f
Well, they're sneaky little things. They like to run away from you a few times, so don't give up. Approach them carefully â they'll disappear, but keep it up!

TAG: Hades_011_f
Use that <Lore>Net</Lore> of yours, or <Lore>try out some traps</Lore>. Whatever works.

TAG: Hades_012_f
After that, you can make like an apprentice mason and <Lore>start clearing the marble</Lore>.

TAG: Hades_014_f
{PlayerName}... I have powers to guide the souls of the departed to their final resting spot.

TAG: Hades_015_f
I rule the domain of the dead. I am a god...

TAG: Hades_016_f
And you want me to use my powers to CLEAN?!

TAG: Hades_017_f
Okay, okay, don't overreact.

TAG: Hades_013_f
What am I, a vending machine? Focus on the task at hand, {PlayerName}.
