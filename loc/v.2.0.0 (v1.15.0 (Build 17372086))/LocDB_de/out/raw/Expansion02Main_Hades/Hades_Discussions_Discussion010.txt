It's all right. A little dark, a little gloomy, but... Hey, what do you expect, am I right?

The company could be better, though.

You get a lot of visitors down there?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You mean dead people, don't you?

TAG: Hades_002_f
What? No! That was a joke.

TAG: Hades_003_f

TAG: Hades_004_f
No, I'm talking about Mickey Mouse and all his pals.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Of COURSE I mean dead people! Keep up.
