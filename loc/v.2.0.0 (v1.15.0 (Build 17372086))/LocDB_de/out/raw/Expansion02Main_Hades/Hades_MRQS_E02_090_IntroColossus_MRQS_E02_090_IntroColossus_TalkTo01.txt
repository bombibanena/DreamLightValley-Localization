{PlayerName}, look, I'm a pretty patient guy, but...

TAG: Hades_001_f
...I've noticed that I'm not back on Mount Olympus yet, ruling over all I survey.

TAG: Hades_002_f
What's the problem?

TAG: Hades_003_f
I found a giant statue of you in Mythopia.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Ahhh, right, Colossal Me! That corner looked a little empty without a monument, so I commissioned it. Whaddaya think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's a great likeness.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's a tad much.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A statue of Hercules or Zeus would be cooler.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Right? Really ties the whole area together.

TAG: Hades_006_f
The bridge leading to the statue... it's not working. I can't reach it.

TAG: Hades_007_f
Sheesh. I forgot about the bridge.

TAG: Hades_008_f
It used to work just fine. There were even some vases of Pain and Panic on columns at the end to control the bridge.

TAG: Hades_009_f
But then I needed more marble to make the statue of me. You get the picture.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Now the bridge is... Well, let's just say it's seen better days.

TAG: Hades_011_f
<Lore>Find some marble</Lore> and fix it, will ya?

TAG: Hades_012_f
I mean, come on. There's no shortage of the stuff lyin' around.

TAG: Hades_013_f
I'm tellin' ya, mortals today have no appreciation for fine art.

TAG: Hades_014_f
...

TAG: Hades_015_f
What did you just say...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I said that a statue of Hercules or Zeus would look cooler.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Uh, nothing. Forget it.

TAG: Hades_016_f
Ah. Yeah. I thought that's what you said.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Little word of advice?

TAG: Hades_018_f
NEVER say those names around me again!

TAG: Hades_019_f
Am I making myself clear?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I think so.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Yes. Yeesh!

TAG: Hades_020_f
Good. Now, let's get back on topic.

TAG: Hades_021_f
The statue of me. What about it?

TAG: Hades_022_f
Good. Because I THOUGHT you said something about Zeus and Hercules.

TAG: Hades_023_f
And if you had... well, that would be goin' right on your performance review.
