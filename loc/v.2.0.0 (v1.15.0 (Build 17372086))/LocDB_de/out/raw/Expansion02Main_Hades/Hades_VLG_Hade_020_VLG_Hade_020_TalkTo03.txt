Fair, you see it already.

What happened there?

Sorry, Hades.

Hey, well at least I'm still getting a salary for this.

Ursula said when I was done, I should go back to her place to find my pay.

Cool, I'll give you a hand with that. I feel bad about how that went down with Flynn.

I don't get it. What did I do to deserve this?

Don't finish that thought.
