All right! Everyone's here, I've got catering, my DJ table... Let's get this party started!

TAG: Hades_002_f
Are you ready, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ready for what?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Probably not.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yeah! Fire away!

TAG: Hades_003_f
To hear a revolution in music-making! I'm about to outdo the Muses.

TAG: Hades_044_f
I invented a whole new DJ technique â I call it the smashup. It's when you play two songs at once.

TAG: Hades_006_f
Wait! You're forgetting something!

TAG: Hades_007_f
Oh?

TAG: Hades_008_f
You need to pick a DJ name. You can't just perform as "Hades" or "DJ Hades" â you need a proper DJ name. It's tradition!

TAG: Hades_009_f
Okay... any suggestions?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
DJ Hothead.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
DJ Sparky.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Hmm, let me think more...

TAG: Hades_010_f
Hmm, DJ Hothead... I like it!

TAG: Hades_011_f
It could say "my flaw is also my greatest strength" OR "I'm literally on fire!" Either way, I win.

TAG: Hades_012_f
There you go!

TAG: Hades_023_f
Well, you've got a proper DJ name now â is it time to start the show?

TAG: Hades_024_f
Absolutely! Ahem...

TAG: Hades_025_f
WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO A MOMENTOUS OCCASION â THE FIRST SHOW BY DJ HOTHEAD!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
That was amazing!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
That was... amazing?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
... Can I suggest that you keep practicing?

TAG: Hades_027_f
<i>What is that horrible racket that's beginning to emerge from Hades' speakers?! It sounds like he has taken two radically different songs and is attempting to force them to play nice together.</i>

TAG: Hades_000_f
<i>It clearly isn't working.</i>

TAG: Hades_028_f
Oh. Oh yeah. That's the beat.

TAG: Hades_029_f
Hades?

TAG: Hades_030_f
Not now; I'm busy! We're almost at the bridge...

TAG: Hades_031_f
Yeah, that's it! Wonder why nobody's dancing...

TAG: Hades_032_f
And now the drop... and there!

TAG: Hades_033_f
C'mon, was that amazing or was that amazing?

TAG: Hades_034_f
Okay, do you really think that, or are you just saying that because you want to stay on my good side?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
No, it's really good!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Well, the set... could use some work.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
No, sorry, it was terrible.

TAG: Hades_038_f
I knew it!

TAG: Hades_039_f
Why don't we see how the guests liked it?

TAG: Hades_043_f
Sure!

TAG: Hades_040_f
Unbelievable!

TAG: Hades_041_f
I know you worked hard on that, but the tunes kinda clashed with each other...

TAG: Hades_042_f
Sure. Maybe. Why don't we ask the guests what they thought? Then you'll see how wrong you are.

TAG: Hades_035_f
You don't seem convinced.

TAG: Hades_036_f
Yeah, sorry Hades; that wasn't good at all.

TAG: Hades_037_f
What?!

TAG: Hades_026_f
WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO A MOMENTOUS OCCASION â THE FIRST SHOW BY DJ UNDERGROUND!

TAG: Hades_015_f
Are you kidding me?

TAG: Hades_016_f
It shows ironic detachment!

TAG: Hades_017_f
No. Try again.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
DJ Antifreeze.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
DJ Underground.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
DJ Titan.

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
What were the first choices again?

TAG: Hades_018_f
What am I, a walking torch to you?

TAG: Hades_019_f
I mean, it's kinda funny, no?

TAG: Hades_021_f
No! Try again.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Now we're talking!

TAG: Hades_014_f
It says "I celebrate my background and I'm connected to my roots"!

TAG: Hades_020_f
No way. You think I want my art associated with that bunch of lurching losers?

TAG: Hades_022_f
Try something else.

TAG: Hades_004_f
Well, you're right about that. I'm about to forever change your experience with music.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Revolutions in music-making, make way for Hades!
