Heyyy, {PlayerName}. How's it goin'? Love the outfit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ooh, thank you! It took me forever to put together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Cut the flattery, Hades.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Tell me where the Clan DunBroch treasure is. NOW.

TAG: Hades_001_f
Then, let me say, it was time well spent.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Wait... you're trying to distract me, aren't you?

TAG: Hades_003_f
I'm not here to talk about my outfit. I'm here to talk about what you stole from Merida.

TAG: Hades_005_f
Ah. Red told you about that, huh?

TAG: Hades_006_f
Okay, so I found a note from Merida that said she'd hidden something in the Vale, blah blah blah, "change your fate."

TAG: Hades_007_f
Look, I've dealt with the Fates. They think they know EVERYTHING!

TAG: Hades_008_f
So, if I could get a leg up on them, change some things that are prophesied? That'd be pretty cool, right?

TAG: Hades_009_f
But, turns out, that thing Merida hid is a piece of junk! No power at all.

TAG: Hades_010_f
I've been using it as a dinner plate. You want it, it's yours. <Lore>Check my House</Lore>. What a waste of my time!

TAG: Hades_004_f
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why all the hostility?
