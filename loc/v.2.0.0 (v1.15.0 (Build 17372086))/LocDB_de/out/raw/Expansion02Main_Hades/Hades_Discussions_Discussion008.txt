Purely hypothetically...

TAG: Hades_001_f
Let's say you want to assume control over an area someone else is currently in charge of... What would YOU do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is this about Everafter and Maleficent?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd never do something like that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm not going to tell you that. Hypothetically.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Maybe, maybe not. She's bein' less than cooperative at the moment.

TAG: Hades_003_f
But that's beside the point. Let's look at the whole mosaic, the big picture. The entire spanakopita, if you will.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Running the Valley is more work than you think.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You said "spanakopita" and now I'm hungry.

TAG: Hades_007_f
What? I'm not after the entire Valley! I mean â your words, not mine.

TAG: Hades_008_f
You'reâ Fine, all right, go eat something.

TAG: Hades_009_f
You mortals and your appetites.

TAG: Hades_004_f
I mean of course YOU wouldn't â you're you! You've got that whole "protector of the Valley" bit goin' on.

TAG: Hades_005_f
But if you DID, how would you do it?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'd find allies.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'd use magic.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
No! Just no.

TAG: Hades_010_f
Yeah... Yeah. Always good to have someone who's got your back.

TAG: Hades_011_f
A couple of Titans might do it...

TAG: Hades_012_f
Right. Doesn't help me, but I get it.

TAG: Hades_017_f
Sheesh, all right. Message received. Lighten up, will ya?

TAG: Hades_006_f
Aw, c'mon! What do you think, I'm gonna steal your plans for myself? Is that what you think of me?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I mean, kinda.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'm just not villainous enough.

TAG: Hades_013_f
Whoa, trust me. I've got PLENTY of thoughts on conquering territory, okay?

TAG: Hades_018_f
... But if you DO think of anything in the future and feel like sharin', hey... Swing by and we'll chat.

TAG: Hades_015_f
Oh, trust me; I GET IT.

TAG: Hades_016_f
I should've known better than to ask one of you hero types.
