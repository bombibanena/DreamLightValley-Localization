Well, that... went. What'd ya think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They were both really good!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I preferred Eric's flute.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I liked Mirabel's vocal melody more.

TAG: Hades_002_f
Voice and flute seems like a cool pairing for a fancy event!

TAG: Hades_015_f
So, this "Dee-Jay" has god-like control over the music?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You could put it that way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I mean, usually the turntables and mixers help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Oh, totally. You do not mess with the DJ.

TAG: Hades_003_f
Hold on now. I seem to remember being at the same auditions as you...

TAG: Hades_004_f
But your reaction makes me think you hit your head, passed out, and IMAGINED they were actually GOOD!

TAG: Hades_009_f
No way those auditions were right for the electric mood I'm trying to create.

TAG: Hades_010_f
But, if you wanna hire 'em for a children's birthday party, go right ahead!

TAG: Hades_011_f
What am I gonna do? Who can I get to perform? A party isn't a party worth having without top-notch music...

TAG: Hades_012_f
What if you just find someone to DJ? Then, you could have input on the playlist and everything.

TAG: Hades_013_f
... Dee... Jay...?

TAG: Hades_014_f
Yeah! Think of it as... sort of a modern musician. They usually have a special DJ table with a whole bunch of recorded music. They control what gets played, when and how.

TAG: Hades_016_f
Well now, this is interesting...

TAG: Hades_017_f
Clearly, I'll be the DJ for my own party!

TAG: Hades_024_f
Head minion â <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.

TAG: Hades_022_f
What about Mirabel and Eric? Shall I tell them you're going in another direction?

TAG: Hades_023_f
Don't bother. What can I say? I like the idea of them tearfully waiting for an acceptance letter.

TAG: Hades_019_f
Intermediate minion â <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.

TAG: Hades_020_f
Associate minion â <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.

TAG: Hades_021_f
Junior minion â <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.

TAG: Hades_018_f
Yeah, yeah. This could work...

TAG: Hades_005_f
Really, {PlayerName}? I may not be the god of music, but I do have SOME knowledge of culture.

TAG: Hades_006_f
And that was not it. Sea shanties? What was he thinking?!

TAG: Hades_007_f
Sure, it was... nice. And it's not her fault, really. But one voice just isn't gonna cut it.

TAG: Hades_008_f
If she had, like, four cousins, some killer harmonies and a horn section, maybe.
