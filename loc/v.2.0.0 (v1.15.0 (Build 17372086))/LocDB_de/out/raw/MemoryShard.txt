I like to stand on the Beach and look to the horizon and wonder about what new friends may be sailing towards me while I wait.

TAG: Diaries!BiomeEntries!Beach002_DescriptionText
Sometimes I look out over the ocean and think about traveling beyond the Valley. I could find a whole new world.

There's this dark place at the edge of the Valley. Every time I walk by, it makes me feel all sad and cold inside. Maybe we could decorate it and make it a little brighter...

A forest is full of secrets and life. From the quick, quiet lives of raccoons on the ground to the busy flutter of the birds through the trees to the owl and wildcat gliding silently through darkness.

...no choice but to venture into the Unwritten Realms to find a way to save the Vale. Though it may be dangerous, I must do it.

TAG: Diaries!Expansion02!AuroraJournals!Mythopia!AuroraJournal16_DescriptionText
Merida said this all began because Hades and Maleficent were not invited to the council. Maleficent has always done horrid things when she is excluded.

While Maleficent and Hades get along, the Vale is peaceful but... changed.

Aunt Flora, Aunt Fauna, and Aunt Merryweather say there is only one way to stop the Neverafter. I must set out on a journey, and...

TAG: Diaries!Expansion02!AuroraJournals!TheBind!AuroraJournal07_DescriptionText
There is a skilled archer here with glorious red hair. She makes the impossible possible and gives me hope.
