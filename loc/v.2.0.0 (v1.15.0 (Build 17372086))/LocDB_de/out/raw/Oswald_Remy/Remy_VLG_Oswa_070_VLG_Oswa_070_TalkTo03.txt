Hey Remy, can I ask you a culinary question?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I agree!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I guess it depends on how good of a nose you have.

TAG: Remy_001_f
Of course. I'd be worried if you asked anyone else.

TAG: Remy_002_f
What's your question?

TAG: Remy_003_f
Well, Oswald and I are in a competition to make the most colorful meals.

TAG: Remy_004_f
How would you go about making bright and vibrant dishes?

TAG: Remy_005_f
What a fun question! And actually, I was just looking into this.

TAG: Remy_006_f
You were?

TAG: Remy_007_f
Well, you know what they say â you eat with your eyes first.

TAG: Remy_008_f
But I've always felt that smell was stronger.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Still, presentation IS key.

TAG: Remy_011_f
I suggest you focus on using brightly colored Ingredients.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Fruit is always a good choice. And have you seen those <ActivityItem>Ruby Lentils</ActivityItem> from Eternity Isle? They're gorgeous!

TAG: Remy_013_f
Great, that gives me a few ideas â thanks, Remy!

TAG: Remy_014_f
Bon appÃ©tit!

TAG: Remy_010_f
Ha! Very right!
