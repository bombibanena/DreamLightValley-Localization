Hey, Moana... would you say you're a fierce warrior who's good with a bo staff?

TAG: Moana_001_f
I think of myself as more of a wayfinder.

TAG: Moana_002_f
And I'm pretty good with a paddle, but I've never used a bo staff.

TAG: Moana_003_f
Huh... it sounds like you're not the friend that Merida's note mentioned then.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Maybe not, but I'd love to get to know Merida better. She seems really fun.
