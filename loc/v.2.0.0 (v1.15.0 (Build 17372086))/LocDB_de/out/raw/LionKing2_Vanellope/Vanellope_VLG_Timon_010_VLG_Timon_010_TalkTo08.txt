Howdy-do, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Hey, Vanellope. I just wanted to come check in on you.

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
Okay... What for?

TAG: Vanellope_019_f
I know you put an Anti-Lion Security Device in Scar's Den. I had to destroy it before anything bad happened!

TAG: Vanellope_020_f
What?! But what about Timon? He's really scared!

TAG: Vanellope_021_f
I'll talk to Timon. But I also want to remind you that this is a place where everyone is welcome... even the Villains. As long as Scar is behaving himself, we have no reason to worry.

TAG: Vanellope_022_f
*sigh* I suppose you're right. I'm sorry.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Have you spoken to Timon recently?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What are you up to?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Been hanging around Scar at all?

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Yeah! I love that little fella.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
A bit twitchy sometimes, but you can't really blame him, can you?

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
What do you mean?

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Well... Timon and Scar have a very complicated history. Did you know that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I've heard some things.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Complicated in what way?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Really? I thought they were the best of friends.

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
I mean, it's not surprising... predator and prey, always fighting. Not to mention whatever happened with Scar and Simba!

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
I know Timon feels a little insecure living in Dreamlight Valley with Scar here, too.

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
And that's why I'm gonna help him get over it! Don't worry, {PlayerName}; I've got everything under control.

TAG: Vanellope_023_f
I promised Timon I wouldn't say anything, but I'll give you a hint... It involves a net. But that's all you're getting.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Just, uh... maybe don't go around Scar's Den anytime soon, okay?

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Oh, you know, predator, prey, opposite ends of the food chain... plus all that stuff between Scar and Simba. It's pretty wild!

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
Could I get a little more "sar" with that "casm," {PlayerName}?

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
Sorry, sorry.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Oh, you know me â just helpin' out my neighbors!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Pfft, what? Me? Scar?

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Why would I do that? I've heard he's extra dangerous.
