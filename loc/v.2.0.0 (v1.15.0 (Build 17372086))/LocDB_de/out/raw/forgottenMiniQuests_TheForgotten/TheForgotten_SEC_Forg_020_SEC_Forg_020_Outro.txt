{PlayerName}, I... that was so...

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
I... well... I just can't believe...

Cat got your tongue?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Everything okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Take your time.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
Nobody's ever taken the time to show me how to do stuff like that before. You were so patient with me.

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
I'm really happy we're friends now.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Don't mention it.

Taking care of you... it feels like taking care of myself, you know?

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
I just hope I can return the favor someday.

See you around, {PlayerName}! I think I'm going to try to do some good deeds today and see how many people in the Valley I can help out.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
Oh! Say! I already helped Scrooge McDuck with some inventory at his shop the other day. He gave me this but... I think you deserve at least half of it!

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
I guess that's true, isn't it? Well, I hope someday I'll be able to help you as much as you've helped me.
