The poetry reading went so great!

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
I'm really glad you helped me out with this, {PlayerName}.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
It's funny... I'm starting to feel... not so forgotten anymore.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We'll need to figure out a new name for you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you want to be called?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Should I call you "The Unforgotten"?

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
That would be fun!

But after all those poems, I'm running low on creativity right now. I'll have to think of a name some other time.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
But one thing's for sure. The more at home I feel here... the more old memories seem to be coming back.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Like <Lore>Skull Rock</Lore>. I can't stop thinking about that place...

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
I think there's something important about it. Maybe... we used to visit it for something?

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Whatever it is... I hope we find out together.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
Thanks again, {PlayerName}. Oh! I have something for you.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
Merlin really liked my poem. He whipped this up for us... to help out on our next adventure!

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
Hm. I guess I haven't figured that out yet.

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
I think I need something that's more like a real name.
