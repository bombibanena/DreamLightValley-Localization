Hey! I got some great suggestions for your poem.

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
You did? Really...? Nobody laughed at it...?

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
Not at all! Here. Check out these new lines...

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
Hmmm...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Read the one about being a jealous ruler...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Read the one about being afraid of growing older...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Read the one about being exiled...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
What do you want to do next?

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
<Lore>I once was the ruler of all I surveyed...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
<Lore>But now I'm cast out and I feel so afraid.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
<Lore>Nothing I do seems to make the world right...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
<Lore>...I'll take the darkness if I can't have the light.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
... It's beautiful. Who suggested that line?

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
Believe it or not... Scar. He knows a thing or two about feeling that way.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Wow, really? I'll have to talk to him about that sometime...

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
I'm hoping this makes up for how he treated you.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Well... it's a start.

TAG: TheForgotten_029_f
I'm so proud of this poem now. I... I think I actually want to share it with everyone in the Village.

TAG: TheForgotten_030_f
Wow! That's a big step.

TAG: TheForgotten_031_f
I know it is, but... I think I'm ready to do it!

TAG: TheForgotten_032_f
Well, we could create a special place in the Village for sharing creativity, but you'll need a microphone for sure so everyone can hear you!

TAG: TheForgotten_033_f
That would be great!

TAG: TheForgotten_035_f
It shouldn't be too hard. We'll just <Lore>need some Amethyst, a Black Passion Lily, Fabric, and Iron Ingots</Lore>.

TAG: TheForgotten_034_f
I'll get everything, and we can assemble it together.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
<Lore>As I watch the clock tick and the sun rise and set...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
<Lore>I fear what I love, I am doomed to forget.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
<Lore>But I've never been one to do what I'm told...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
<Lore>I'll care for myself. Charm will never grow old!</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Wow, that's deep! Who gave you that line?

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
Actually, Mother Gothel. I think she's pretty nervous about getting older herself.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Whoa, really?

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
Consider this her own special way of saying sorry for what she tried to do to you with that curse.

TAG: TheForgotten_021_f
I can forgive her... but that doesn't mean I'll forget it.

TAG: TheForgotten_022_f
<Lore>It seems there's no place I will ever belong...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_023_f
<Lore>And all of my words seem to come out all wrong.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
<Lore>But I'll wait for an answer, I'll wait for a sign...</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_025_f
<Lore>And one day take back what is rightfully mine.</Lore>

TAG: TheForgotten_026_f
Wow! That's intense. Who came up with that one?

TAG: TheForgotten_027_f
Ursula. King Triton exiled her, you know.

TAG: TheForgotten_028_f
Oh! Really? Well, that would be a good conversation starter...
