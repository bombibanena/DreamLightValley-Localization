Wow! These pictures are so cool, {PlayerName}.

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
That giant skull... why do I feel like <Lore>something must be inside it</Lore>...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I've got the same feeling.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
There's only one way to find out...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Please don't go playing inside the giant skull.

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
I feel like... maybe when we were kids, we played inside of it or something.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
We'll need some <Lore>seating</Lore>... and maybe something <Lore>cool and artsy</Lore> to tie it all together!

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Great! Let's make it happen!

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
Anyway, I'm feeling a lot better now, {PlayerName}. And a lot more at home in the Village. I just have one small request...

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
You name it, and I'll make it happen!

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
I was thinking... I love living in the Dark Castle. It suits me perfectly. But maybe you could <Lore>make a space in your House</Lore> for me to hang out when I visit?

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
You're so good at decorating. You probably could tell from the mess in the Dark Castle... I'm not the greatest at it.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
That's a great idea! How should I decorate it?

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Well... I'd love if you could use some furniture that suits my style, you know?

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
Something sort of... <Lore>calm and elegant</Lore>.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
For the colors... well... <Lore>black and purple</Lore>, obviously.

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
It seems like there's no way to get in now. But maybe someday...

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
Don't worry. I don't think there's even any way inside yet. But maybe someday...
