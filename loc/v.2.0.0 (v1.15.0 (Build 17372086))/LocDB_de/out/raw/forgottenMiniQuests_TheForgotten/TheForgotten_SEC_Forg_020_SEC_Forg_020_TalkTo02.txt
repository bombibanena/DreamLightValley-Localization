Mickey seemed so happy to get those flowers.

That felt... kind of great?

Now I want to do something nice for EVERYBODY in the Village!

Let's not get carried away. Let's help Goofy first!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's a great attitude to have!

Be careful not to burn out trying to do too much.

Oh! Oh, you're right. I almost forgot, didn't I?

We'll need to make a <ActivityItem>Bouillabaisse</ActivityItem> for Goofy. But we should try to make it fresh this time...

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
I'll show you how to get fresh Ingredients. We'll need to <Lore>do some gardening and fishing</Lore>. Come on!

Wanting to help people is fantastic. But it's easy to burn out if you don't pace yourself.

Why don't we start by doing something nice for just Goofy, like we planned?

If you try to help too many people at once, you may get too overwhelmed to help anyone.
