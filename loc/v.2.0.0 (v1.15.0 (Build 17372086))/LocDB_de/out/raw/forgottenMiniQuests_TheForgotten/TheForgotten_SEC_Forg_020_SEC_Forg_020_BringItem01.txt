Huh? You're giving the flowers to me?

TAG: TheForgotten_001_f
Shouldn't we be giving them to Mickey?

TAG: TheForgotten_002_f
Exactly! You're going to give them to him!

TAG: TheForgotten_003_f
... Oh. I can't remember the last time I gave someone a gift.

TAG: TheForgotten_004_f
What do I say?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
"Here you go, Mickey!"

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
"I've got a gift for you!"

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
"Do you want some flowers?"

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
Oh. That makes sense.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
But... Wait... What should I do with my face while I'm giving them to him?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Um... smile?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Whatever you want!

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Okay... sure. I can do that!

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
Wait. One more thing. What if Mickey doesn't LIKE the flowers?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Trust me. He'll like them.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
He'll be nice about it.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
That's a possibility. And it'll be okay.

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
They're really nice flowers. Mickey will love them.

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Okay. I think I'm ready for this.

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Let's go <Lore>give the flowers to Mickey</Lore>!

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
If Mickey doesn't like the flowers, he'll probably help us pick a bunch more.

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
That's just the kind of neighbor that Mickey is.

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Yeah... yeah, you're right. Well...

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
Part of being friends is learning how to be generous with one another.

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
And that means we might make mistakes sometimes. Because mistakes are how we learn.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Right. The important thing is that we don't stop trying!

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
That's the spirit!
