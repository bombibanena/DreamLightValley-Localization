Hey, {PlayerName}, you are NOT gonna believe what I just found!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
I was spelunking in the deepest, darkest, and most dangerous dungeon in the whole Village...

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
...Scrooge McDuck's storeroom.

TAG: Player_000_f
You were messing around in Mr. McDuck's storeroom?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds scary. Must be a lot of stuff piled in there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Find any cool treasures?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Does Mr. McDuck know about this...?

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Scary? Nah. Exciting? Definitely!

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
And it was SO worth it. Because after a little bit of exploring...

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
...I found THIS!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
What IS this?

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
No idea. But I think it's connected to that network I was stuck on. There's a label on the side that says "<Lore>Valley Visit Station</Lore>."

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
Maybe if you <Lore>put it somewhere and turn it on</Lore>, it'll let you <Lore>VISIT all those other Valleys</Lore> that I saw!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How do I know for sure...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
This sounds dangerous.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe I should talk to Merlin...

TAG: Vanellope_015_f
Well, there's only one way to know FOR SURE for sure.

TAG: Vanellope_019_f
For once in your life, embrace the excitement of pressing a giant button even though you have no CLUE what it does!

TAG: Vanellope_022_f
Just <Lore>place that thingydoo somewhere in the Valley and try turning it on</Lore>!

TAG: Vanellope_016_f
Quite possibly. But I'm sure whatever happens, you'll just respawn at the starting line.

TAG: Vanellope_020_f
I... don't think that's how things work in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Vanellope_021_f
C'mon, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Vanellope_017_f
Seriously, {PlayerName}! Are you gonna go running to Merlin every time something weird and mysterious happens?!

TAG: Vanellope_018_f
Well... I have so far...

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Nah, just some rubies, diamonds, and a bunch of gold.

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Not even one lousy power-up or extra life.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
I was starting to think I'd never find anything REALLY cool, when all of a sudden...

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Of course! I told him I wanted to do some organizing.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Only now it's even less organized than it was when I went in.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
What can I say? I got distracted by the greatest discovery in the history of discoveries...
