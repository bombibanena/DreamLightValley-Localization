Huh? What's all this?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Oh, no. Did Anna put you up to this? She keeps trying to convince me that chocolate can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Come on, Kristoff! Look at how many different uses it has!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Anna is going a bit overboard, but it's still delicious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Anna needs to try some more kinds of food herself.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
I've gotta admit, you've made quite a spread here.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
I'll share this with Anna... For every one of the next three meals. Who knows? I might like it!

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
*sigh* Yeah, it does look pretty tasty.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Oh, she's always open to trying all the food at royal banquets. She's just never found anything she likes as much as chocolate.
