Hey, Minnie. I found this book lying around in the Plaza.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
I thought it might have been Merlin's, but it's got notes in your handwriting stuck inside it.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Oh, thank you! I've been looking for that everywhere.

TAG: Player_000_f
What were you doing with a spellbook?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Looking to become a wizard?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Looking to hex somebody?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did Mickey cause another broom mishap?

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Oh no, not at all!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
I borrowed some books from Merlin because... well... I wanted to find out everything I could about what happened to me.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
What happened to you? You mean, when you...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
...when I disappeared to the Here and There.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
I've been having some trouble sleeping. I'm just so worried it might happen again.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sorry you're feeling that way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You don't need to worry about that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'll never let that happen to you again.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Oh, thank you, {PlayerName}. But it's not me I'm worried about now.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
If I could disappear... then anyone could!

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Sometimes I look at the other Villagers and I'm frightened they're starting to disappear right before my eyes.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
I just know there has to be an answer somewhere in Merlin's library. There must be some way we can make sure no one ever disappears again.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
But I can't make heads or tails of any of these books.

TAG: Player_002_f
I'll go talk to Merlin and see if he has any ideas. We have to solve this.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I want you to feel safe here, Minnie.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
We can't have people just disappearing.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
The next person who disappears could be... me!

TAG: Minnie_014_f
You're so kind, {PlayerName}. And I do... mostly.

TAG: Minnie_015_f
I was trying to figure all this out without bothering Merlin. But you're probably right. We should ask him for more help.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
I'll keep trying to see if there's anything in these books that might be a clue while you <Lore>talk to Merlin</Lore>.

TAG: Minnie_017_f
Exactly. We must do whatever we can to make the Village safe for everyone.

TAG: Minnie_018_f
Oh, I didn't even think of that! We'd be in a lot of trouble if you disappeared.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Well, it's not me I'm worried about.

TAG: Minnie_019_f
I'm certain you wouldn't. But it's not me I'm worried about.

TAG: Minnie_020_f
Oh no! Even if I were trying to do magic myself, I could never put a spell on anyone.

TAG: Minnie_021_f
Well, unless it was a good spell â like being able to understand what kittens are saying. Hee-hee.

TAG: Minnie_022_f
Oh, no. Hee-hee. I think Mickey learned his lesson about that the first time.
