Ahem... Now that we're all here, we have quite a bit of work to do.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
There must be a way to cleanse the Night Mites, the same way you would a Night Shard. Such a cleansing would render them safe to eat for our... snackish friends.

However, while I research this, {PlayerName}, you must work with Timon and Pumbaa to capture every mite in the Valley.

What if the Night Mites make us forget what we're doing?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Isn't this dangerous?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do we have any defenses?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm REALLY worried about the Forgetting.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
There is some risk, but I have a plan.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Your Dreamlight Magic protects you â we know that. As for Timon and Pumbaa, they will only TRACK the mites. As long as you're the only one to handle the insects, it should be perfectly safe.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Now, go. Go! The mites are on the move as we speak, and I need quiet to work.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
A terrifying prospect for us all, but {PlayerName}, we are catching this early, before others start to forget.
