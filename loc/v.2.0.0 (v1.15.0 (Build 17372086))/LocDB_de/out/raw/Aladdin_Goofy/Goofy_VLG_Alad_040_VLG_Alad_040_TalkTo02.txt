Hiya, {PlayerName}! It is true you and Aladdin are buildin' a marketplace for the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Any advice on running a successful stall?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you interested in having a Stall at the market?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How'd you know what Aladdin and I are up to?

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Gawrsh, I guess the best thing to do is get stuff local, so everything's fresh!

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Oh, and offer lots of variety, so folks can get whatever they need.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Absotively posolutely! Count me in!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
I'll be sure to add one of your Stalls to the market when the time comes, if I can.

TAG: Goofy_000_f
Oh, I hear things around the ol' vegetable Stall.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Folks sure are excited about what you're doin'.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
And I just wanna say: Count me in!

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Great!
