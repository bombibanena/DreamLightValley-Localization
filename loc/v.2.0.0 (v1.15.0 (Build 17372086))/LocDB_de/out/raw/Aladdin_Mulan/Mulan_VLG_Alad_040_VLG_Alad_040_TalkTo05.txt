Hey, Mulan! Aladdin and I are putting together a marketplace right here in the Valley!

TAG: Mulan_001_f
Oh, that's right! Mushu mentioned you two were working on something big.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Any advice on running a great stall?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can we add your Tea Stall to the market?

TAG: Mulan_002_f
Well... I don't know if you remember, {PlayerName}, but we built the Tea Stall because I missed drinking tea with my friends here in the Valley.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
I love tea, I love my friends... So that's my advice: Make sure your stall sells something you love.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
If you have the space, I'd love for the Tea Stall to be included!

TAG: Mulan_005_f
I'll see what I can do. Thanks, Mulan!
