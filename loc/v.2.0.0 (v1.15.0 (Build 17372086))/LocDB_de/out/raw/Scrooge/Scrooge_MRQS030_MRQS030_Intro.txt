TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Oh-ho! You gave me quite a start!

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Don't you know never to sneak up on someone while he's contemplating his investments?!

TAG: Player_001_f
Oh! I'm {PlayerName} and...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're Scrooge McDuck!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm here to help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You don't have to yell at me.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Aye, that I am. You must keep up with the business news.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Though my business is in a sorry state these days. Just look at my shop!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The whole Village is in a sorry state!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's not so bad...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How did it get like this?!

TAG: Scrooge_019_f
That may be. But you cannae be hopeless about it. A true visionary sees opportunity around every corner!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
After the sky went dark, most of the Villagers skedaddled.

TAG: Scrooge_031_f
And fewer and fewer clients came in until they stopped altogether... But I cannae remember where they all went.

TAG: Scrooge_033_f
I know I stayed to take care of my shop... and my money, of course!

TAG: Scrooge_032_f
Then... Hmm... Oh yes, the Night Thorns blocked me in... and... I cannae remember much after that.

TAG: Scrooge_021_f
But like light glittering off gold, I'm starting to remember how the Village used to be, and all its investment opportunities!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Life's about more than money.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
I'd like to get in on this investment!

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I just want to help the Village.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Aye! Of course, of course.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
You cannae forget treasure!

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Oh boy...

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
I've got a deal for you, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
If you <Lore>help me make enough Star Coins</Lore> to put my shop back in business...

TAG: Scrooge_028_f
...I'll make sure it's stocked with everything needed to put the Valley back together!

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
I see you've already helped Goofy get back in business.

TAG: Scrooge_030_f
That was kind of you. I'm very fond of the lad, but he doesn't exactly have a mind for money.

TAG: Scrooge_035_f
When you're ready to invest in my grand reopening, you'll <Lore>find my sign next to my shop.</Lore>

TAG: Scrooge_027_f
Goofy used to have a <Lore>Stall in the Meadow to the south</Lore>.

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
I'm sure he'd appreciate any help you can give him. The lad doesn't exactly have a mind for money.

TAG: Scrooge_025_f
With the Royal Pickaxe you found, you should be able to reach the Meadow...

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
<Lore>Find Goofy</Lore> and help him get back in business. Then you can help me with my grand re-opening!

TAG: Scrooge_022_f
Oh, and I see you have a map there. Don't forget to use it if you want to find your way around the Village.

TAG: Scrooge_023_f
You'll need to <Lore>find a way to break the rocks</Lore> blocking the road to the Meadow. When you do...

TAG: Scrooge_034_f
Hmm... I could use some help, that much is true.

TAG: Scrooge_037_f
Perhaps we could come to an arrangement.

TAG: Scrooge_038_f
Let's hear it.

TAG: Scrooge_036_f
And nothing will help the Village faster than sound investments!

TAG: Scrooge_039_f
A community cannae prosper without 'em.

TAG: Scrooge_040_f
Got it.

TAG: Scrooge_020_f
Ah... an optimist. Good for you! Where some see hopelessness, others see opportunity!

TAG: Scrooge_029_f
Well first, those blasted Night Thorns appeared... Then, the sky went dark.

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
Are ya now? Well, I appreciate that.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
But you're gonna need a lot more coins to get this shop out of its sorry state. I'm afraid enthusiasm won't be enough.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Aye. Well, for that I'm sorry.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
But it's a knife to me heart to see the sorry state of my shop.
