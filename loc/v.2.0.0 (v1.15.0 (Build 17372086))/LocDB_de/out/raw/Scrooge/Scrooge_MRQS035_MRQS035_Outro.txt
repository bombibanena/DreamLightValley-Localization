We did it! Business is booming! My shop is saved!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
The front of the shop looks grand, but more importantly...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...Villagers know where to get stuff!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...I'll be able to buy lots of great clothes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
...you'll make a ton of money!

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Aye, you've done a fine service for the Valley!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Now, you've shown yourself to be pretty crafty, so I'm gifting you your own Crafting Station!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
But you better not think about going into competition with me. You don't want to mess with Scrooge McDuck!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Wouldn't dream of it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Sounds too stressful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
You better watch out...

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
That's good. This Village isn't big enough for two entrepreneurs with swimming pools full of gold!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. It's a pleasure doing business with you.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Aye, having money is a burden... but one I'm happy to shoulder on my own!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Hee-hee-hee. That I will. That I will.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Aye, and remember: For class and refinement, there's no better place to shop than Scrooge McDuck's!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Aye, I'll be swimming in gold coins in no time!
