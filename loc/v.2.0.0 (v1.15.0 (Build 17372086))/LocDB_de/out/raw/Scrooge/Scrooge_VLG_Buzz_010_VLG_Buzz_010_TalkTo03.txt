Aye, {PlayerName}, what are you in need of today?

TAG: Player_000_f
I need to requisition a <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Uniform</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's essential for my new role as a cadet.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's to help Buzz feel more at home around here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can you help me with that?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
That's a tall order, {PlayerName}. I haven't got anything like that in my regular inventory.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
You'd be better off wishing on a star.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
O'course, for the right price, and if you bring me the materials, I'm sure I can make you something that'll do the trick.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
First, you'll need to make some <ActivityItem>Navy Blue Dye</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
For that, you'll need some <ActivityItem>Blue Falling Penstemons</ActivityItem>, some <ActivityItem>Blueberries</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Coal</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Okay, I'll get you some <ActivityItem>Navy Blue Dye</ActivityItem>. What else?

TAG: Scrooge_021_f
In addition to the <ActivityItem>Navy Blue Dye</ActivityItem>, I'll need some <ActivityItem>Fibers</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
And a <ActivityItem>Topaz</ActivityItem> to pay for my services.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
That's a noble cause, but I haven't got anything like that in my regular inventory.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
I'm afraid it's gonna cost you a pretty penny.

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
But I'm willin' to trade with ya.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
That's not something I keep in my regular inventory.
