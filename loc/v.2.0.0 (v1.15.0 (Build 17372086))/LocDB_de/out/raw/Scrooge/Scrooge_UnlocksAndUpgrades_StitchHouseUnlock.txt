{PlayerName}, that wee blue lad is running amok all over the Valley. Isn't he a mite destructive?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
All that property damage! Och, my wallet aches just thinking about it.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
We ought to make him his own place that he can wreck as much as he likes.

Let's make a nice house for Stitch. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencySoft" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll come back later.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
A house for Stitch to wreck, so he doesn't wreck the Valley! Splendid idea. Glad I thought of it!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Now, dinnae worry. I'll have this done in a trice. It's urgent, after all!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Och! You dinnae have enough Star Coins for this property! Come back when you have the funds, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Sufferin' Scots! I'm not sure the Valley can take much more of this, {PlayerName}!
