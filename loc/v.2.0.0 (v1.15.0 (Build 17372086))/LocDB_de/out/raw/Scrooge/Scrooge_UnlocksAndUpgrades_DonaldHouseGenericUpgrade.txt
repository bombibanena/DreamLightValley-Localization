My nephew wants me to fix his House for free? What's next? Does he want me to live in it for him, too?

TAG: Player_000_f
Live in it? Like, you and Donald as roommates?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That could be fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
That would be a disaster.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Don't be ridiculous. Where would I store my treasures on a houseboat that small?!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
*sigh* Fine! I'll fix the House for Donald. But after this, he won't get a penny from me.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
And you and Donald will have to take care of the mess inside. It's a right catastrophe in there.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I'm not running a cleaning service, too.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Hmm... At least, not yet. Could be a profitable venture down the line...

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
All right. I'll help Donald clean up inside. Thanks, Mr. McDuck.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Of course it would! Where would I store my treasures on a houseboat that small?!
