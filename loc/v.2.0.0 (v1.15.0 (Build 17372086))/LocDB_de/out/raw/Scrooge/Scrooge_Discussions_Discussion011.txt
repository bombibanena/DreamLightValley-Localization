I've been reminiscing about my time in the Yukon near Mooseneck Glacier.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
The valleys between those mountains... they were so... so...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...pure and beautiful?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...clean and untouched?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...full of potential for profit?

That it was, {PlayerName}. That it was.

No fancy meal has tasted half as fine as the beans I cooked on my own campfire under the Klondike stars.

Before stock options and crop futures and compound interest, my tools were my gold pan, my pick, and my shovel.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
With those, I worked the icy creeks and frozen tundra...

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
...and earned every cent with my own two hands.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds amazing!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds like a lot of work.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Aye, that it was.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Sometimes I think more than gold or assets in banks or properties around the world...

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
...I'm richest in memories.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Aye, it was, but it was noble work.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Aye, there were plenty of ways to turn a profit.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
But I appreciated them for more than just that.
