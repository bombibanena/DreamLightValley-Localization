{PlayerName}! I've put the map back together. We've got all we need to find that TREASURE!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
And where there's some treasure, there's often MORE treasure.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
I'll give you a fine percentage of the profit if you help me...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'm ready! How exciting!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
I'm worried something will go wrong.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Can't right now. I've got to run!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Aye, gettin' richer is always exciting.

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Go see Merlin. He'll know what to do.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
Aye, you'll be back. No one can resist the lure of treasure for long.
