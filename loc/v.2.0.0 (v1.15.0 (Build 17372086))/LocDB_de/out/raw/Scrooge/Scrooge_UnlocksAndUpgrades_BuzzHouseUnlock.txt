Buzz Lightyear is coming to our Village on a top-secret mission. He needs a special mobile command center.

A mobile command center, eh? Well, I think I've got just the thing... if you're willing to pay me a reasonable price for it, that is.

Make me a command center for Buzz! (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencySoft" index=0>)

What's there to think about? You willnae find handiwork for this price anywhere but McDuck Construction. And I know, because I'm Scrooge McDuck!
