Mr. McDuck, Stitch is starting a band. We were thinking you might be able to loan us some sound equipment.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Loan ya equipment? Och, I cannae just be loaning a thing like that out to anybody.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Why, from what I've heard, that wee blue lad would bring it back to me in bits, if he brought it back at all.

Music will help keep Stitch busy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A vibrant music scene would help the Village economy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We could give you a cut of our ticket sales.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Aye, it would be good to channel young Stitch's energies into something productive.

Come back to me once you've made the <ActivityItem>Photo Backdrop</ActivityItem>, and I'll tell you what to do next.

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
Och, look at me. Getting into another business. I hope this is a profitable concern.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
I'll dig out some sound equipment for ya, {PlayerName}. But first, I'll give ya some advice to help ya make this is a profitable venture.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Ahem... When it comes to music, it's about more than just the sound. It's also about the image.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
You need to promote the music!

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Oh no. You're not going to make me wear a T-shirt and put up a bunch of signs again, are you?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Still sore about that, are ya? Heh, no, I wouldnae make you do a thing like that again.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
But you ought to get some pictures of Stitch to help sell his band.

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
Make sure you've got a fine backdrop for the photo shoot, too. You'll want a professional look.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Aye, that's true. It could help bring the tourists in. And there might be merchandising opportunities, too.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Ha! Why didn't you start by telling me there'd be profit in it?
