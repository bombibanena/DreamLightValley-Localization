Ahh... Another perfect day for business, {PlayerName}. And just what are we investing in today?

TAG: Player_000_f
Simba wants to make the Valley a little more relaxing, and we're only missing a pool...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I came to buy it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you have anything like that in stock?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How many Garnets do you need this time?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Aye, that's what a shopkeeper likes to hear!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
And I'm ready to make you a one-time offer.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
You can either order the <ActivityItem>Relaxing Oasis</ActivityItem>, or I can trade it to ya for some <ActivityItem>Gems</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
No need to decide right now. Take some time to think about it...

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Though, according to my records, you have enough Star Coins to order it.

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
But according to my records, you don't have enough Star Coins to order it. So, you'll need to find a way to bring in some revenue first!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
As a matter of fact, I do.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Did you really think I'd trade you the <ActivityItem>Relaxing Oasis</ActivityItem> for just a few <ActivityItem>Garnets</ActivityItem>? That's a pittance for such an item, {PlayerName}.

But I'm ready to make you a one-time offer.
