Well, what'll it be? Should I go to the trouble of hauling Woody's Carousel out of storage?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll pay the fee to get Woody's Carousel out of storage. (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencySoft" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not paying that!

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Fine. But it's gonna need a lot of spit and polish. Dinnae worry, though. I promise you won't regret the investment.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Once you've fixed it up, you'll see... there's something magical about it.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Och! You don't have enough Star Coins for me to haul it out of storage! Come back when you have the funds, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Well, come back here when you've come to your senses. A treasure like that's too valuable to leave sitting around gathering dust.

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
So, you're lookin' to build a place in the Village for the wee sheriff with the pull string? Aye, I think I remember him.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
And I've got just the thing in storage! It's an old carousel.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Before the Forgetting, Merlin helped Woody by putting all sorts of enchantments on it.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
That sounds perfect.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Och, but I'm afraid it's not a showstopper like it used to be. It's been badly damaged.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
It'll need some work to restore it. And with all the enchantments... well, I wouldn't know where to start.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Just take it out of storage, and I'll do the rest.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Certainly. There will, of course, be a wee administrative fee.
