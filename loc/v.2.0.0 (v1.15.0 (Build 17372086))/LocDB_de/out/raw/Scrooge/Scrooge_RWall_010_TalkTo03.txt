Greetings, {PlayerName}! And what can I do for you on this fair day?

TAG: Player_000_f
I need to find an interesting object for a friend, like...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
An umbrella.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A fire extinguisher.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A parachute.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Tragically, I'm out of umbrellas for the season.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Perhaps something else?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Ah yes! I do have a <ActivityItem>Fire Extinguisher</ActivityItem> for sale.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Now, I cannae let it go for free.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
But if you bring me a few <ActivityItem>Garnets</ActivityItem>, I'll gladly give it to you.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Och, the only parachute I have is made entirely of gold thread.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I'm afraid it's far out of your price range. Something else, perhaps?
