Curse me kilts... Hard as I try, I can't unlock my blasted safe!

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Ever since we all lost our memories, I can't recall the combination.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
I left myself this note under the register with instructions on how to find it again, but I don't remember the answers to the clues. Will you help me jog the ol' memory?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'd love to!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure why not...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sorry, Mr. McDuck. Not this time.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Thank you! And, might I say, you've a splendid attitude.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Now, everything you need to know to find my six-digit safe combination is on that note.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
You could work on your attitude, you know. Muster up at least a wee bit of enthusiasm.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Ah, well. I'm sure I'll solve it myself... eventually.

If you don't find something he'd want in my shop, come and talk to me.

TAG: Scrooge_033_f
I've just installed an on-demand delivery system so you can order anything in my catalog.

TAG: Scrooge_031_f
Does such a thing exist? I think I'd have heard about one of those if we had 'em here in the Valley.

TAG: Scrooge_030_f
Aye, that would make sense. But the answer is "blue."
