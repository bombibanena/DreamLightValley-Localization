Have I ever told you about any of my great adventures, {PlayerName}? Searching a Scottish castle? Hunting for gold in the Klondike?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What were you searching for in those castles?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you find a lot of gold in the Klondike?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Tell me something different.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
I was searching for a family treasure hidden in the McDuck family's ancestral castle in Scotland.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
The treasure had been lost for years, but I found it with an X-ray machine! There was also a meddling ghost, but Donald and I got the better of him!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
That I did! I found a golden rock the size of a goose egg. It was the start of my fortune!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I used it to buy land in Duckburg. And the rest, as they say, is history.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Aye, I'll tell you the story of how I earned my first dime!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
I was a young lad in Glasgow, earning my way shining shoes. My very first customer was a ditch digger with an inch of mud on his boots!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I scrubbed with all the strength in my small body and left his boots spotless.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
But he paid me with an American dime, which was useless in Glasgow! The cheat!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
I vowed then to always be honest in my dealings and earn my money square.
