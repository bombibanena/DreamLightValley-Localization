Truth be told, I wasn't positive the glasses would really work, but I thought it was worth a try.

Now, there's only one last thing to do... You need to repair the key so we can open the chest!

With a little bit of gold, you should be able to weld 'em together.

What are you sayin'? You want me to give you Gold Coins so you can repair the key?

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Sorry, but my fortune's not to be trifled with.

Go out there and prospect some Gold for yourself. I'll talk to you again when the key's fixed.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Aye, I suppose you'll have to go prospect some Gold. I'll talk to you again when the key's fixed.
