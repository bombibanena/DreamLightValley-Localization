Aye, it's working! Our hard work is paying off! The shop's been busy all day!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
We make a pretty good team, we do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Happy to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm doing all the work!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Better be something in it for me.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Well, if you keep goin' the way you are, one day, you could have a fortune almost as big as mine.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Here's a little something to hang in your House, as recognition of your investment in my shop.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Now, there's just one more thing to do...

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Let's give the front o' the shop a wee bit of polish. Just enough to say...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
"We have everything you need!"

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
"Come on in and spend all your money!"

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
"Scrooge McDuck's General Store is the height of luxury!"

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Hmm... it's a bit modest, isn't it?

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
But maybe that's just the ticket. Too much extravagance could scare the folks of the Village away.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Why don't you collect some flowers and use 'em to make Flower Pots to decorate the storefront?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Here are the pots you'll need to put the flowers in.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Aye! I knew you were a smart one.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Umm... The Villagers here are humble, salt of the earth folk. Luxury might scare 'em away.

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
On the other hand, maybe a bit of luxury's what will set us apart!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Work?! Panning for gold in the Klondike â that was work! You're just givin' me a wee bit o' help!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Och, you're right. I oughta do more to thank you.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Aye, of course there is! Scrooge McDuck always does right by his business partners.
