Ah, {PlayerName}. Did you know that Pride Rock is the traditional home of the lions in this Valley?

Unfortunately, the Forgetting left the place overgrown and in a sorry state.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
But don't fret. I can clear out anything dangerous... for a modest fee, of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's clean up that rock! (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencySoft" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Perhaps some other time.

Sparkle me spats! When I'm done with this place, it'll be fit for a king.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Och! You dinnae have enough Star Coins for this property! Come back when you have the funds, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Well, come back soon. The whole Village will benefit if we restore this historic landmark. And it won't be bad for my profits either. Hee-hee-hee.
