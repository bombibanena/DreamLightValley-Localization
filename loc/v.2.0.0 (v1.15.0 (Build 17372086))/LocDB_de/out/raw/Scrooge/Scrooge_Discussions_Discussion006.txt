Aye. Specifically, I consider myself an adventure-capitalist. I made much of my fortune searching for treasure, and investing it wisely.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Do you have some questions about money? I'd be happy to answer 'em for you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How did you get so rich?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why do you care so much about money?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How do I make as much money as you?

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
By being smarter than the smarties and tougher than the toughies! I'm not like some folks, born to riches.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I was born to a poor family in Scotland and earned every dime I've got!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Not like some who got where they are by cheating, and taking advantage of folks. And the more money they have, the more they cheat.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
How do we stop them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Why aren't you like that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Cheating sounds fun.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Och, that's a hard question. Money's a powerful thing. You've got to have rules about how money can be spent, and how workers can be treated.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
But those that get rich by cheating will spend to keep cheating. So you've always gotta keep your eyes open.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Aye, well... I've done some things I'm not proud of. But I like to think I've learned my lesson.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
I suppose it's my family, and the good folks I've worked with. I wouldn't want to do anything to change how they see me.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
What?! Cheaters are nothing but no-good, spineless, rotten apples! Trust me: Nothing worthwhile ever comes from cheating.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Aye, that's a fair question. And I'll answer it true. I was born to a poor family in Scotland. I know what it means to not have what you need.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
So, I know the real value of money.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Well, you have to work hard and be clever and stubborn, too. And it doesn't hurt to be lucky. But most importantly, you have to treat folks fairly.
