Hello? Excuse me?

TAG: WolfDoor_003_f
Wait. Is someone out there?

TAG: WolfDoor_004_f
Uh... I mean... <i>Grrrr... Who... who DARES disturb my slumber? Awooooo!</i>

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm {PlayerName}. Pleased to meet you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've got a question for YOU. What is this place?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Your growling and howling could really use some work.

TAG: WolfDoor_005_f
Hey, it's great to meet you too â uh, I mean, <i>your name matters not to me!</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_006_f
<i>Leave this place, or you'll be my entrÃ©e for lunch! AwooooOOOOooo!</i>

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No offense, but I'm starting to think you're not really a wolf.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Wow. You are the fakest faker I have ever met.

TAG: WolfDoor_010_f
<i>What? No! Of course I'm a wolf.</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_018_f
<i>I am <Lore>the Wolf of the Wilds</Lore>, guardian of these woods and servant of Maleficent.</Lore>

TAG: WolfDoor_019_f
<i>It's just that this is kind of an off day for me.</i>

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Uh, yeah, sure.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
A likely story.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
It must be a VERY off day.

TAG: WolfDoor_020_f
<i>Don't believe me? Well, look at the proof...</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_017_f
Oh, would you just leave me alone. That's right... <i>Leave now, before my hunger returns!</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_011_f
<i>Like <Lore>what large, wolfish feet I have</Lore>! I'm sure you saw the footprints I left outside...</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_013_f
<i>Or... or <Lore>what a wolfish musk I have</Lore>? I mean, come on, you can smell me from halfway across the woods.</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_014_f
<i>Or maybe you'll be convinced by <Lore>what a terrifying howl I have</Lore>! I'm sure you've heard me howling at the moon.</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_015_f
So if I could <Lore>find proof that your feet, your scent, and your howl</Lore> are all fake...

TAG: WolfDoor_016_f
...you'll stop pretending and open up that door?

TAG: WolfDoor_007_f
Honest, I don't really know â uh, I mean... <i>It's my den! Grrrr!</i>

TAG: WolfDoor_008_f
Seriously?! Do you know how hard talking like this is on your throat?

TAG: WolfDoor_009_f
Uh, I mean... <i>GrrrRRRRRrrr! How dare you insult my ferocious growl?!</i>
