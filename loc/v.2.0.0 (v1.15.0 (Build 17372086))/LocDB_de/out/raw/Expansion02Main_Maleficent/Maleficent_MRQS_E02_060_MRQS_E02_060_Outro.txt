... You're still alive?

TAG: Maleficent_003_f
And you managed to capture my pets. I see...

TAG: Maleficent_004_f
Perhaps I underestimated you.

TAG: Maleficent_011_f
These "pets"... Where did they come from?

TAG: Maleficent_012_f
Just a bit of magic I obtained from the Lorekeeper.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Um, excuse me?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You stole magic from the Lorekeeper?

TAG: Maleficent_005_f
Are you offended? Yes, I stole a bit of magic from the Lorekeeper, so I could bend this world to my desire.

TAG: Maleficent_007_f
You'll find that Hades did the same.

TAG: Maleficent_008_f
That petulant fool. Someone really needs to keep him in line.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
You're BOTH petulant.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
What you did was wrong.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Let's focus on fixing things. Not what happened in the past.

TAG: Maleficent_017_f
SILENCE!

TAG: Maleficent_018_f
I have given you more allowances than any mortal has ever been granted in my presence.

TAG: Maleficent_019_f
But my patience has its limits. Do not test them.

TAG: Maleficent_023_f
Fine. Let's stick to the problem at hand.

TAG: Maleficent_006_f
What's it going to take to get you to give up your feud with Hades?

TAG: Maleficent_009_f
I suppose if Hades came groveling to me, begging for forgiveness...

TAG: Maleficent_010_f
I might find a way to tolerate him.

TAG: Maleficent_013_f
I've met Hades, over in Mythopia.

TAG: Maleficent_015_f
I'm sorry you've had the displeasure.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
He's my kind of guy!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
He's really not so bad.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
You're right. He's a jerk.

TAG: Maleficent_026_f
Oh dear, I had hoped you were worthy of being my acquaintance.

TAG: Maleficent_016_f
The thing is, he's not too thrilled with you either. I don't know if he'll be doing any groveling.

TAG: Maleficent_037_f
In fact... he wants YOU to go to Mount Olympus to apologize to HIM.

TAG: Maleficent_038_f
He what?!

TAG: Maleficent_039_f
Ha. Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Maleficent_040_f
The audacity of that imbecile!

TAG: Maleficent_041_f
So after all of that... neither of you are going to budge?

TAG: Maleficent_042_f
I will not set foot outside this castle until he kneels before me and admits I am the most powerful being to ever live!

TAG: Maleficent_043_f
*sigh* ... I guess I'll have to go <Lore>talk to the Lorekeeper</Lore> to figure out what to do next.

TAG: Maleficent_032_f
But maybe if I could restore Mount Olympus for Hades... he'd feel more like an equal, and he might be willing to say sorry.

TAG: Maleficent_044_f
I highly doubt that will ever happen. But I suppose you have your work cut out for you if you intend to find out.

TAG: Maleficent_045_f
Because I will not set foot outside this castle until he kneels before me and admits I am the most powerful being to ever live!

TAG: Maleficent_046_f
*sigh* ... I guess I'll go <Lore>try to restore Mount Olympus</Lore>.

TAG: Maleficent_027_f
No, {PlayerName}. He's worse than bad. He's a hopeless fool who thinks he's brilliant.

TAG: Maleficent_028_f
Well, at least you're a fine judge of character.

TAG: Maleficent_014_f
I haven't found Hades yet.

TAG: Maleficent_029_f
He must be hiding on Mount Olympus... or somewhere else in Mythopia.

TAG: Maleficent_030_f
Oh, do let him stay hidden.

TAG: Maleficent_033_f
I would. But we need his help to solve all this.

TAG: Maleficent_034_f
Then I shall be waiting here, in my castle, should you ever find the braggart.

TAG: Maleficent_035_f
Bring him to me when he's ready to apologize and admit I am the most powerful being to ever live!

TAG: Maleficent_036_f
This isn't gonna be easy. I guess I'll go <Lore>look for Hades in Mythopia</Lore>.

TAG: Maleficent_020_f
Right... wrong... these are matters of perspective.

TAG: Maleficent_021_f
I did what I must.

TAG: Maleficent_022_f
Aren't you amusing? A mere mortal, trying to solve matters far beyond you.

TAG: Maleficent_025_f
I'm serious. We have to fix the Vale!
