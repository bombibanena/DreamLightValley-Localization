Yes. I'm going to make soup tonight. I'm deciding which spices to use.

TAG: Sally_001_f
Witch hazel? Or maybe worm's wort?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That sounds disgusting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What does worm's wort taste like?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I have a different question...

TAG: Sally_009_f
Oh, do you not like worm's wort?

TAG: Sally_002_f
It's rather sweet and warming.

TAG: Sally_003_f
I'd say it's a bit like cinnamon.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Yes?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What's witch hazel good for?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Worm's wort is a funny name.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
What about deadly nightshade?

TAG: Sally_004_f
Well, witch hazel is good for the skin. It's wonderfully cooling, like a midnight breeze.

TAG: Sally_005_f
It is, isn't it? It's a very useful ingredient.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Worm's wort adds a sweetness to any soup.

TAG: Sally_008_f
And it's good for covering other smells and flavors.

TAG: Sally_011_f
I only use deadly nightshade when I absolutely must.

TAG: Sally_012_f
Thank goodness I haven't had to in a while.
