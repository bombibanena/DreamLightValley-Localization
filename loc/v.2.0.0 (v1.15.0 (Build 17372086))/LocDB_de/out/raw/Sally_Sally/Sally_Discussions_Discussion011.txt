No. Not at all. I enjoy the rain.

TAG: Sally_001_f
Though I do like to watch from inside. Otherwise it would take me days to dry.

I wonder... Where does rain come from?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's science!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The clouds are upset.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Honestly, I have no idea.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Basically, the clouds get saturated with teeny water droplets. The droplets bump into each other and join together, getting bigger and bigger until...

TAG: Sally_006_f
...they get too heavy to stay in the clouds and they fall. Rain!

Then, the sun heats them up on the ground, they turn into tiny water droplets through evaporation, float back up to the sky and it starts all over again.

How fascinating. Have you told Jack about this?

TAG: Sally_003_f
Hmm... Well, if that's true...

TAG: Sally_009_f
...I hope they feel better when it's over. Sometimes a good cry can do that.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Perhaps we should check Merlin's library?

TAG: Sally_010_f
There must be something in there that can tell us.
