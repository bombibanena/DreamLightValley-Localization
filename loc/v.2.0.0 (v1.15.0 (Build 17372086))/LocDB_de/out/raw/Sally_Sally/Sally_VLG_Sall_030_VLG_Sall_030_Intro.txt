Hello, {PlayerName}. I'm hoping you can help me... I've been searching for a new sewing project. Do you have any suggestions?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's come up with some ideas together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm busy; let's talk later.

TAG: Sally_002_f
What do you like to sew, Sally?

TAG: Sally_003_f
Oh, lots of things.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Costumes for Jack, decorative bunting... and of course, I have to sew myself back together from time to time.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're so multi-talented!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Does it hurt?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's a little uncanny.

TAG: Sally_006_f
That's kind of you to say.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Do you have any ideas for a project I should start?

TAG: Player_002_f
I think we should talk to Minnie and Daisy...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
They have their own fashion line.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
They design lots of their own clothes!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
They're ALWAYS sewing something!

TAG: Sally_010_f
They do?

TAG: Sally_014_f
Yeah, I bet they'd have lots of thoughts on a new project for you.

TAG: Sally_012_f
I'll go <Lore>ask them if they have any ideas</Lore> right now!

TAG: Sally_013_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}! I'll fetch my sewing kit.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Really? I didn't know we had that in common. You see, I made this dress.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Oh, then I'm sure they'll have some suggestions for me.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Oh, no. But it can get tricky when my arms are involved.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Do you think so? I've never thought of it like that. Hmm...

TAG: Sally_001_f
Of course. I hope to see you soon.
