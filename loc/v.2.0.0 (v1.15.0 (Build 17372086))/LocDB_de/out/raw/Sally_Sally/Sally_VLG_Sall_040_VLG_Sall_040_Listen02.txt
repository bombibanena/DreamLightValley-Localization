Hiya, Sally! Uncle Scrooge and I wanted to thank you for saving us.

And apologize for not believing your warnings. We promise, that won't ever happen again.

Oh, I'm just glad I could help. I couldn't stand by and do nothing...

TAG: Sally_002_f
And that's what makes you a fantastic friend!

TAG: Sally_003_f
Thank you, Mickey. I wasn't sure if everyone here wanted to be friends. I know I'm a bit different...

TAG: Sally_004_f
And we love those differences! That's why we wanted to make a Halloween-themed meal to share with ya!

Oh, this all looks scrumptious! Thank you, Mickey!
