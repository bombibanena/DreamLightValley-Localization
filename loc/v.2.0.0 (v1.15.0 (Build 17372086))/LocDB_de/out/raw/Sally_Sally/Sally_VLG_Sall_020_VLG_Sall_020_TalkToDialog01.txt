This spot should work...

There we go!

What if it gets stinky with all that rotting material?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This is cool â a first for the Valley!

I can't wait to see how your plants do on supercharged compost!

TAG: Sally_004_f
Well, that's one of the reasons I wanted to place the bin far away from anyone's House.

TAG: Sally_005_f
But if we do it correctly, the compost should just smell nice and earthy.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Hmm... we have a lot of room left in the bin...

TAG: Sally_010_f
Why don't we add some <Lore>brown compost</Lore> to the batch? Things like dried plants and wood chips will help keep the compost balanced and healthy.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Sure, I'll get on that now.

TAG: Sally_007_f
It is? Well, I hope it's helpful to others, too.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Me too. Hopefully, the compost will transform quickly and turn into rich soil.
