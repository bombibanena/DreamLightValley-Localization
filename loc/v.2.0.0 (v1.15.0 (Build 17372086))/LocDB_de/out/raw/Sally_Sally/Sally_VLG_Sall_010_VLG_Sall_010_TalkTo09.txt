*sigh* It's never been so difficult for me to talk to Jack before.

TAG: Sally_001_f
Why is it hard now? What if this is a bad sign?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Whoa, slow down there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't think it's that serious...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Okay, that whole thing was awkward.

TAG: Sally_002_f
Clearly, you're both just feeling a little awkward.

TAG: Sally_003_f
But that's nobody's fault, and I'm going to help you both out, okay?

TAG: Sally_004_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. I'm getting worried that maybe we've lost our... connection.

TAG: Sally_005_f
No way! And you wouldn't be the first couple here that needed some help. Everyone does from time to time.

TAG: Sally_006_f
How about if I go talk to some of the other Villagers? Maybe they have some suggestions for how you two can reconnect.

TAG: Sally_007_f
That's very kind of you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Sally_008_f
That's what I'm here for! Now I bet <Lore>Daisy and Minnie</Lore> would both be overjoyed to give some suggestions here. I'll go <Lore>talk to them</Lore>!
