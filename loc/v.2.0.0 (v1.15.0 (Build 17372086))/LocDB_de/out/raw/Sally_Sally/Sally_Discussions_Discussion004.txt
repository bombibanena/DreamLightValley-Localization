Does this make you the Pumpkin Queen?

Of course, we didn't used to spend as much time together.

TAG: Sally_007_f
That's new. And really wonderful.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Yes, we are... Oh. That's still exciting to say.

TAG: Sally_008_f
"I'm in love." Such wonderful words.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Oh no. Like I said, this is all very new to us.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Jack and I are just enjoying spending time together.
