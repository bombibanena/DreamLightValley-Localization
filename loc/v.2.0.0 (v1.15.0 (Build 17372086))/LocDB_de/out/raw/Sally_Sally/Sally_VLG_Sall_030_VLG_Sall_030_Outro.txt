You put together a wonderful party, {PlayerName}. Thank you!

TAG: Sally_001_f
And I think everyone liked the quilt too... What did you think of it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I loved the design!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It brought back so many memories!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It certainly had patches!

TAG: Sally_003_f
Oh, I'm so glad. The Fairy Godmother and I really wanted to make it a tribute to your memories.

TAG: Sally_005_f
{PlayerName}, we talked about it... and we want YOU to have the quilt.

TAG: Sally_006_f
It's part of YOUR story.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Thank you, Sally!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm truly honored.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm gonna be so COZY!

TAG: Sally_012_f
Of course.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Now, I need to go talk to the Fairy Godmother about our next project: a pumpkin-themed quilt for Jack.

TAG: Sally_008_f
... You know, I never had a mother or a grandmother. Somehow, finding her has made me feel so... happy and whole.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's the power of chosen family!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sally, I'm going to cry!

TAG: Sally_009_f
I suppose you're right.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Thank you for bringing us together, {PlayerName}. It's all been wonderful.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Oh! I... well, I can't cry, but the Fairy Godmother says sometimes tears aren't sadness. They're just strong emotion. I hope your tears are happy ones.

TAG: Sally_015_f
It's our honor.

TAG: Sally_014_f
That's what we wanted for you.

TAG: Sally_002_f
I'm glad.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Each one is a memory you made here.
