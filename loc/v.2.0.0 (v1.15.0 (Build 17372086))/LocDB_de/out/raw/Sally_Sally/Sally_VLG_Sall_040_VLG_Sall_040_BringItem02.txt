Well, no sign of Ursula or her in-the-works potion, but I did find this...

TAG: Sally_002_f
A picture of Mickey?

TAG: Sally_003_f
Do you have any guesses why Ursula might have had a picture like that?

TAG: Sally_004_f
Well, one... but it's too horrible to consider!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sorry, but we're going to have to confront this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe it's all a misunderstanding!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What if Ursula is planning a nice gift for Mickey?

TAG: Sally_005_f
Yes, you're right...

TAG: Sally_007_f
Ursula and I were talking before, and she mentioned that pictures can often contain magic â magic linked to whoever's IN the picture.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Oh, well THAT does not sound good.

TAG: Sally_009_f
I wonder if anyone else is involved in this, or if it's just Mickey...

TAG: Sally_010_f
{PlayerName}... I see something...

TAG: Sally_006_f
Oh, I hope so... but I'm starting to doubt it.
