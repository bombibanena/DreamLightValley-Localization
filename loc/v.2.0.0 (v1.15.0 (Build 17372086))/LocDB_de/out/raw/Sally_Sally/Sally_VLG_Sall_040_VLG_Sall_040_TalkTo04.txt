This isn't good, Sally. We need to do something.

TAG: Sally_002_f
I feel terrible. This is all my fault!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No way!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're not the first to be tricked by a villain.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Let's focus on fixing the situation.

TAG: Sally_003_f
This is all Ursula's doing â not yours.

TAG: Sally_007_f
I suppose it doesn't matter. What matters is that we make it right.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Exactly! But how do we reverse the effects of the potion? I don't know potion lore the way Ursula does.

TAG: Sally_009_f
But Ursula did mention that your Halloween plants were central to her brew.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Oh! In that case, I think I have an idea.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Here â take this.

TAG: Sally_012_f
I'll try to distract Ursula. When you have a chance, <Lore>put this into her cauldron</Lore>.

TAG: Sally_013_f
You got it!

TAG: Sally_004_f
Consider it a sign of how good you are. You want to believe the best of all the Villagers here.

TAG: Sally_005_f
That's the most important thing for now.

TAG: Sally_006_f
Of course.
