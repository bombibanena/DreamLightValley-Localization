Well, if you wanted to have a little flavor of Halloween...

TAG: Sally_001_f
...you could put up some bat boxes or perhaps build a belfry to invite some new winged friends.

TAG: Sally_002_f
Or you could invite more witches. They're very good at helping you get into the Halloween spirit.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
More witches?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Bat boxes?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I love BOTH of these ideas!

TAG: Sally_003_f
Yes. What do you think?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I love this idea!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
We might have enough witches...

TAG: Sally_007_f
I'm glad you like it.

TAG: Sally_013_f
Perhaps we could sew them some decorative sleeves for their broomsticks as a welcome gift.

TAG: Sally_008_f
I mean, we have ONE sea witch and she's plenty.

TAG: Sally_014_f
Perhaps you're right. Ursula IS formidable. I think she'd fit in nicely in Halloween Town.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Yes. You can never have too many bats. And they're very good at controlling insects.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Bring on the bats!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Bats aren't my thing.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Hmm... Perhaps I'll sew them all a little something.

TAG: Sally_012_f
Bats wearing tiny hats might be quite festive.

TAG: Sally_009_f
That's all right. I'll keep thinking of new ideas...

TAG: Sally_005_f
Really?

TAG: Sally_006_f
Well, I'll look forward to meeting anyone new that you invite.

TAG: Sally_011_f
And Jack will love any changes that bring a little more Halloween to the Village.
