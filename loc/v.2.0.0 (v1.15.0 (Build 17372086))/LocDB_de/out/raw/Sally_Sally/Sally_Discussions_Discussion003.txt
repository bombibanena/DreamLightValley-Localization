Am I? Oh, one of my arm threads must have caught on something.

TAG: Sally_001_f
It's not that bad. I can fix it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Does it hurt?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That seems inconvenient.

TAG: Sally_002_f
I'll be fine. But thank you for asking. And for pointing it out.

TAG: Sally_005_f
If you hadn't said anything, my arm might have come completely unstitched.

TAG: Sally_003_f
No. Not at all. It just feels a little loose.

TAG: Sally_006_f
And I can fix it in a moment with a needle and thread.

TAG: Sally_004_f
It's not that bad. Everyone has little things they have to deal with.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Luckily, I'm handy with a needle and thread.
