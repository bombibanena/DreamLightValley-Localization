Oh no, Mickey and Mr. McDuck! They both look so...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Happy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sleepy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
In a trance?

TAG: Sally_002_f
No!

TAG: Sally_005_f
Oh, I'm so worried about them. What if this is all my fault?

TAG: Sally_006_f
I just wanted to make friends with everyone here, but now I'm responsible for them getting hurt?!

TAG: Sally_007_f
Whoa... slow down there, Sally. You had a premonition, right? So none of this has actually happened yet.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Yes... I suppose that's true.

TAG: Sally_009_f
So let's try to head this off before it happens! How does that sound?

TAG: Sally_010_f
Well, I've never been able to avoid the events of a vision... but we have to try!

TAG: Sally_011_f
Great! Why don't I <Lore>go warn Mickey and Mr. McDuck</Lore>? Don't give up hope yet!

TAG: Sally_012_f
All right. I'll try.

TAG: Sally_003_f
No, not that.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Yes!
