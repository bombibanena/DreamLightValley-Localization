Hey Sally, how are you doing?

TAG: Sally_003_f
Quite well, actually. I've made a new friend!

TAG: Sally_004_f
I'm trying to do something nice for her. Do you think you could help me with an errand?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure! Always happy to help a friendship!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Ahh, I'll try to come back when I have time.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Who's your new friend?

TAG: Sally_006_f
Ursula. We started talking about plants and potions and discovered that we have a lot in common.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How nice!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You should be careful around Ursula.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You sure she's not using you?

TAG: Sally_007_f
She was so complimentary about the herbs I grow here.

TAG: Sally_020_f
Sure, I'll tag along!

TAG: Sally_021_f
Might also be good to make sure she's dealing with you honestly...

TAG: Sally_013_f
HA. Yeah, I guess you two have similar interests!

TAG: Sally_014_f
So what are you trying to help her out with?

TAG: Sally_015_f
We're doing a potion project!

TAG: Sally_016_f
I said I would help gather some Ingredients while she worked on the more finicky parts of the potion-brewing.

TAG: Sally_017_f
But there's one plant that I'm having trouble finding more than one of â an <ActivityItem>Arcane Sprout</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Sally_018_f
I was about to go see Ursula to ask for more information on where to find it. Would you like to come?

TAG: Sally_008_f
Careful? Why?

TAG: Sally_010_f
Well, Ursula has done some shady things in the past.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Not saying she's up to something now, just... maybe be on your toes a little.

TAG: Sally_012_f
Well, thank you for the warning, but I don't think it's necessary.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Using me? No, we're friends!
