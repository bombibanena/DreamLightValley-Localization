Hey Sally, what's going on?

TAG: Sally_003_f
{PlayerName}, I was wondering... would you consider yourself an experimental gardener?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Absolutely!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Uhh, lemme go think about that for a while...

TAG: Sally_004_f
What kind of experimental gardening have you been thinking about?

TAG: Sally_005_f
Well, I've seen the lovely gardening projects the other Villagers have...

TAG: Sally_006_f
...and I thought it would be nice to cultivate some more herbs from Halloween Town.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Cool, what kind of herbs?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The deadly nightshade wasn't enough?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Do they grow here easily?

TAG: Sally_008_f
Oh, maybe some henbane, witch hazel, a little worm's wort...

TAG: Sally_019_f
Once it's ready, please meet me in the <Lore>Vitalys Mines</Lore>. The darkness and humidity levels there should be very good for a <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Sally_011_f
I tried growing the herbs myself, but they don't seem to want to grow the way they would back home.

TAG: Sally_012_f
Oh no! Do they need some kind of special treatment to grow properly?

TAG: Sally_013_f
Perhaps. I do know that the soil in Halloween Town is naturally more rich than the soil here.

TAG: Sally_014_f
After all, there are always dried leaves and things rotting in it. So, I thought maybe we could make our own <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem> to try to mimic that.

TAG: Sally_015_f
That sounds like a great idea, Sally!

TAG: Sally_016_f
Let's see, we'll need to <Lore>craft a bin</Lore>...

TAG: Sally_017_f
And maybe <Lore>Remy could give us some trimmings</Lore> from his restaurant.

TAG: Sally_018_f
I'll start gathering materials and talk to Remy!

TAG: Sally_009_f
Well, it's nice to have other flavors for balance and some herbs have other uses. Also, deadly nightshade isn't good for everyone. Besides, a few more herbs would bring more of a Halloween touch to the Valley.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Unfortunately, no...
