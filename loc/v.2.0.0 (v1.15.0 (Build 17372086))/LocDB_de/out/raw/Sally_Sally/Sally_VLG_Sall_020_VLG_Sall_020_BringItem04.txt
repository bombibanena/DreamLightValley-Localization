Oh... {PlayerName}...

TAG: Sally_002_f
Is it okay? Did I bring you the right worms?

TAG: Sally_003_f
Yes, these will do nicely. I think they'll like their new home. It's filled with worm food!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm happy for the worms!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Phew, you had me worried there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Better them than me. I like my home free of worm food.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Just wait. After a night in the compost, they'll be the happiest and healthiest worms you've ever seen.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Why don't you <Lore>meet me in the Vitalys Mines</Lore>? We can introduce the worms to their new home and see if our trap caught anything.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Sure!

TAG: Sally_005_f
Oh, I'm sorry.

TAG: Sally_006_f
*giggle* So do I. But we won't tell them that.
