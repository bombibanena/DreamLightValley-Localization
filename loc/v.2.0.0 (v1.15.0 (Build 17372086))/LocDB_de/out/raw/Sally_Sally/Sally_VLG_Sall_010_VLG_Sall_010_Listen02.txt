Sally, my dearest, I'm so sorry about before. I have the utmost respect for you, and I would never want to hurt you.

TAG: Sally_002_f
Thank you, Jack. I suppose we're both just a little unsure around each other after being apart for so long.

TAG: Sally_007_f
You're right. And to celebrate our reunion, I've made you this...

TAG: Sally_004_f
Oh, Jack! This is the most romantic thing you've ever given me... That wail is so chilling.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Sally, I care for you so much. Remember how close we were when we used to sit on Spiral Hill and gaze up at the night sky?

TAG: Sally_006_f
I do, Jack. I remember just how that felt. Like we simply belonged together.

TAG: Sally_000_f
Shall we get this date started properly?

TAG: Sally_001_f
I'd like that very much.
