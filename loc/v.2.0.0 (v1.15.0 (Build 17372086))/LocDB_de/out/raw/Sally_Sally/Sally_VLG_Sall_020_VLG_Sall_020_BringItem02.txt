There you go, Sally. One prime <ActivityItem>Critter Trap</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Sally_003_f
Thank you! Now we just have to place it...

TAG: Sally_004_f
There. That should help us find our troublesome visitor.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Do you have any ideas which kind of animal is after the compost?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Gotta be a raccoon.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe a raven?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'd laugh if it was a turtle.

TAG: Sally_006_f
That makes sense. I have heard that they like to dig in trash and rubbish.

TAG: Sally_015_f
Cool, I'll start looking.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Well, we won't catch anything by staying here.

TAG: Sally_010_f
I'm going to work on refilling the bin. Could you help me fetch some <ActivityItem>worms</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Sally_011_f
Sure! But... why?

TAG: Sally_012_f
Oh, worms love compost! They eat it, and that helps make soil quicker.

TAG: Sally_013_f
I'm sure you'll find some if you <Lore>dig in the Glade of Trust</Lore>.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Hmm, they do like to scavenge things...

TAG: Sally_008_f
So far from Dazzle Beach? That would be rather odd.
