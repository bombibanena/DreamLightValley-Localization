So how do you feel about the compost project?

TAG: Sally_002_f
I'm very pleased. Now that we solved the question of who was eating it, of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Still seems so gross.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I should have known Mike was behind it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hopefully you'll get enough for your garden soon.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Well, I wouldn't enjoy eating compost, but I suppose I see gross differently than you.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Now, I'll just grab the seeds I brought from Halloween Town and plan out my garden.

TAG: Sally_006_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Sally_007_f
I'm not sure I would have been able to get the <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem> going so quickly without your help... or figured out who was eating it.

TAG: Sally_000_f
And now... I can finally start growing my Halloween garden!

TAG: Sally_012_f
Soon, I'll have as much henbane, witch hazel, and worm's wort as I need.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Aww, well that's what I'm here for. Happy to help!

TAG: Sally_009_f
I'm so grateful. And here, now that I have the soil for my plants to grow, you should have the <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Sally_010_f
That's very nice of you; thanks, Sally!

TAG: Sally_004_f
I suppose he does have particular tastes, doesn't he?

TAG: Sally_005_f
As long as Mike sticks to our bargain, I should have some ready very soon.
