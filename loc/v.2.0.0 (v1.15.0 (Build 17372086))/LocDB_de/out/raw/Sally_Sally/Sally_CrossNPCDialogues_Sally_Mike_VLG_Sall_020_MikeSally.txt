Mike, you were eating the compost?

TAG: Sally_001_f
Yeah, it's great on sushi, burgers, salads â you name it! My compliments to the chef!

TAG: Sally_002_f
But Mike... I need that compost for my garden. My plants won't grow without it.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Wait... you're telling me you're NOT eating this?!

TAG: Sally_004_f
No. It's fine if you want a bit of it, but please leave some for the garden too.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Okay. Your loss. But sure, I can share!
