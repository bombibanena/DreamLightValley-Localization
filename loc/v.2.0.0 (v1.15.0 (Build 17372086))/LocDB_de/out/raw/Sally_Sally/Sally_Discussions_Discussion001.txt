I think so. I certainly get a lot of practice.

Could you make a costume?

Could you repair something?

TAG: Sally_001_f
Yes. I've made many costumes. Most of them for Jack.

TAG: Sally_002_f
I would offer to make something for you, but I know you don't need help.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Your wardrobe is already so impressive.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Certainly. I'm very good at repairing tears in... well, anything.

Please let me know if you'd like anything fixed.
