Well, that seemed to go better than last time!

TAG: Sally_001_f
It did! But we need one last thing to enjoy our date...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
More spiders!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Pumpkin carving?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
A visit from Santa?

TAG: Sally_002_f
No. Not this time. But thank you.

TAG: Sally_005_f
There's a <ActivityItem>Halloween Picnic Kit</ActivityItem> that Mickey gave me. I think it would be perfect to mark the spot of our date.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Do you think you could <Lore>find a good spot for it near the Holiday Tree Portal<Lore>?

TAG: Sally_006_f
Sure!

TAG: Sally_003_f
Not this time, but that's a very good idea for next time.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Oh, certainly not!
