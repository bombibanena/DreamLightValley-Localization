{PlayerName}, I'm not sure that what Daisy and Minnie have planned right now is quite right for me.

TAG: Sally_001_f
They're very talented, and I admire them both... But I should find someone else to sew with for now.

TAG: Sally_003_f
This place is so magical. I'd love to learn from someone who understands the magic here.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
The Fairy Godmother?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
How about Jack?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I don't knowâ Merlin?

TAG: Sally_016_f
Do you think she would?! She gave me a recipe the other day for iced pumpkin juice that was delicious.

TAG: Sally_017_f
And she and I have been visiting so much â I can't believe I didn't think of her before.

TAG: Sally_007_f
I'm sure we could find a way to combine our styles if we made a quilt.

TAG: Sally_004_f
And perhaps we could even get a third person to join us.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Would you like to quilt with us, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I thought you'd never ask.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you sure you want my help?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
LET'S START NOW!!!

TAG: Sally_012_f
I'm so glad. Now, all we need is the Fairy Godmother to say yes too!

TAG: Sally_009_f
Could you <Lore>talk to her</Lore>?

TAG: Sally_002_f
Please ask her about making a quilt. While you do that, I'm going to borrow a few things from Minnie and Daisy.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Certainly. With you and the Fairy Godmother, I'm sure we can make something quite interesting.

TAG: Sally_014_f
I'm glad you're excited. I hope the Fairy Godmother is too.

TAG: Sally_013_f
Jack is wonderful at many things, but I'm afraid sewing isn't one of them.

TAG: Sally_018_f
That DOES give me an idea, though... The Fairy Godmother! She and Jack get along so well because of her love of pumpkins...

TAG: Sally_015_f
Merlin seems a little busy for sewing.

TAG: Sally_019_f
Oh, but he and the Fairy Godmother are close...
