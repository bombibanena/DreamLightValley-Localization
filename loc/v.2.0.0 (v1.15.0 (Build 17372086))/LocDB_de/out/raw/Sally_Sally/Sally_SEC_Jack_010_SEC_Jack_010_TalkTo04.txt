Oh! I'm... back? Jack, are you there?

TAG: Sally_002_f
What happened?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I brought you back!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Jack brought you back!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Jack and I brought you back!

TAG: Sally_007_f
Jack helped a little.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Well, thank you to you and Jack!

TAG: Sally_004_f
I'm so glad that the spiders I sent were able to give you the message.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Such a creative way of communicating!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I hope you can use mail going forward...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Yup, worked like a charm.

TAG: Sally_009_f
I've always gotten along well with spiders...

TAG: Sally_005_f
I spent so long in the holiday travel path, I was beginning to worry that the spiders didn't get my message to Jack.

TAG: Sally_006_f
Thank goodness they did. And... Oh! Jack!

TAG: Sally_010_f
Oh. Well, if that would make everyone more comfortable, then I certainly will.

TAG: Sally_011_f
That's such a relief.

TAG: Sally_008_f
I helped a bit too.
