Thanks for sharing your vision with me, Sally.

TAG: Sally_003_f
I've had other visions before. Premonitions. But I'm never totally sure what they mean.

To me, Ursula seemed to be in the middle of an evil victory laugh!

TAG: Sally_004_f
Ursula's my friend, so I want to believe the best of her, but... there's something so sinister in the way she looked in the vision.

I hope it's just a misunderstanding!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I really am not sure...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh, she's totally up to something.

TAG: Sally_005_f
So do I!

TAG: Sally_008_f
Tell you what â let's go visit the area we saw in your premonition.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Maybe we'll get a clue whether or not this is something we should be worried about.

TAG: Sally_010_f
It looked to me like Ursula was in <Lore>some kind of cave</Lore>.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Let's go try to find it!

TAG: Sally_006_f
Hmm...

TAG: Sally_007_f
I hope you're wrong...
