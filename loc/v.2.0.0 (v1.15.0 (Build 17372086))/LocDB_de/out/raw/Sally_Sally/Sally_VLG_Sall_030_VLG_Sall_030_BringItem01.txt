What interesting items. I'm sure they'll make wonderful fabric for the quilt.

TAG: Sally_003_f
I already have an idea for how we'll piece them together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I can't wait to see it finished!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's next?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Anything else I can do?

TAG: Sally_005_f
Well, it will take some time.

TAG: Sally_004_f
The Fairy Godmother and I were talking, and we thought it might be nice to share the quilt and all of its memories with the Village.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Maybe we could make it an event. With food and guests...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What kind of food?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I love this idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Any excuse for a get-together!

TAG: Sally_008_f
I'm not sure... Could you <Lore>speak with some Villagers</Lore> and ask them for ideas? They might have some foods related to their favorite memories.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Great idea! Like a theme party!

TAG: Sally_012_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, I think this will be a wonderful occasion!

TAG: Sally_000_f
While you sew, I'll look into some food for the party.

TAG: Sally_009_f
I'll <Lore>ask some Villagers</Lore> if they have any dishes linked to good memories.

TAG: Sally_010_f
It's no wonder you and Jack get along so well.
