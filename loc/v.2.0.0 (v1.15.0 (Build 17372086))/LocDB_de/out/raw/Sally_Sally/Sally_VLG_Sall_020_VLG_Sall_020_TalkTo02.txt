Oh dear! {PlayerName}, look!

TAG: Sally_003_f
It's... knocked over? And all the compost is gone!

TAG: Sally_004_f
After all our hard work! Who could have done this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A compost demon!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I have no idea...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe a critter got into it?

TAG: Sally_005_f
Oh! Do you have demons in Dreamlight Valley, too? Ones that make their homes in compost?

TAG: Sally_006_f
Nah, that was just a joke â I have no idea.

TAG: Sally_007_f
What do you think happened?

TAG: Sally_009_f
I wonder if one of the critters got into it.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Hmm, so what's our next step, then? We need to do something to secure the Compost Bin.

TAG: Sally_011_f
Well, if it IS a critter, maybe we should try to trap it so it can be relocated to a part of the Valley where it won't disturb the compost.

TAG: Sally_012_f
Good idea! I can look into crafting a humane trap for our mystery critter.

TAG: Sally_013_f
I should probably include some <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>. A little magic should help the trap resize itself for whatever stumbles into it.

TAG: Sally_014_f
Good luck, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Sally_008_f
That seems right.
