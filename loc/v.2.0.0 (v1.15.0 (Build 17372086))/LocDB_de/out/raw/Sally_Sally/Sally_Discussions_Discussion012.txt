Do you enjoy sewing, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I love it!

I wish I knew how.

It's not my thing.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Really? That's wonderful.

TAG: Sally_005_f
I'm sure you sew very well. You seem to have a magical touch.

TAG: Sally_002_f
Well, if you learn, you can sew clothes, or quilts, or other things.

TAG: Sally_006_f
It's really very useful.

TAG: Sally_004_f

As long as it makes you happy and does no harm, any hobby can be wonderful.
