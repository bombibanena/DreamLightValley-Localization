Do you mean what's my favorite color? Hmm... I think it changes.

TAG: Sally_001_f
It's not black OR orange right now.

TAG: Sally_002_f
At the moment, my favorite color is white. The color of the snowy hill where Jack and I first truly saw one another, his face â especially when he smiles, our friend Zero...

TAG: Sally_003_f
Oh, but I'm getting carried away. What's YOUR favorite color?

Red.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Orange.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Yellow.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Something else...

TAG: Sally_006_f
Red like Santa Claus's suit!

TAG: Sally_004_f
The color of ripe pumpkins, or the bright, blazing sun in Halloween Town. That is lovely.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Yellow suits you perfectly â you're so cheerful!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Green.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Blue.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Purple.

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
Something else...

TAG: Sally_008_f
Ooh, like the color of a sea creature's scales, or a witch's warts. But maybe you were thinking of the grass and trees.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Oh, like the color of the sky here! It is beautiful.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Purple can be so rich and mysterious...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Black.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
White.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I don't have a favorite.

TAG: Player_003_choice_003_f
ALL colors are my favorite!

TAG: Sally_011_f
Oh, like cats and bats and the middle of the night. That's very Halloween of you.

TAG: Sally_010_f
Well, you already know why that's special to me.

TAG: Sally_012_f
I understand. It's so hard to choose, isn't it?

TAG: Sally_013_f
Perhaps that's best â you see your favorite everywhere!
