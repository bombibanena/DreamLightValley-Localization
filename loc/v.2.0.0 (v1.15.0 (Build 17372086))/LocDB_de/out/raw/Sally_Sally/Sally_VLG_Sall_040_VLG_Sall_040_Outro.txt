Well, I think we can close the book on that issue with Ursula!

TAG: Sally_001_f
I suppose...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you still sad about Ursula betraying you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Cheer up; you saved Mickey and Uncle Scrooge!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I know this whole affair was kinda intense.

TAG: Sally_002_f
A little. I really thought we were going to be friends.

TAG: Sally_013_f
You're a part of the Valley! That means I've got your back â no question.

TAG: Sally_014_f
Well, thank you. I only hope I can find a way to repay you in the future, but... I hope this will do for now...

TAG: Sally_015_f
Thank you Sally, but you didn't have to do this! Just pass it along. Happiness shared is happiness doubled.

TAG: Sally_016_f
Oh... I never thought of it like that. I'll definitely do so.

TAG: Sally_003_f
She seemed like an outsider, someone who needed companionship.

TAG: Sally_004_f
I wanted to be that friend for her.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Ursula took advantage of your good nature. That's what villains do.

TAG: Sally_008_f
You're right... But I still think everyone deserves a second chance.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}, for reminding me that I do have friends here who enjoy my company.

TAG: Sally_010_f
You helped me reconnect with Jack, sort out the compost bin issue with Mike Wazowski... Now we even garden together.

TAG: Sally_011_f
And you helped me create a quilting circle with the Fairy Godmother.

TAG: Sally_012_f
I... thank you, {PlayerName}. Without you, I'd still be stuck in the holiday travel path and missing Jack terribly.

TAG: Sally_005_f
You're right. And I am happy that nothing bad happened to them.

TAG: Sally_006_f
I just feel like I should have known better.
