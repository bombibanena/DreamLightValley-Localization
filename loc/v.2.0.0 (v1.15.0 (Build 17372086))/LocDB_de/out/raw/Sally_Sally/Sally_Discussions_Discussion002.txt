Oh. I don't... well, not exactly.

TAG: Sally_001_f
Sometimes I have visions that show me things that might happen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is it scary?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is it useful?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can you tell my fortune?

TAG: Sally_002_f
At times. Sometimes it's sad. Sometimes it's worrying.

TAG: Sally_005_f
And sometimes it's hopeful.

TAG: Sally_006_f
It can be anything the future can be, I suppose.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Not as useful as I'd like. Often, people won't listen.

TAG: Sally_007_f
But Jack promised the next time I saw something, he would believe me.

TAG: Sally_008_f
I hope that means I can help him.

TAG: Sally_004_f
I've never been able to command the visions.

TAG: Sally_009_f
But if I see anything that's about you, I'll be sure to tell you.
