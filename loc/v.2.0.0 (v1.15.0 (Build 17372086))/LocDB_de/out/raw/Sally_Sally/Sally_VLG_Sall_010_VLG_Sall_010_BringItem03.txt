One bundle of deadly nightshade, as ordered!

TAG: Sally_001_f
Oh, thank you! I hope you were careful when harvesting it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Made sure not to touch my bare skin with it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I live on the edge, Sally.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think my Dreamlight Magic protects me.

TAG: Sally_002_f
Good. My cloth is immune, but I wasn't sure about you.

TAG: Sally_005_f
Oh... This is just what I needed. It will make a lovely perfume.

TAG: Sally_006_f
Somehow, I always feel more confident when I wear it.

TAG: Sally_007_f
I'm happy that you're happy.

TAG: Sally_008_f
Now, do you think you could get Jack for me? He gets so lost in his experiments sometimes...

TAG: Sally_009_f
Sure! What are you going to do in the meantime?

TAG: Sally_010_f
Well, I need to make the perfume and get ready. And there's one more thing... I have this aching feeling that something's still missing. I feel nervous â yet excited? I wonder why that is...

TAG: Sally_011_f
Okay, while you think about that, I'll pay Jack a visit and yank him out of whatever science he's currently up to his neck bones in.

TAG: Sally_003_f
Well, I hope you have excellent balance.

TAG: Sally_004_f
That's good. I was worried.
