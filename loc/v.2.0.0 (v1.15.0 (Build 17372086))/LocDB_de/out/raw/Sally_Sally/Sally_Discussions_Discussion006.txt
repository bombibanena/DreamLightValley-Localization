Well, it's always fall in Halloween Town. I'm still trying to get to know the other seasons.

Which of the others do you like most?

I love spring!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Summer is a delight.

Oh, winter all the way.

TAG: Sally_003_f
I guess it's something about new beginnings...

TAG: Sally_005_f
That does sound nice.

TAG: Sally_002_f
The nice weather, the long days... it's just idyllic!

Green leaves on trees feels a bit uncanny to me. But I'm sure I'll get used to it.

TAG: Sally_004_f
Something about seeing all the trees without leaves is so beautiful.

TAG: Sally_007_f
Well, I know Jack loves the snow...

TAG: Sally_008_f
All the seasons do seem to have their own joys. I look forward to enjoying them.
