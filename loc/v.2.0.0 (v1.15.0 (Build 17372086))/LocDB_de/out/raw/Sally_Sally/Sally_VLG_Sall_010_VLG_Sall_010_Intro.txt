Hey Sally, what's up?

TAG: Sally_004_f
Well, I was hoping... now that I'm back... that I could reconnect with Jack.

TAG: Sally_002_f
But it's been so long... Do you think you could help me plan a special date for us?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I would be delighted!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
In the middle of something, but I'll come back later!

TAG: Sally_006_f
Try to avoid touching them with your bare hands. It can be poisonous to some.

TAG: Sally_005_f
So how can I help?

TAG: Sally_007_f
It's been AGES since Jack and I had a proper date...

TAG: Sally_008_f
And I missed him terribly. But... I'm a little hesitant. I spent so much time alone that I feel awkward around others again.

TAG: Sally_009_f
Ahhh, no problem; let's get your gothic groove back!

TAG: Sally_010_f
Is there something that made you feel more confident in the past?

TAG: Sally_000_f
Well, I do always feel better when I wear deadly nightshade perfume. But I've had trouble growing deadly nightshade here. There's something about the soil...

TAG: Sally_001_f
I can give you a hand with that!

TAG: Sally_013_f
Oh, thank you, {PlayerName}! Once planted, the deadly nightshade seedlings should take about 15 minutes to properly sprout.
