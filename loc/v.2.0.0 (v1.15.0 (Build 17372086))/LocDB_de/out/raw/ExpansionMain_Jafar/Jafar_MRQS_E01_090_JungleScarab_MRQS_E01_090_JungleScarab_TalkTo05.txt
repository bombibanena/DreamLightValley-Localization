Finally! My plan has reached fruition.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
The Jewel of Time is nearly in our grasp.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
We are very close to putting right all that threatens Eternity Isle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I got this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're welcome.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I feel like I did all the work.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Your confidence is... reassuring.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
However, before you venture forth, it is important that I pass along the following information:

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Only a Diamond in the Rough may enter my vault.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
What does that even mean?

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
Poor Gaston.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
No matter what their manner of speaking or dress... only the pure of heart may enter.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Jafar, I'll be able to get in, right?

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, false modesty does not become you.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Touch the two pieces of the Scarab Key together, and it will lead you to my vault.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
That's quite the security system...

TAG: Jafar_024_f
The Jewel of Time is priceless, {PlayerName}. I must keep it protected.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
All right, I'll tell Gaston the bad news and be off.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Do not let his disappointment distract you.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
You want approval after every step? How tiring.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
You could not be more wrong. After all, I have guided your every move.
