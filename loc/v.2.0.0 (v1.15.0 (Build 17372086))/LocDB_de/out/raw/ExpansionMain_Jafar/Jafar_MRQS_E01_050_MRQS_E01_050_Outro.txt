Do you see now, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Jafar_007_f
What lies before you was once nothing but barren desert.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
But with the magic artifacts of Eternity Isle, <Lore>half of it was transformed into a lush jungle</Lore> at my command!

TAG: Jafar_016_f
However, now it is split down the middle by a rift in time that threatens to destroy everything!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I won't let that happen.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't wait to explore this place.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
So... you're saying this is all your fault?

TAG: Jafar_017_f
That note of determination in your voice... I chose well when I sought your aid, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
You will need determination if you are to have any hope of reaching me.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
The Time Rift in the middle of the Island has left me trapped in the palace at the other end.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
How am I supposed to get to you with this <Lore>broken bridge</Lore> blocking the way?

TAG: Jafar_025_f
You must obtain an ancient Relic known as <Lore>the Royal Hourglass</Lore>!

TAG: Jafar_010_f
It is under the protection of that <Lore>flying metal nuisance</Lore>. You must find a way to get it from her.

TAG: Player_001_f
This metal nuisance...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Where can I find her?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who is she?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Is she dangerous...?

TAG: Jafar_026_f
She is here, somewhere, in Ancient's Landing. <Lore>Search for her</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Perhaps she will trust you and simply hand the Hourglass over.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
You may <Lore>have to use your Pickaxe</Lore> to clear away the <ActivityItem>Copper Rocks</ActivityItem> blocking the way.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Oh, and {PlayerName}? When you find that metal pest...

TAG: Jafar_005_f
...do take care. She has a nasty habit of blasting things to shreds.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
I have no idea what she calls herself. Only that she has been a thorn in my side since the day I arrived.

TAG: Jafar_027_f
She almost reminds me of a certain street rat... never knowing her proper place.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Dangerous? Most certainly. She has been a thorn in my side since the day I arrived.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Yes, there is much to explore. But also dangers to encounter.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
Take it from me; the magic of Eternity Isle is like a tiger that turns to bite you when you grab its tail.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
MY fault? Hardly. This island, and the relics scattered about it... why, they practically have a mind of their own!
