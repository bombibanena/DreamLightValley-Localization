Ah-ha! It worked! At last! It worked.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
After *bzzzt* ... an eternity!

TAG: Jafar_019_f
*bzzzt* {PlayerName}? *bzzzt* ...do you... hear me?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How do you know my name?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're sounding a little fuzzy...

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Well, you may not remember me... but I most assuredly remember you.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
These crude devices allow me to speak with you, but I'm afraid they are not without their... malfunctions.

TAG: Jafar_038_f
Ah, at last! Our connection seems to be stable!

TAG: Jafar_026_f
Greetings. I am Jafar... Royal Vizier of Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Jafar_027_f
Before the Forgetting, I was your closest, most trusted advisor.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sooo... we're gonna be, like, best friends?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm listening... What's going on?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't trust you one bit.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
... Friends? Perhaps.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
But I will aid you however I can. And trust me... you will need my aid, direly.

TAG: Jafar_029_f
I reach out to you now with a grave warning... <Lore>All of time and space is in peril</Lore>.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Well, that sounds bad.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Er... could you elaborate?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Okay. How do I fix it?

TAG: Jafar_036_f
Listen closely to my tale, and then I will tell you how to set the world right...

TAG: Jafar_039_f
But now, at last, I've found a way to communicate with you.

TAG: Jafar_040_f
If we have any hope of saving Dreamlight Valley... you must <Lore>venture to Eternity Isle and free me</Lore>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
How did you discover Eternity Isle?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
These ancient relics that control time... tell me more.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'm ready. How do I get to Eternity Isle?

TAG: Jafar_044_f
It was fate... or perhaps a fortuitous accident.

TAG: Jafar_042_f
During the Forgetting, I began to assume my most-deserved role as sultan of Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Jafar_043_f
All I wanted was to restore order, of course.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
I somehow doubt that.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
Somebody needed to take charge around here.

TAG: Jafar_046_f
Ugh. You sound just like that street rat Aladdin and incompetent Genie.

TAG: Jafar_045_f
They refused to trust me, even though I was clearly the rightful ruler. They cast me out. Exiled me!

TAG: Jafar_048_f
But as luck would have it... I found myself cast away on Eternity Isle. An island full of ancient treasures and powerful relics.

TAG: Jafar_047_f
Precisely. If only Aladdin and Genie had seen it that way.

TAG: Jafar_051_f
It seems Eternity Isle was once home to an ancient civilization.

TAG: Jafar_052_f
They studied the secrets of time and space... and filled the Island with treasures and wonders.

TAG: Jafar_053_f
You will no doubt find some of them on your journeys across the Isle.

TAG: Player_006_f
Being able to control time and space...

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
Sounds like a big responsibility.

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
Imagine, being able to fix your past mistakes?

TAG: Player_006_choice_002_f
I would be unstoppable!

TAG: Jafar_054_f
Yes, only someone possessing infinite wisdom could handle it.

TAG: Jafar_055_f
Someone like... oh... a Royal Vizier, perhaps.

TAG: Jafar_056_f
There is certainly one mistake I would like to fix.

TAG: Jafar_057_f
That wretched Aladdin.

TAG: Jafar_058_f
Ah, I knew you were not some fool who would waste a genie's wish on something frivolous. Good!

TAG: Jafar_059_f
Only absolute power will do.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
I will send a means of transportation to you...

TAG: Jafar_001_f
It shall be waiting at the <Lore>Stardust Port</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_061_f
Take the <ActivityItem>Ancient Vessel</ActivityItem> and <Lore>travel to Eternity Isle</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Once you reach the Island, look for another <Lore>Mysterious Device just like this one</Lore>. They will allow us to communicate.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Where will I find this "means of transportation"?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
There is a port of many worlds hidden here. There, you will find the <ActivityItem>Ancient Vessel</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jafar_060_f
Visit the wizard, Merlin. He must remember by now. The old fool always was sharper than he seemed.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Oh, but you really have no choice. The stakes are far too high.

TAG: Jafar_028_f
Before the Forgetting, I was the Old Ruler's most trusted advisor.

TAG: Jafar_041_f
It seems you rule the Valley now. I hope I may provide you with the same wise counsel.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
You may not know me... but I most assuredly know you. I have eyes everywhere.

TAG: Jafar_031_f
During the Forgetting, I set out on a journey and <Lore>discovered a land beyond the waters of Dreamlight Valley</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_033_f
But then everything went wrong.

TAG: Jafar_034_f
A land called... <Lore>Eternity Isle</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_037_f
Eternity Isle became lost in time... and I became trapped there.

TAG: Jafar_032_f
