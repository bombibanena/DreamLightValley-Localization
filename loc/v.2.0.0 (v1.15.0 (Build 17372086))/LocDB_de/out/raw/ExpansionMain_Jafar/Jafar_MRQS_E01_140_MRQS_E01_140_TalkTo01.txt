Ahh! You found all three <ActivityItem>Jewels of Time</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
It took you long enough. I have been waiting for an eternity!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Clever play on words!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hey! I'm risking my neck for you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Would you like to wait for ANOTHER eternity?

TAG: Jafar_002_f
We have no more time for cleverness.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
You must remove the <ActivityItem>Time Anomaly</ActivityItem> from the palace and free me from this place!

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I see you've cleared away the <ActivityItem>Time Anomaly</ActivityItem> blocking your path through the desert. You should have no trouble reaching me!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Once you reach the palace, simply <Lore>focus the magic of your Hourglass</Lore> on the wound in time in front of the palace door.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Oh, and do hurry. Your reward awaits.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Your eternal reward...

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Your path through the desert is still blocked...

TAG: Jafar_015_f
You must <Lore>make a path by clearing away the Time Anomalies that block the Borderlands in the Dunes</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Only then will you be able to free me.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
It is not me you are risking anything for. All of time and space is on the line.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Oh my. Is that a threat?

TAG: Jafar_005_f
No... but a thank-you would be nice.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Do not worry. Your reward awaits you once you remove the <ActivityItem>Time Anomaly</ActivityItem> from the palace and free me from this place!
