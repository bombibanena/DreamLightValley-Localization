Ah, {PlayerName}, there you are. Good.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
As you can see, the <Lore>Ancient Gate is closed</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
There used to be a <ActivityItem>Sphere</ActivityItem> here that powered the gate, allowing it to open.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
It looked <Lore>just like the other blue spheres around the gate</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
But alas, it has been broken and the pieces scattered to the wind.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
All thanks to that <Lore>flying, chirping metal nuisance</Lore>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Metal nuisance?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe I can fix it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Wait. Am I going to be attacked by an angry robot?

TAG: Jafar_007_f
That is a story for another time.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
The pieces of the <ActivityItem>Ancient Sphere</ActivityItem> must be in the vicinity.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
<Lore>Search Ancient's Landing</Lore> for the pieces. You will find a <ActivityItem>Crafting Station</ActivityItem> here where you can repair it.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Then place the <ActivityItem>Ancient Sphere</ActivityItem> in the gate to open it.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
I guess while I'm looking for those, I should <Lore>explore around here</Lore> and start <Lore>making it a home</Lore>...

TAG: Jafar_001_f
It looks like Mr. McDuck once tried to set up a store here...

TAG: Jafar_009_f
And is that one of Goofy's Stalls?!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
I'll have to <Lore>check everything out</Lore>. Looks like other Villagers are already starting to come visit!

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Watch your step if you stumble upon her, {PlayerName}. But for now, you should be safe.
