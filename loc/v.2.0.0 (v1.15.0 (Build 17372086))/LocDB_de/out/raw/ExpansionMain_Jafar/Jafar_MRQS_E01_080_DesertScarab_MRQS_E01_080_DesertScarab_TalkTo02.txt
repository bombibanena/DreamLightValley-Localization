I see that you have acquired one half of my Scarab.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
YOUR Scarab?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Were you... watching me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yup! Only had to deal with a socially starved Gaston for a while.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Yes â I did create it, after all.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Yeah... We found it while we were searching for the Scarab piece. I think it's kind of sweet, actually.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
It is possible that now, with company, he will be of greater service.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
The second half of the Scarab remains to be found, and Gaston may be of help to you yet.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Do not limit your search to the Glittering Dunes. After all, the lush jungle to the east used to be a desert.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
All right, I'll <Lore>check back in with Gaston</Lore> and get back to my search.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I commend you on your progress, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
There may be reason to hope we will avert catastrophe after all.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Why didn't you tell me that the Jewel of Time was in some secret vault full of treasures?

TAG: Jafar_023_f
Perhaps I wanted to test your mettle.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Though I had hoped Gaston would have done most of the work for you, and it would be as simple as taking the Scarab Key from him.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
I charged Gaston with this task some time ago, and clearly, the fool made no progress.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Honestly, I think he was too lonely to be productive. He recreated his friend out of coconuts.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
... Coconuts?

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Perhaps.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Perhaps I have certain devices keyed into the magical aura of the Scarab that alert me when it comes into contact with Dreamlight Magic.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
I think I will let you wonder... Now...

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Yes... You have my sympathies.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
That being said, he's gotten really good at arts and crafts.
