Well? Where is the <ActivityItem>Royal Hourglass</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Don't tell me that chirping little contraption scared you off and you have given up already?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
She's not a "contraption." Her name is EVE.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Actually, that's exactly what happened.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
I do not care what her name is. I only care that she is standing in our way!

TAG: Jafar_015_f
I don't think she's going to give me that Hourglass unless I gain her trust.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
I wonder why she's so determined to protect it...

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Isn't it obvious?

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Loyalty!

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Someone she DOES trust asked her to watch over it. And she has guarded it ever since.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
And that someone was... you.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Me?!

TAG: Jafar_023_f
That is right, {PlayerName}. This is not your first time on Eternity Isle.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Ages ago, you and that creature found the Hourglass. But you feared its power and asked her to guard over it until you decided what to do with it.

TAG: Jafar_028_f
She will not hand that Hourglass over to anyone but you.

TAG: Jafar_026_f
I must have been just a kid. She doesn't recognize me anymore. If only there was some way to convince her it's me...

TAG: Jafar_030_f
Her home is here in Ancient's Landing. I suggest you <Lore>search it</Lore> for something to use to convince her...

TAG: Jafar_021_f
And that someone was... the Old Ruler.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
Ages ago, the Old Ruler and that creature found the Hourglass. But the Ruler feared its power and asked her to guard over it until they decided what to do with it.

TAG: Jafar_027_f
She will not hand that Hourglass over to anyone but the Old Ruler.

TAG: Jafar_029_f
This might be a bit of a stretch but... maybe if we had some way to make her think I'm the Old Ruler... just long enough to get the Hourglass from her...

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Well, go back there and use your ingenuity to find a way to get it from her!
