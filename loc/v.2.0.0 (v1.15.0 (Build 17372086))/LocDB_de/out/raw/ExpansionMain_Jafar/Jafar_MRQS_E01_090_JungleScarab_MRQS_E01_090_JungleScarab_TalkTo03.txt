Ah, {PlayerName}, I see that my plan progresses nicely. You have obtained the second piece of the Scarab.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Isn't it OUR plan?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, full steam ahead!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No thanks to you.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Ha-ha-ha! What a quaint misinterpretation.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Hmm, worth a shot.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Here, take these schematics and put them to use.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Great!

TAG: Jafar_020_f
I await word of your success.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Wow, rude.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Anyway, we've run into a problem.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
This piece of the Scarab looks super beat up. The Tangle has really done a number on it.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
I don't think it can fit together with the other piece as is.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Yes... that does pose difficulties...

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Perhaps some temporal magic will put it right.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Are you able to access a <Lore>Timebending Table</Lore>, <Lore>Dream Shards</Lore>, and a source of <Lore>Mist</Lore>?

TAG: Jafar_018_f
I imagine that by using the impressive powers you have cultivated, you can <Lore>return the Scarab piece to its prior state</Lore>.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Indeed.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
{PlayerName}... were I capable of searching for the Scarab pieces myself, do you not think I would have done so already?

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I guess that makes sense...
