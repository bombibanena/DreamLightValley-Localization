At last, we meet in the flesh.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
OMG, Jafar! Hey bestie!!!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No sudden moves...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You better have a good reward for me...

TAG: Jafar_001_f
... "Bestie"?

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Refer to me as the Grand Vizier. Or perhaps, soon... Sultan of all I survey.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
But I shall forgive your insolence for now. I have one more task for you.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
What is it?

TAG: Jafar_010_f
There is something <Lore>hidden deep beneath this Island</Lore>. A relic of untold power.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
It is called <Lore>the Spark of Imagination</Lore>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What is it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What can it do?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Let me guess... You want me to get the Spark for you.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
I have only read the legends. But it is said to be the first spark of inspiration that drove the creation of this world.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
You mean... it's the magic behind all of Dreamlight Valley?

TAG: Jafar_026_f
And Eternity Isle. Dreamlight Magic may very well spring from this one ancient relic.

TAG: Jafar_029_f
*sigh* Let me guess... You want me to get this Spark of Imagination for you.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Very astute, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Only someone wielding the Hourglass can reach it. I fear the path is lost to time.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
After the way you proved yourself in the Cave of Wonders, I have confidence you will manage to find your way without making an utter fool of yourself.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
What exactly do you want the Spark of Imagination for?

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Why must you ask so many questions?!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm not risking my neck again without an explanation.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You're totally going to do something evil with it, aren't you?

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Ugh. If you MUST know... with the Spark of Imagination, all of space and time would bend to my desire.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
At last, I could make the world the way it ought to be... and have my revenge on Aladdin.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
Of course, there will always be a place for you, my humble servant, at my side!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Okay, now I'm DEFINITELY not helping you.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Let me think about this...

TAG: Jafar_021_f
*sigh* Then I suppose I'll have to do everything myself.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Give me that Hourglass. It is rightfully mine.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
There is nothing to think about.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
If you will not agree to help me... then I shall do it myself.

TAG: Jafar_028_f
Why, you even managed to get through all of my puzzles <Lore>without asking for a single hint</Lore>! Most impressive...

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Well, if someone wise and noble were to have it in their possession...

TAG: Jafar_027_f
...the only limit on their powers would be what they could imagine.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Oh, please. After all the time we have worked together, do you not trust me?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Pity. I was hoping you could help me with one more task...

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Do not worry. Your reward awaits...

TAG: Jafar_006_f
...after you carry out one more task for me.
