Hey, Mr. McDuck! Having fun?

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Aye, it's a grand gatherin'!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
But I'm here on business too! Got to check up on how my investment's progressing.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
The furnishings cost me a pretty penny, and I want to know when I can recoup my costs!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
When do you think I'll start receiving my 50% cut?

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Uhh, about that...

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Gaston doesn't actually have an income stream. He just wanted this place so people could pay attention to him.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
What?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sorry, I only realized after I got back to him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Guess you should have asked for a business plan, eh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did you just get outsmarted... by Gaston?!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Och, {PlayerName}, that is no way to do business!

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
No income stream... *sigh* Well, at least the food is good!

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Well, pluck me feathers and call me a cushion.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Never thought I'd see the day!

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Nay, dinnae say it, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
I hope we can keep this little misstep between us?

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
Of course!

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
When do you think I'll start receiving my 25% cut?
