I have to say, {PlayerName}. I understand why folks were more interested in the scenery than in my shop.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
The landscape here almost takes your breath away with all those ruins...

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Oh, but we're not talkin' about sightseeing; we're talkin' about the state of my former shop!

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
The exterior needs a fresh coat of paint, and the interior needs far more than that... I cannae open a shop in this state.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
A building makeover. I want to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let me guess: You need gems?

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
And that's a good thing, too. {PlayerName}, I'll need ya to gather some <ActivityItem>Quartz</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Pearls</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I'll get all of that.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
I'm sure I can find <Lore>Quartz and Copper in some of the Mining Rocks around Ancient's Landing</Lore>...

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
And I think I saw some <Lore>Pearls shining in the dirt</Lore>... I'll bet I can <Lore>find lots of Pearls if I just dig around</Lore>!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Hmmm... Some <ActivityItem>Quartz</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Pearls</ActivityItem> ought to do it.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Aye, {PlayerName}, I need gems and metal.

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Some <ActivityItem>Quartz</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Copper</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Pearls</ActivityItem>.
