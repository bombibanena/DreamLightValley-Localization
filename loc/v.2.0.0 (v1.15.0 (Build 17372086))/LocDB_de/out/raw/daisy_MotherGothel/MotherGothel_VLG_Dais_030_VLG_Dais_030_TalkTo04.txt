{PlayerName}. Let me guess: You've come to scold me about the note I sent Daisy.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Well? Go ahead. Somehow, I'm always the bad guy for simply telling the truth.

TAG: Player_000_f
Not at all. Daisy wanted you to know that we've made some changes to the Glade of Trust to make it more relaxing for you...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Isn't she the nicest?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How do you feel about that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think it's called "killing with kindness"?

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Hmpf... She's just doing that to look good.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
I'm sure these "relaxing" additions are absolute eyesores. I'll be back to tell you what I think.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
So?

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, are you still here?

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Well, I guess it's... not too horrendous.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
I still don't think she should be doling out advice, but... I can imagine reading a copy of the Dreamlight Gazette on my new furniture...

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
And then using it as kindling for my fireplace.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Underwhelmed.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Ha! I'm glad you see through her faÃ§ade.
