Oh, {PlayerName}... It's good to see you.

TAG: Anna_001_f
Ugh... sorry... I'm not feeling very well.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh no. What's wrong?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's happening to you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You better not be contagious.

TAG: Anna_002_f
Well, Ursula offered to create an INFINITE chocolate fountain, which of course I thought was an amazing idea!

TAG: Anna_011_f
I promise. Unless there's chocolate ice cream. I mean, ice cream couldn't hurt, right?

TAG: Anna_003_f
But... I was so excited I think I ate too much.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Who knew that too much chocolate could be a thing?

TAG: Anna_005_f
Hmm... Anna, usually Ursula doesn't give out anything for free. She expects something else in exchange.

TAG: Anna_006_f
Oh, I know. She asked for some <ActivityItem>Ice Shards</ActivityItem> made by Elsa's magic. I mean, it's just ice right? What could be the harm?

TAG: Anna_007_f
And Elsa left some ice blocks around the Village, so I was going to ask Kristoff to help me break them into shards. But he's kind of busy, and my stomach is all... BLECH! Any chance you could break them and bring them to Ursula for me?

TAG: Anna_008_f
Oh, and she also asked me to bring her some <ActivityItem>Snow</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Anna_009_f
I'm on it, Anna.

TAG: Anna_010_f
You just rest... and promise not to eat any more chocolate for a while.

TAG: Anna_012_f
Well, Ursula offered to create an INFINITE chocolate fountain, which of course I thought was an amazing idea!

TAG: Anna_013_f
Don't worry. I'm not. It's just that Ursula offered to create an INFINITE chocolate fountain, which of course I thought was an amazing idea!
