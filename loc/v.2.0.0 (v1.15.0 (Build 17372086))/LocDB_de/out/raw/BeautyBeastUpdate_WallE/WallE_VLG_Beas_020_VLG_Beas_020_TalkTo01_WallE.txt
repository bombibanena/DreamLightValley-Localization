WALLÂ·E! How's it going?

TAG: WallE_001_f
*beep beep*

TAG: WallE_002_f
How's the gardening going?

TAG: WallE_003_f
Oh, uh... Whoopee!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That good?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That bad?

TAG: WallE_004_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_013_f
Oh... oh! Whew!

TAG: WallE_014_f
So you're good to meet with him?

TAG: WallE_015_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_016_f
Perfect! I'll go talk to the Beast â if he's interested, I'll come by with him.

TAG: WallE_005_f
I was wondering if you wanted to maybe make a gardening buddy.

TAG: WallE_006_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_007_f
Great! It's the Beast â have you met him? I'm trying to introduce him to more of the Villagers.

TAG: WallE_008_f
Uh... Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

TAG: WallE_009_f
WALLÂ·E... are you scared of the Beast?

TAG: WallE_010_f
*shudders*

TAG: WallE_011_f
Aww, don't be! I know he's big and maybe a little scary-looking if you're not used to him.

TAG: WallE_012_f
But he's got a big heart, and he just wants to make some friends.

TAG: WallE_017_f
Huh?

TAG: WallE_018_f
I'm just kidding, WALLÂ·E!
