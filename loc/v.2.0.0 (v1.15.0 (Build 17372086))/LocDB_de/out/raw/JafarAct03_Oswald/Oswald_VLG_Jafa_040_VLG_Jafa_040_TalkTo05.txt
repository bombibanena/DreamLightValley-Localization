OK Oswald, it's your turn. How do you feel about what Jafar did?

TAG: Oswald_011_f
Jafar keeps yammerin' on that he's got goodness in him, so why not find proof of that?

TAG: Oswald_012_f
If we can catch some of them lost Memories and prove that he can rate, then I'm happy to let him stay.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
I'll even bring him a poutine myself!

TAG: Oswald_014_f
Interesting, thank you for your testimony, Oswald.

TAG: Oswald_015_f
Court will adjourn for the time being. I need to go <Lore>look for some of those lost Memories</Lore>.

TAG: Oswald_001_f
When we reconvene, I will either examine evidence of Jafar's past good actions...

TAG: Oswald_016_f
Or we will decide on his... eternal reward. Heh.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Well, if anybody's got a right to accuse him of something, it's me. He almost stole my luck!

TAG: Oswald_004_f
That's true. What do you want to happen to Jafar?

TAG: Oswald_005_f
Gee, I'm not sure...

TAG: Oswald_006_f
He's a tough customer, but shouldn't folks get a second chance in a place like this?

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Jafar's right â he did used to live here with us.

TAG: Oswald_008_f
But nobody remembers! For all I know, maybe I used to be a villain, and he stopped me from a whole bunch o' trolley-based mayhem!

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Do you think we should all just forget and forgive here?

TAG: Oswald_010_f
No way, judge-o!
