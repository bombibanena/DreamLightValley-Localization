Hey Oswald, got any judge candidates for me?

TAG: Oswald_001_f
You bet I do!

TAG: Oswald_002_f
I've been chin waggin' all over Eternity Isle, but nobody thought they were a bullseye.

TAG: Oswald_003_f
Oh no! Will we need to postpone the trial? We can't really do this without a judge.

TAG: Oswald_004_f
Hold your horses! Everybody did agree on one thingâ

TAG: Oswald_005_f
YOU oughta be the judge!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Me? The judge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No way; I can't do that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hmm, that does make sense...

TAG: Oswald_006_f
Yeah! You'd be tops!

TAG: Oswald_009_f
Think about it: You're the one that dynamited Jafar's plans, but you still wanna make sure he gets a fair trial.

TAG: Oswald_010_f
True...

TAG: Oswald_011_f
And we all trust that you can put your gripes aside and do right by both Jafar and the Valley.

TAG: Oswald_012_f
Well, when you put it like that, I guess I should.

TAG: Oswald_013_f
That's the ticket!

TAG: Oswald_014_f
Now, if you really wanna look the part, get ahold of a <ActivityItem>Powdered Wig</ActivityItem> and some spiffy duds.

TAG: Oswald_007_f
Sure ya can! Look at all you've done here when ya put your mind to it.

TAG: Oswald_008_f
I knew you'd see sense!
