{PlayerName}! I... I'm not sure what I'm doin' here.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
It was Ursula! You almost fell under the effects of her potion!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
What?! That villain! She'll be hearin' from me. You can count on that!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
As for you... Thank you, {PlayerName}, for the kind rescue.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Thank Sally!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll always be here to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It was a group effort, to be honest.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Aye, I'll be sure to!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
So, next time Sally has a vision, are you going to give her the benefit of the doubt?

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Most certainly!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Now tell me: Has Sally ever had visions about the stock market?

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
That... you may need to discuss with her later.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
And we are all grateful for that!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Well, I'm grateful to ya both.
