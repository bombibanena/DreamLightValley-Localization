Why {PlayerName}, what can I do for you today?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
I'm here on a serious mission, I'm afraid. You need to be careful about Ursula!

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Ursula, eh? What's she up to now? Tryin' to steal furniture from my shop?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No... or rather... I don't think so...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
If I say yes will you take me seriously?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Worse than that!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Well, is she stealin' from somewhere else?

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Again, I'm not sure, but...

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Och! Spit it out, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Sally had a vision! We're still figuring out the specifics, but you're in danger!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Vision? Not sure I set much stock in that fortune-telling stuff. Though, I have seen some mighty incredible things on my adventures.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're all true!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I know it's hard to believe...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Nobody ever believes her...

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
But you cannae know for certain.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Now, I'm not sayin' that Ursula has never done anything shady.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
But give your Uncle Scrooge some credit. I know how to handle myself!

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've some business to attend to...

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Maybe. Maybe not.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Well, that's a shame. But in this case, we just cannae be sure.

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
That depends. Have ya got any proof?
