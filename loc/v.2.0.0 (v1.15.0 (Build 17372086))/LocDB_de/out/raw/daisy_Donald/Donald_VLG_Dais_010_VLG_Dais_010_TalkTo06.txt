Aw phooey. Just look at this mess, {PlayerName}. And it's all my fault. I bet you came here to laugh at me, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm only here to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Laugh? What's the story here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This IS hilariously chaotic...

TAG: Donald_001_f
You are? That's fantastic! You see...

...Daisy and I were building her new wardrobe, when I hit my hand with the hammer â hard!

TAG: Donald_004_f
I jumped back and tripped on Daisy's toolbox, knocked over the flower pots, and spilled everything everywhere. It's a mess. A GIGANTIC mess!

TAG: Donald_005_f
Daisy's gotta be upset! I bet she's furious with me.

TAG: Donald_006_f
Donald... it was an accident, and Daisy's worried that YOU'RE upset with her. Why don't we start fixing this by cleaning up?

TAG: Donald_008_f
You'll help me? Oh boy, oh boy! Thanks!

TAG: Donald_007_f
It was an accident. Let me talk to her, okay?

TAG: Donald_003_f
Chaotic? More like catastrophic!
