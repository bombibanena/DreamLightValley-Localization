Say, {PlayerName}, I've been tryin' to fish around Eternity Isle, but my luck's been all luck-less!

TAG: Goofy_018_f
Don't worry! I'll help!

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Really?! Gawrsh, that'd be great!

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Here, I'll tell ya what happened... First I saw this <Lore>funny fish that looked like a robot swimmin' around Ancient's Landing</Lore>...

TAG: Goofy_003_f
I hooked it, but it nearly pulled me right into the water!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Uh... why don't you leave catching that one to me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Just find some water skis and we'll have a new Village activity!

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Sure thing! I'll watch you and see how it's done.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Then, next I tried fishing for one of them <ActivityItem>Duneboppers</ActivityItem> in the quicksand in the Glittering Dunes...

TAG: Goofy_008_f
But I lost nine fishing rods. And I don't think I'll be gettin' those ones back.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
No worries. I'll handle catching that.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
We could build a quicksand-proof diving suit...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Wanna try one more time to make it a nice even ten?

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Aw, thanks! You're a real pal. I can't wait to see what the trick to it is.

TAG: Goofy_014_f
Now, the last one's real special. I was walking around the Wild Tangle and I spotted somethin' glowin' in the water.

TAG: Goofy_015_f
It was some kinda shrimp, but its shell was shinin' with all the colors of the rainbow!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Prisma Shrimp! I'll catch one for you.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Now I've GOT to see this...

TAG: Goofy_016_f
Oh boy! Let's go fishin'!

TAG: Goofy_010_f
Quicksand snorkeling... now that could be fun!

TAG: Goofy_012_f
But it does sound kinda dangerous.

TAG: Goofy_013_f
Okay, fair enough. Maybe I'll just handle catching that <ActivityItem>Dunebopper</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Goofy_011_f
Gawrsh, no. Half the profits from my Stall are goin' to new fishing rods!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Say, do you think that'd work...?

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Maybe... but I guess we should try catching one before we try to invent a new water sport. I'll handle that.
