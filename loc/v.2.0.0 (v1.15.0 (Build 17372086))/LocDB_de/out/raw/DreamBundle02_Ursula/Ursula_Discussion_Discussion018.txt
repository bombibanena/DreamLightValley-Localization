Actually, I am.

Now that I don't have to wait for someone to step close to the water...

TAG: Ursula_002_f
I'm finding myself in all sorts of conversations!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You talk with Ariel about anything?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Have you ever chatted with Buzz?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is Goofy a good conversationalist?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
No.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
What could we possibly have to say to each other?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Fair enough.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
You mean that annoying little child's plaything?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
He claims to refuse to "converse with evil." And I refuse to listen to his wild accusations.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Yeah, he takes the Space Ranger thing pretty seriously.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Far more than I expected.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
He's quite interested in all things aquatic.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Really?

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Yes, apparently he's studied swimming, diving, something called "surf bathing," and even dining underwater.
