Terrestrial flute music? What a horror! One disadvantage of walking on land is having to hear that excruciating din!

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Now aquatic flutes... they're entirely different!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's wrong with regular flutes?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Never heard of aquatic flutes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are there aquatic brass instruments?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
I really don't have all day, dearie.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Tell me one thing.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Fine. They're hideously tinny and shrill!

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Or maybe that's just how Ariel's little princie plays them.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I guess I never considered how music might be different underwater!

TAG: Ursula_007_f
If you ever grow gills, you really should ask Ariel for a tour.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Oh, they're a thing of beauty, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Formed from pyrosome colonies, a dozen feet long.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Playing them is a skill that takes decades to master.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
We have our own versions. Think less brass and more shell.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Oh, I didn't think of that.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Occasionally, a human instrument washes overboard from a ship.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
But they sound even more hideous underwater.
