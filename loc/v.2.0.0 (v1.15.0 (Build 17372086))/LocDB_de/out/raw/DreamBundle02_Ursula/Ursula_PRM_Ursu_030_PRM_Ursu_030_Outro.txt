What a waste! It would have been a brilliant performance. All I wanted was to show the Village a glimpse of the shows performed in the sea.

I'm sorry, Ursula.

You could always organize a real one.

That's what you get for stealing voices.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
You know, I think you are.

TAG: Ursula_000_f
You could always make a space in the Valley for putting on grand performances.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Here. Why don't you keep the stage? Set it up wherever you like.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Maybe someday you can put on a show worthy of the ones I used to stage when I lived in the palace!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Without backup vocals from the squid? Why bother. Of course...

Don't get so high and mighty... There are already enough judgmental do-gooders running around this Valley. Of course...
