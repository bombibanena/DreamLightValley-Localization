Ah, {PlayerName}, there you are. I've thought of a way to continue what we started together. I'm going to make the surface of the Valley far more entertaining.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
And I need an assistant. Tell me you'll help me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, always.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hmm, maybe later.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Fabulous!

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Now, angelfish, I don't know if you've heard, but we seafolk are superb entertainers.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
I'd like to show the Villagers what they're missing and put on a performance for the Valley.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Something that'll put Triton's boring little spectacles to shame.

TAG: Player_001_f
You could get some Villagers to help you. That would be a good opportunity for...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...you to make some friends.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...the whole Village to come together.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...you to show them how it's done.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Hmph. We'll see. Though...

TAG: Ursula_017_f
I suppose I could use some backup singers to complement my stunning voice. Who do you think would work?

TAG: Player_003_f
We need someone...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
...to be your partner in crime for duets.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
...with a sweet voice for high harmonies.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
...for the lower harmonies.

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Maybe Mother Gothel?

TAG: Ursula_000_f
Gothel! Ha-ha-ha! I'd love for her to be part of the show.

TAG: Ursula_024_f
Great, sounds like that's everyone we'll need! I'll ask them to join.

TAG: Ursula_025_f
Join? Hardly. No one graces Ursula's stage without an audition.

TAG: Ursula_028_f
And since you're going to be helping me... you should look the part. Here. Put these on.

TAG: Ursula_029_f
I had them made just for you!

TAG: Ursula_021_f
Maybe Mirabel? Her singing voice would contrast yours nicely!

TAG: Ursula_023_f
You're right. It would.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Maybe Kristoff? He doesn't like to brag, but he's a pretty great singer, and he plays a mean lute!

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Kristoff... I doubt he'll try to upstage me. He'll do.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Ugh, must you always be so sentimental?

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Last time, you were complaining about being exiled. Wouldn't you like to be part of something now that you can be?

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Fine... you may have a point.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Hmm... you do have a point...

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Fine... but don't take too long. You wouldn't want me to wither away from boredom, would you?
