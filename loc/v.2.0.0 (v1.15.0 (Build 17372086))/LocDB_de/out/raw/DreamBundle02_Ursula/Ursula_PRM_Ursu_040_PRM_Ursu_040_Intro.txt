Angelfish, just who I was hoping to see!

Tell me, would you have time to help me with some deals I've made?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not right now.

Marvelous!

I'm going to help you get what you're promised...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...so nobody ends up in your garden.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...because I'd love to become just like you.

TAG: Ursula_008_f

And he hasn't delivered. I'm practically wasting away from lack of nourishment! Be a dear and get him to pay up.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Well then, consider this a learning opportunity.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Don't wait too long, or I'll have to add some Villagers to my garden.
