Brilliantly!

TAG: Ursula_001_f
And now that I can walk about on dry land, I'm considering creating a new one here as well.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Planning on growing anything in particular?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This one won't have unfortunate souls, will it?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Of course it is, angelfish! It's mine, isn't it?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Ahh, I can see it already...

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Basil, ginger, lemon, mint... I've learned they all have interesting uses in potion-making.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
I hear you're an excellent terrestrial gardener â any tips for someone used to growing things underwater?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Be careful about overwatering!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Talk to your plants to help them grow.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Dreamlight helps things grow here â go wild!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
OVER-watering? That's possible?

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Afraid so.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Fascinating.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
{PlayerName}... don't tell me you have plants that used to be sentient creatures as well?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
No!

TAG: Ursula_011_f
What a shame... I thought we had something new in common.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Dreamlight... I'll remember that.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Most definitely! There are whole hosts of potions that require terrestrial plants.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Now I won't have to trade with Gothel for them.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
... No promises.

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Ursula! That's not being very neighborly!

TAG: Ursula_017_f
Fine. Let's just say that unfortunate souls won't be the first things I'll plant.
