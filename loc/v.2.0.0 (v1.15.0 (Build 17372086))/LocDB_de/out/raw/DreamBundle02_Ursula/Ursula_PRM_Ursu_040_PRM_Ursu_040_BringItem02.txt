{PlayerName}, I knew I could count on you!

It's only half. Goofy is getting the other half. I fixed his fishing rod for him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Please don't add him to your garden.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is this enough for now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You'll have to make sure he pays the rest.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Don't worry, angelfish. I won't. Normally I don't accept payment plans, but for you, I'll make an exception.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
I'm sure now that Goofy's fishing rod is fixed, he'll get me the rest.

TAG: Ursula_000_f
Oh, and here, this is for your trouble. It's a little potion I brewed up so that the next time you need to catch something, you'll have no trouble at all.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
For now. But only because...

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Oh, I will. Besides...
