Angelfish! Just the creature I need to see. Tell me you have time to help me rectify a tragedy of injustice!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes, of course.

This will have to wait.

Donald and I made a little deal. And being the generous and reliable woman I am, you know I delivered my part on the dot.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
But now, he's refusing to pay.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
And he refuses to give back what I gave him.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Be a dear and go retrieve it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
That doesn't sound like Donald. I'll talk to him.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'll get what you need right now.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Talk to the little pest or don't. As long as you get back what belongs to me.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
And that's why you're my favorite little helper.

What you're looking for appears to be a blue gift box. You'll have to search his home. For all I know, he's stuffed it under the bed or something careless like that.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Fine... But hurry. I don't think you want me finding my own solution to this problem.
