*sigh* I assume Donald told you everything.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The important part is that you've come clean.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't know what to say.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eh, I would have done the same.

TAG: Ursula_001_f
And that he insists it was some sort of scheme...

TAG: Ursula_002_f
But trust me, dearie. It was merely a test! A test to see if you were paying attention toâ

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Oh... why bother...

TAG: Ursula_004_f
What do you mean?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
I just can't do it to you, {PlayerName}. This WAS a scheme.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
What???

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Donald asked for a gift to give to you, and I saw the opportunity to use a spell that captures Dreamlight Magic...

TAG: Ursula_008_f
But I can't trick you. You've been too loyal to me all this time.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
You're always so forgiving. It's infuriating.

And contagious. What am I becoming? A formerly ruthless dealmaker with a soft spot for do-gooders?

TAG: Ursula_011_f
Here, this is for you. A token of appreciation... and apology.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
I'm sure you're shocked that I revealed my scheme unprompted...

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Oh, what am I becoming? A formerly ruthless dealmaker with a soft spot for do-gooders?

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Ha! You would, wouldn't you?
