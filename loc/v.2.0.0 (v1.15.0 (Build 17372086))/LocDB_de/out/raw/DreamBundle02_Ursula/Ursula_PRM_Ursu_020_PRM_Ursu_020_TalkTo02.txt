Tell me everything, angelfish. They refused, didn't they?

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Oh well, too bad...

TAG: Player_000_f
No, no, they all accepted. Kristoff and Mirabel's auditions were great, but Mother Gothel didn't even sing...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
But I'm sure she'll be great.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you want to do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She thinks she's the star of the show...

TAG: Ursula_005_f
I'll be the judge of that. Don't worry, dearie.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
As for Mother Gothel, I know she has plenty of <ActivityItem>Potion Bottles</ActivityItem> in the Giant Willow. I'm sure she won't mind parting with one.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
You've done a fine job. Now, there's just a couple of things I need you to do for me while I go talk to my new backup singers.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
I've been chatting with Scrooge, and he tells me he has some sort of device that amplifies the voice of those who speak into it.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
A <ActivityItem>Microphone</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
Yes, that's it! I want to enchant it for my backup singers. Just a little something to help them with stage fright.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
We'll need an item from each of them for the enchantment.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
What do you need me to get?

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Something they use often but won't miss. Something they can replace easily.

TAG: Ursula_014_f
Let's see... Mirabel always has a lot of those ridiculous <ActivityItem>Pinwheels</ActivityItem>. And I think Kristoff got a new <ActivityItem>Pickaxe</ActivityItem> recently, but the old one's still lying around...

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Oh, she'll soon realize who's boss around here. Don't worry, dearie.
