HA! Their faces when the enchantment worked... It was priceless!

Why would you do that?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
I need backup VOICES. Just the voices. No need for singers to be there and possibly steal the show.

You have to fix this, Ursula!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How could you?! We were all rooting for you!!

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Ugh... if it really bothers you so much, then fine.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Since you insist, I'll give them back their voices.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
But it's going to take some time. That first enchantment was exhausting!

I thought you were going to help the Valley. Not curse people!
