Quick learner!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hope you didn't hurt yourself.

What about dancing?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Indeed! Just another reason I would have made an excellent ruler of Atlantica.

What about you â can you swim?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm no fish, but I'm great for a human!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I dabble.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
About as well as a stone.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
How nice for you.

TAG: Ursula_005_f

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Hardly a bump or bruise.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Oh, I'm a marvelous dancer, no matter where! Ask anyone.
