{PlayerName}... I'm feeling more and more myself.

TAG: Lorekeeper_000_f
I daresay my pages are crisp, and my spine is not so creased!

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
Have you done it? Have you ended the feud between Maleficent and Hades?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Not quite.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm so close!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Those two are IMPOSSIBLE!

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
Both of them want to hear an apology, but neither of them wants to apologize.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
I'm not surprised. Nothing can be simple with those two.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
I did discover something interesting though...

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
Both of them stole Story Magic from your pages. Maybe that's what set this whole thing off?

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
Why... why yes! Now I remember â Maleficent flipped through my pages and drained me of an old story about her...

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
...and Hades did the same, ripping from me an old tale about him.

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
The Snippets in Maleficent's castle and the palace on Mount Olympus were causing all sorts of trouble. I captured them using my Royal Net!

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
Why didn't you say so? <Lore>Restore them to my pages</Lore> at once!
