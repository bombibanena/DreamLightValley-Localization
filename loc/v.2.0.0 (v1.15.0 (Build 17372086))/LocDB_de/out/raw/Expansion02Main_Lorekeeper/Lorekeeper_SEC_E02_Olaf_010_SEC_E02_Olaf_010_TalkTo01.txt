You and Olaf seem to be hitting it off.

TAG: Lorekeeper_001_f
He is quite... enthusiastic.

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
I would never wish to dampen the tiny snowman's love of scintillating trivia or a good story. But...

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
...given my condition, I need far more rest now. *cough cough*

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll ask Olaf to leave you alone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
There must be another source of fun facts around here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe we could trick him into talking to some other book.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
Please be careful not to hurt the little snowman's feelings.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
Perhaps if there was something else to occupy him, to keep him busy?

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
There's one person who knows Olaf better than anybody.

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
Anna! I'll <Lore>talk to her</Lore> and see if we can find a new hobby for Olaf.

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
Yes, that's a fine idea â something else to occupy the little snowman.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
The little snowman is far too clever for that. But something else to occupy his time is not a bad idea.
