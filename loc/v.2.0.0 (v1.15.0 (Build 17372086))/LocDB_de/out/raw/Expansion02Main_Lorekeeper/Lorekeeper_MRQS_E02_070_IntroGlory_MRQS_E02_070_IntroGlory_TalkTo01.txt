Ahh, {PlayerName}! Where has your story taken you? What have you uncovered?

TAG: Player_000_f
I journeyed into a golden field in Mythopia. That place is...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...so cool and epic!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...a really nice vacation spot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...a total mess. So much ink!

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
Why, of course it is. It's made up of stories of great heroism and grand adventure!

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
I stumbled upon something else there.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
It was another of those gateways, like the one that I found in Everafter!

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
Ahhh... I know exactly what you've discovered.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
Beyond that gateway, you will find a <Lore>Mythic Trial</Lore> waiting to test you.

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
When Hades took control of Mythopia... adding his own false version of Mount Olympus to one corner...

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
...the magic went wrong. It all became corrupted and jumbled up, like an old story that's changed in the telling.

TAG: Lorekeeper_014_f
And pieces of Mount Olympus have been scattered across Mythopia, spreading magical corruption throughout the land!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What will I find inside?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What should I do next?

TAG: Lorekeeper_015_f
I suspect you'll find old myths and tales of heroism gone awry.

TAG: Lorekeeper_016_f
Corrupted by the lord of the Underworld's rancor.

TAG: Lorekeeper_017_f
You must set them right and reach the very heart of them to undo what Hades has done.

TAG: Lorekeeper_018_f
So what should I do next?

TAG: Lorekeeper_019_f
<Lore>Seek the aid of Merida</Lore>. She can help you get inside the Trial.

TAG: Lorekeeper_020_f
Remember: With each Trial you face, you draw one step closer to reaching Hades and rescuing the Vale!

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
It looked like some sort of... some sort of gateway, filled with ink.

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
Yes, it has a most extraordinary beauty to it, does it not? And no wonder. It's sewn together from stories of great heroism and grand adventure.

TAG: Lorekeeper_013_f
Oh dear. Before all that ink spilled from the ground, it was a beautiful place, sewn together from stories of great heroism and grand adventure.
