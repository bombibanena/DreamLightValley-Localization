{PlayerName}! I sense that you've turned a new page in your journey to stop the Neverafter.

TAG: Lorekeeper_001_f
What have you discovered?

TAG: Player_000_f
I found some mysterious waterfalls shaped like a teapot in Everafter.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're so cool!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're awfully curious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That place is SUPER STRANGE.

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
Ah, yes! The Teapot Falls were a most beautiful sight before all the ink sprang up, muddying the place.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
I'd like to get closer and investigate them, but something is blocking the way. Giant teacups shattered everywhere!

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
Those are a remnant of Maleficent and Hades' feud. They quarreled in the sky over Everafter and rubble was strewn about.

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
Aurora faced this same problem once, long ago.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
It seems your story is becoming even more intertwined with hers!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Where could Aurora be?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How did Aurora solve this problem?

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
I'm afraid I haven't the faintest idea. The ending of her story is still unwritten.

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
But perhaps you could follow in her footsteps to solve your challenge.

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
With a little help from the good fairies, Aurora discovered the secret to clearing away the rubble.

TAG: Lorekeeper_013_f
Perhaps her notes are hidden somewhere. This part of Aurora's story is lost to me, I'm afraid...

TAG: Lorekeeper_014_f
I knew it once. But it's become scattered, like so many of my precious stories.

TAG: Lorekeeper_015_f
So if I <Lore>caught some Snippets in Everafter</Lore>... maybe I could <Lore>bring that story back to your pages</Lore>?

TAG: Lorekeeper_016_f
Yes... seek out the Snippets, and restore Aurora's tale! It's the only way to learn how she faced this problem.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
Ah, yes. Such a mysterious sight, like something right out of a bedtime story.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
The unknown is not to be feared, {PlayerName}. Every great story starts with a step into the unknown, doesn't it?
