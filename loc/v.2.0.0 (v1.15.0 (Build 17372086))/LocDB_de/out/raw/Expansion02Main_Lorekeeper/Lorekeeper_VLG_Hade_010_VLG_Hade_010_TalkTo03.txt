Hi, Lorekeeper! I heard from some other Villagers that you might know something about lightning?

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
Yes indeed, {PlayerName}. It is a tale from long ago...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Do tell!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I don't have time for stories right now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can we stick with the lightning instructions for now?

Once upon a time there lived a poor scientist.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
He longed to pierce the veil of ignorance and bring knowledge to the world!

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
He was captivated by electricity and worked day and night to uncover how to harness it for the good of all.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
Alas, his work was destroyed! A rival lied and besmirched his name.

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
A true tragedy, but his work lives on here.

For now, the <ActivityItem>Lightning Generator</ActivityItem> can be found in <Lore>the East wing of the Library of Lore, near a globe model</Lore>.

TAG: Lorekeeper_009_f
The machine is not powered now, but you can activate it by filling it with <Lore>Lightning Spice</Lore>.

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
But beware... Add more than five and the lightning may become unstable!

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
Thanks, Lorekeeper!

I understand â all stories must be told in their proper season. As to your immediate needs, there is something nearby that should help.
