I understand you've run afoul of Hades.

TAG: Lorekeeper_002_f
Be careful around him, {PlayerName}. He's slippery.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He's actually kind of funny.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He seems okay.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's a JERK is what he is.

TAG: Lorekeeper_010_f
Well, he uses a sharp tongue to hide his true malevolence. Don't fall for it.

...and find the Sacred Spring.

TAG: Lorekeeper_015_f
Is there something you wished to ask me about?

TAG: Lorekeeper_013_f
I've come across some mysterious flames. Hades told me I need to find "a Sacred Spring" to get rid of them.

TAG: Lorekeeper_003_f
Hmm... a <Lore>Sacred Spring</Lore>! Yes, I remember it.

TAG: Lorekeeper_004_f
Its waters could help extinguish any flame... even the magical flames scattered about by Maleficent and Hades.

TAG: Lorekeeper_005_f
But I'm afraid I've no idea where that spring might be.

TAG: Lorekeeper_006_f
I remember that Aurora found it once, with the help of the good fairies.

TAG: Lorekeeper_007_f
But this is another story that's become lost and scattered from my pages.

TAG: Lorekeeper_008_f
If you could <Lore>capture some of the Snippets</Lore> in Mythopia, perhaps you could restore this lost tale...

TAG: Lorekeeper_011_f
He plays at being harmless when it suits him. Don't let it fool you.

TAG: Lorekeeper_012_f
I'm glad to see he hasn't pulled the wool over your eyes with his occasional charms. But he's more than just a cad.

TAG: Lorekeeper_014_f
Take heed. Hades can be quite dangerous.
