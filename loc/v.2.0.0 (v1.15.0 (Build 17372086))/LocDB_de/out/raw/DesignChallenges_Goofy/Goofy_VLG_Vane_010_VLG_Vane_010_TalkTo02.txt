Hi, Goofy! Vanellope and I are putting together a race kart! Do you have anything that can glue pastry together?

Gawrsh, a racing kart made outta pastry? That's somethin' I gotta see!

But I don't know much about bakin' or glue. Not sure I can help...

You should talk to someone who likes to bake!
