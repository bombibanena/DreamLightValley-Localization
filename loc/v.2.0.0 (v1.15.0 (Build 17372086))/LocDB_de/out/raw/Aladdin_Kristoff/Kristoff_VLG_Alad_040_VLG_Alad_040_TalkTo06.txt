Hey, {PlayerName}. Aladdin told me you're putting together a marketplace. That's a pretty great idea.

I used to sell a LOT of ice at the market in Arendelle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Any advice about running a stall?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can we add your stall to the marketplace?

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Well, when I first met Anna, Elsa had accidentally made a permanent winter in Arendelle.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
With snow and ice everywhere, that would pretty severely cut into my ice business.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
People wouldn't NEED what I was selling. So, that's my advice: Sell something people really want, or need!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Solid advice!

We're opening a gem stall; we'll be good.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Hey, anytime!

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
A gem stall? That will definitely do well.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Yeah, I'd love to have a place in your market... As long as there's room.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
But hey, this is your Valley. I'll be happy with whatever you decide.
