Okay Kristoff, I'm on the case of the spider infestation!

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
That's great news! Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
They're kind of everywhere, and it's starting to make things pretty difficult.

I was gonna make some chocolate cookies, but then I got worried that I'd set the webs on fire.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Well, soon enough you should be fine to cook away to your heart's content!

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
I really appreciate it. And you know, I've heard some other Villagers have also been having trouble with spiders.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Others too?! Wow, I should probably <Lore>fetch those for Jack as well</Lore>. Which Houses have been invaded?

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
I think it's <Lore>Remy's, Vanellope's, and Mirabel's Houses</Lore>.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Guess I have my next stops after I've spoken to Jack then!
