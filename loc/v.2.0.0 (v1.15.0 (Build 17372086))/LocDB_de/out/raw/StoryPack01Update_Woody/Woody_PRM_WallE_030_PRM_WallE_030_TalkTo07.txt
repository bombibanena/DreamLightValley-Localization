Howdy, partner! What brings you 'round these parts?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Cattle rustlers have been sighted!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Someone poisoned the water hole!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
WALLÂ·E is planning a get-together, and you're invited!

TAG: Woody_001_f
Oh no! What do we do?! Gather a posse?! Call the sheriff?! Wait â I'm the sheriff! Guess I'm more used to dealing with pets, cranky toddlers, and vacuum cleaners.

TAG: Woody_010_f
Say, do you think you could help?

TAG: Woody_011_f
Sure. What do you need?

TAG: Woody_012_f
There's something strange going on in the Forest of Valor.

TAG: Woody_013_f
Night Thorns have grown up around a bunch of Mining Rocks. Think you could help me clear 'em out?

TAG: Woody_014_f
I'd take care of it myself, but it'd be pretty tricky for me to handle a pickaxe, what with bein' toy-sized and all.

TAG: Woody_015_f
No problem, Woody; I'll take a look!

TAG: Woody_016_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}! Buzz is worried that something nefarious might be hidden in those mining spots, so clearin' 'em out will really put his mind at ease.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Wait a second... We don't have cattle in the Valley!

TAG: Woody_003_f
You're too perceptive â I was just joking around!

TAG: Woody_004_f
Ha! Not bad. Ya got me.

TAG: Woody_005_f
So what's really up?

TAG: Woody_006_f
You're invited to a little shindig!

TAG: Woody_007_f
WALLÂ·E's throwing a dance, and I'm telling the invitees. Think you'd be up for cutting a rug? I know you've got some moves!

TAG: Woody_008_f
That does sound like fun. And I do like to dance.

TAG: Woody_009_f
But I just told Buzz I'd do something for him while he's on patrol.

TAG: Woody_017_f
What?! It was Scar, wasn't it?

TAG: Woody_018_f
Nah, I'm just kidding. You can relax.

TAG: Woody_019_f
Phew! Ya really had me there for a second.
