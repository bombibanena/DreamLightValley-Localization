Does this mean you're clear to come cut a rug with the rest of us?

TAG: Woody_004_f
You betcha, partner!

TAG: Woody_005_f
Just gotta go get my party boots ready!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Polishing them up?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Making sure they contain no snakes?

TAG: Woody_006_f
Yeah. Heh-heh. That's what I meant seein' as how I've only got the one pair.

TAG: Woody_007_f
Understood.

TAG: Woody_008_f
Well, I've got to go check in with the progress.

TAG: Woody_009_f
See you in a bit, Woody!

TAG: Woody_010_f
