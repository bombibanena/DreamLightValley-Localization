Oh, it's you, angelfish. And I see you brought that squeaky little creature along...

TAG: Ursula_001_f
What can I do for you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm here to BATTLE YOU!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you know what a boss battle is?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This was Vanellope's idea.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Battle me? Oh, that's delicious! As though little old you could ever hope to best me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I know your weak spot!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Show me what you've got!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's just pretend!

TAG: Ursula_003_f
As soon as you raise your tentacles, you're done, villain!

TAG: Ursula_004_f
If I raise my tentacles, you and your sweet little sidekick will be new residents of my garden. So, my advice to you...

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Scram!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Now you're starting to annoy me. Enough of this foolishness!

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Get out of here before I add you and your little sidekick to my garden!

TAG: Ursula_008_f
You came here to... play a game with me? Don't you know how busy I am?!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Well... I know twelve spells using squid ink, the magical properties of sea urchin spines, but that? No.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
It's a part in a game when you have a big fight.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
And you came here to battle me? Because I'm the boss... Well, I'm almost flattered.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
So... want to battle?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
It seemed like a thing a villain might like...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
EN GARDE!

TAG: Ursula_012_f
Absolutely not. I'm actually fond of you angelfish, and if you crossed me, well...

TAG: Ursula_013_f
I'd feel so betrayed...

TAG: Ursula_014_f
I'd have to add you and your sweet little sidekick to my garden.

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Now... Scram!

TAG: Ursula_016_f
Oh, I see. You think I have nothing better to do than be YOUR villain?

TAG: Ursula_017_f
You should go before I turn you and your sticky little sidekick into new residents of my garden.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
Bad. Choice.

TAG: Ursula_019_f
This has been a waste of my valuable time, so I'll make you a deal...

TAG: Ursula_020_f
You leave, and I won't put you in my garden or feed your friend to my eels.

TAG: Ursula_021_f
She wanted me to battle you. We thought you might like it...?

TAG: Ursula_022_f
Only a child could think it was a good idea to waste my time like this.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
So... no boss battle?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
We thought you'd have fun.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Why are you like this?

TAG: Ursula_023_f
Afraid not, angelfish. As much as I love a good farce, I'm a busy woman.

TAG: Ursula_024_f
I suggest you leave before your sidekick breaks something she can't fix and joins my garden to pay off the debt.

TAG: Ursula_025_f
FUN? HA! That's precious...

TAG: Ursula_026_f
If you want to have fun, come back when you have real business for me.

TAG: Ursula_027_f
Like what, dear?

TAG: Ursula_028_f
Impatient with people showing up to battle me for their amusement? Interrupting my work? Disturbing my concentration?

TAG: Ursula_029_f
Whyever would such a thing bother me?

TAG: Ursula_030_f
Grr... You'd best be gone before I decide to feed your little sidekick to my eels.
