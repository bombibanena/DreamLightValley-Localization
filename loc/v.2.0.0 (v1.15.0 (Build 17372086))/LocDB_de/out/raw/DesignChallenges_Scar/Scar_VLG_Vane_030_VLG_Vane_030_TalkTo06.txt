TAG: Scar_036_f
Which is...?

TAG: Player_013_choice_000_f
Pixel Sword!

TAG: Player_013_choice_001_f
Friendship!

TAG: Scar_000_f
Ah, {PlayerName}... So it's you I have to thank for leaving that mess outside my den...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This is GREAT pre-boss battle banter.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Ehh... yeah, sorry about that.

TAG: Scar_037_f
That is a child's plaything. Did that sticky little cub give it to you?

TAG: Scar_038_f
Please don't let it touch me. It'll mat my fur.

TAG: Scar_039_f
Ha, see! Even you cower before the might of the Pixel Sword!

TAG: Scar_040_f
Vanellope and I will defeat you together!

TAG: Scar_041_f
How quaint. Now, please leave. Your earnestness is making me nauseous.

TAG: Scar_042_f
And what way is that exactly?

TAG: Player_014_choice_000_f
The way where you surrender!

TAG: Player_014_choice_001_f
The way my sidekick and I will defeat you!

TAG: Scar_043_f
Is there a reason you're speaking like this? It's even more inane than usual...

TAG: Scar_044_f
Sidekick?

TAG: Scar_045_f
The fish were a fitting tribute. I'll savor them later.

TAG: Scar_046_f
Now, why are you here?

TAG: Player_015_choice_000_f
For the final boss battle!

TAG: Player_015_choice_001_f
I'm humoring Vanellope.

TAG: Scar_047_f
She wants me to "battle" you as a game.

TAG: Scar_048_f
I mostly came along to make sure you don't decide she'll make a good snack.

TAG: Scar_049_f
No need to worry. She smells far too sweet for me to even consider it.

TAG: Scar_050_f
Still, you let this precocious little cub talk you into provoking me? For a game?

TAG: Player_016_choice_000_f
Everyone needs to have fun sometimes.

TAG: Player_016_choice_001_f
Why do you hate joy?

TAG: Scar_051_f
I find your definition of "fun" rather pathetic.

TAG: Scar_052_f
But you did say you came here for a fight? May I entice you with a battle of wits?

TAG: Scar_053_f
That's much more my idea of "fun."

TAG: Player_017_choice_000_f
I'll show you. Play the game!

TAG: Player_017_choice_001_f
Our fun helps you blow off steam.

TAG: Scar_054_f
Ugh, very well.

TAG: Scar_055_f
Then you have an odd way of releasing tension...

TAG: Scar_056_f
Running into danger seems far from relaxing.

TAG: Player_018_choice_000_f
Okay, so your fun is different.

TAG: Player_018_choice_001_f
We wanted to include you!

TAG: Scar_057_f
There are tons of ways to have fun!

TAG: Scar_058_f
Loud, tiresome, ridiculous ways, clearly.

TAG: Player_019_choice_000_f
Maybe you like quiet fun?

TAG: Player_019_choice_001_f
Nothing wrong with that!

TAG: Scar_059_f
I certainly enjoy lounging by the pond in the shade on hot days.

TAG: Scar_060_f
The warm breeze in my mane.

TAG: Scar_061_f
Catching fresh fish with my bare claws.

TAG: Player_020_choice_000_f
Those sound really fun!

TAG: Player_020_choice_001_f
You look happy, Scar.

TAG: Scar_062_f
Even though it's not loud and boisterous?

TAG: Scar_063_f
Well, we seem to have reached some sort of... dÃ©tente. But since I doubt you'll leave it at that...

TAG: Scar_064_f
I'll concede victory to you... just this once.

TAG: Scar_065_f
"Happy"? Don't be absurd. At most... content.

TAG: Scar_066_f
Unless you're having a bad time...

TAG: Scar_067_f
What was that?

TAG: Scar_068_f
We wanted to include you in our game?

TAG: Player_021_choice_000_f
Teeth, claws and all!

TAG: Player_021_choice_001_f
There's a fuzzy softie somewhere in there!

TAG: Scar_069_f
You want me in your game, knowing all you know about me?

TAG: Scar_070_f
Fascinating. I'm rarely included by choice.

TAG: Player_022_choice_000_f
Are you upset?

TAG: Player_022_choice_001_f
First time for everything!

TAG: Scar_071_f
No...

TAG: Scar_072_f
Surprisingly, I'm not.

TAG: Scar_073_f
Oh, enough of this! Would you please leave?

TAG: Scar_074_f
...

TAG: Scar_075_f
Indeed.

TAG: Scar_076_f
You couldn't be more wrong. And yet...

TAG: Scar_077_f
Oh, I don't.

TAG: Scar_001_f
Battle? My my, I must say I have been waiting for you to show your claws.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
This is the final battle!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm sorry it had to be this way, Scar...

TAG: Scar_002_f
Oh, I see. You brought the sticky little cub with you.

TAG: Scar_003_f
This is some sort of game?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Prepare for swift defeat!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Yeah, so play along!

TAG: Scar_004_f
And how exactly will you "defeat" me?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'll watch your attack patterns!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'll wield my Pixel Sword!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
My sidekick will help me!

TAG: Scar_005_f
My what? Ugh, this is getting tiresome...

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Tired? Your health is low!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Victory is almost mine!

TAG: Scar_006_f
Yes, yes. You've worn me down, I couldn't possibly lift a paw against you.

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
Sweet triumph!

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
Now drop some loot!

TAG: Scar_007_f
Bravo. You win this inane charade. Now kindly... get out.

TAG: Scar_008_f
I've no idea what you're talking about. Now please, leave. My patience is growing dangerously thin.

TAG: Scar_009_f
If I admit "defeat" in this ridiculous tableau, will you leave?

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
I accept your surrender!

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
Well fought, Final Boss.

TAG: Scar_010_f
Surrender? I... Oh, fine. Yes. I surrender. Now leave.

TAG: Scar_011_f
Don't feel too bad. Vanellope and I make an unstoppable team.

TAG: Scar_012_f
An insufferable team, more like. I suggest you leave before I lose my temper.

TAG: Scar_013_f
That? It looks as though a child made it... *sigh* This is becoming exhausting.

TAG: Scar_014_f
The sticky one? Ugh, she's utterly exhausting.

TAG: Scar_015_f
I rarely "play."

TAG: Player_007_choice_000_f
Today, you do! En garde!

TAG: Player_007_choice_001_f
This is no game...

TAG: Scar_016_f
*sigh* Your preoccupation with games is rather childish, you know?

TAG: Player_008_choice_000_f
You won't break me, Villain!

TAG: Player_008_choice_001_f
Not as pathetic as this messy lair!

TAG: Scar_017_f
No? How are you planning on turning this in your favor?

TAG: Player_009_choice_000_f
With my Pixel Sword!

TAG: Player_009_choice_001_f
I've been watching your attack patterns!

TAG: Player_009_choice_002_f
I have a battle sidekick!

TAG: Scar_018_f
A plaything for a child. Are you finished?

TAG: Scar_019_f
No, but YOU are!

TAG: Scar_020_f
Fine, yes. You "defeated" me. Now leave.

TAG: Scar_021_f
Goody for you. I really don't care.

TAG: Scar_022_f
I'll accept apathy as surrender!

TAG: Scar_023_f
The sticky little cub? Ugh, what a nuisance.

TAG: Scar_024_f
Get her out of here, and I'll declare you the victor.

TAG: Scar_025_f
Oh? You don't like my decor? I'm wounded.

TAG: Player_010_choice_000_f
You're low on health!

TAG: Player_010_choice_001_f
Living in a skull is clichÃ©!

TAG: Scar_026_f
If you mean I'm bored with this interaction, then most definitely.

TAG: Scar_027_f
If you don't like my home, I invite you to leave. Now. Oh, and don't forget the cub.

TAG: Scar_028_f
This is for real, serious Final Boss battle time!

TAG: Scar_029_f
Yes, this sounds INCREDIBLY high stakes.

TAG: Player_011_choice_000_f
I'm immune to sarcasm!

TAG: Player_011_choice_001_f
Time to use my secret weapon!

TAG: Scar_030_f
Oh woe is me, whatever will I do?

TAG: Scar_031_f
I just told you that wouldn't work! I'm more powerful than ever!

TAG: Scar_032_f
Oh dear, I'm trembling. Will you accept my surrender for your mercy?

TAG: Player_012_choice_000_f
I accept your surrender!

TAG: Player_012_choice_001_f
Better luck next time, Scar!

TAG: Scar_033_f
*sigh* Yes, I'm defeated. Now, leave.

TAG: Scar_034_f
Maybe you should think about leveling up!

TAG: Scar_035_f
I've no idea what that means. But I do know this is over. You win. We're finished. Now, go.
