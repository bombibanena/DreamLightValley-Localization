Say, Donald... do you ever feel like YOU should be in charge around here?

TAG: Donald_001_f
Well, now that ya mention it...

TAG: Donald_002_f
I'd make a great ruler!

TAG: Donald_003_f
And... does it ever make you just a little bit jealous that you're not?

TAG: Donald_004_f
Huh?! What's going on? Why are you askin' me all these funny questions?

TAG: Donald_005_f
The Forgotten needs some help finishing part of a poem about being a jealous ruler.

TAG: Donald_006_f
I guess you aren't really the right person to ask about it...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Did you want to hear the poem anyway?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I better keep looking. See you around!

TAG: Donald_007_f
Sure! I'm an excellent poet. What is it?

TAG: Donald_008_f
<Lore>I once was the ruler of all I surveyed...</Lore>

TAG: Donald_009_f
<Lore>But now I'm cast out and I feel so afraid.</Lore>

TAG: Donald_010_f
<Lore>Nothing I do seems to make the world right...</Lore>

TAG: Donald_011_f
That's it. The Forgotten needs a rhyme for "right."

TAG: Donald_012_f
There's your problem. No good poetry words rhyme with "right"!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
"Fight"?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
"Fright"?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
"Flight"?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
"Satellite"?

TAG: Donald_013_f
Ha-ha-ha! That would be a ridiculous way to end that poem.

TAG: Donald_014_f
I'm gonna go write my own poem, and then you'll see true genius!

TAG: Donald_015_f
Well, okay. But in the meantime...

TAG: Donald_016_f
I have to keep looking for a <Lore>jealous wannabe ruler</Lore>...

TAG: Donald_017_f
Okay, but remember: If you ever need help with poems OR ruling the Valley, come see me!

TAG: Donald_018_f
I'll keep that in mind. But for now...
