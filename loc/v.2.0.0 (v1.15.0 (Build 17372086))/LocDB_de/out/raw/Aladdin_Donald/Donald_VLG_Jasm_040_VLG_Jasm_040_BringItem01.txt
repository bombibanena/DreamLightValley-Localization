Thank you, {PlayerName}. I feel much better since the fish disappeared.

TAG: Donald_001_f
It seemed to be a pretty overwhelming situation! I'm glad I could help you out.

TAG: Donald_002_f
Now that I'm not smelling fish, I remembered something that you might want to know.

TAG: Donald_005_f
What is it?

TAG: Donald_003_f
I saw Anna today. Usually, she's pretty happy, but she seemed upset.

TAG: Donald_006_f
She kept mumbling something about her House being in "chocolate chaos." Seemed peculiar to me.

Oh boy. I'm going to <Lore>talk to Anna</Lore> and see what's going on.
