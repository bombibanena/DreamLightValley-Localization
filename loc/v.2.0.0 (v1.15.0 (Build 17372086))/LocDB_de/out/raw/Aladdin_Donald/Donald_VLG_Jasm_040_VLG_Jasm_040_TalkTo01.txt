Hello, Donald! I heard you were having a problem with some fish?

TAG: Donald_001_f
That's one way to put it.

TAG: Donald_002_f
I'm being TORMENTED by old stinky fish!

TAG: Donald_003_f
Fish, fish, fish! Everywhere fish! And not even nice fresh fish either!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Did someone bring them to you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why not throw them out?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sounds like you need less fish.

TAG: Donald_004_f
No! They just appeared out of nowhere!

TAG: Donald_007_f
It must be some sort of FISH MAGIC!

TAG: Donald_008_f
Wait... Fish magic or WISH magic?

TAG: Donald_009_f
Huh?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Did you wish for these fish to appear?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You know what I mean.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Never mind; it's probably just fish magic.

TAG: Donald_010_f
Um... Maybe. BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT! I was just so frustrated by how few fish I was catching.

TAG: Donald_017_f
And did you WISH for them?

TAG: Donald_018_f
Well sure, I guess I did, but what does that have to do with anything?

TAG: Donald_019_f
I think some sort of wish magic is loose in the Valley, but I can't be sure just yet.

TAG: Donald_022_f
Let me <Lore>clean up the stinky fish</Lore> for you, and then I'll figure out how to get to the bottom of this.

TAG: Donald_011_f
No, I don't.

TAG: Donald_013_f
Come on; something tells me you wished for these fish, didn't you?

TAG: Donald_015_f
Maybe I WAS frustrated by how few fish I was catching...

TAG: Donald_012_f
Okay, but WHAT is fish magic, anyway?!

TAG: Donald_014_f
I have no idea. Has anything else unusual happened lately?

TAG: Donald_016_f
No. But I HAVE been frustrated by how few fish I've been catching...

TAG: Donald_005_f
I tried that! But the more I pick up, the more appear all over my House!

TAG: Donald_006_f
I KNOW that! But they just appeared out of nowhere!
