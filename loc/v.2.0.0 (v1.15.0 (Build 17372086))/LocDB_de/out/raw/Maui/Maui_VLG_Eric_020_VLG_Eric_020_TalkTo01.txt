Hey, {PlayerName}! How can I help you today? Got a giant crab bothering you? Want me to lasso a star?

TAG: Player_000_f
You're a shapeshifter, right? Ariel needs a way to turn back and forth from human to mermaid...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Can you teach Ariel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
How does it work?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
How common is this kind of magic?

TAG: Maui_000_f
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on. I CAN shapeshift but only because of the power of my magic hook.

TAG: Maui_001_f
And before you ask, no, you can't borrow it. Magic hooks are very personal.

TAG: Maui_002_f
You could try creating an enchanted object yourself. I mean, you're full of Dreamlight magic, right? Who knows. It could work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I'll do that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Would it be that simple?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm not sure I'm powerful enough.

TAG: Maui_003_f
That's what I like to hear, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Maui_010_f
You've got this.

TAG: Maui_006_f
Okay, so if I'm going to help Ariel and Eric... I need to enchant something.

TAG: Maui_013_f
I'll need something with Dreamlight magic in it. Maybe some <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Maui_017_f
But if I'm going to be messing with Dreamlight magic, I'll need something to ground the spell, something from the earth. Maybe some <ActivityItem>White Impatiens</ActivityItem> flowers...

TAG: Maui_018_f
... Oh, and a <ActivityItem>Vial</ActivityItem> to mix it all up in!

TAG: Maui_019_f
Sounds like Merlin's rubbing off on you, kid. You're definitely getting the hang of this magic stuff.

TAG: Maui_014_f
Of course, once you've got all that junk, you'll need something to enchant. Maybe Eric can help you figure that part out.

TAG: Maui_015_f
Have a good time enchanting stuff, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Maui_004_f
Simple? No, it won't be simple. But if anyone can manage it, it's you.

TAG: Maui_005_f
Hey, I didn't defeat a giant crab by doubting myself. It's a challenge, {PlayerName}. A part of your legend.
