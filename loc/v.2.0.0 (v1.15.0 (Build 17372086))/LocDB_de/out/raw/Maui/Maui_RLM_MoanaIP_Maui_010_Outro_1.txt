Now what did you need?

TAG: Maui_015_f
Can you help me clear the debris on the Beach so I can free Moana's canoe?

TAG: Maui_016_f
Sure. Gimme that Pickaxe I see you've got. I'll make it as strong as my hook.

TAG: Maui_018_f
There you go! Gift from a demigod. Now, go free that canoe.

TAG: Maui_052_f
You don't know everything about me, but that's okay. I mean, you're only human.

TAG: Maui_021_f
Uh. No. I can swim just fine without my fishhook.

TAG: Maui_001_f
But why argue with results, right? Particularly when results are delicious coconuts.

TAG: Maui_019_f
No. Well, I guess... kind of? Since I can shapeshift into a hawk? But no.

TAG: Maui_020_f
Uh. No. I can swim just fine without my fishhook.

TAG: Maui_002_f
I buried an eel.

TAG: Maui_022_f
No. Well, I guess... kind of? Since I can shapeshift into a hawk? But no.

The correct answer is Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea, hero to all!

TAG: Maui_011_f
Nope! I buried an eel.

TAG: Maui_012_f
Good guess, though.

TAG: Maui_013_f
Okay, final question: What power do I get from my fishhook?

TAG: Maui_003_f
Yes! I gotta admit, I was kind of surprised when that happened.

TAG: Maui_004_f
But why argue with results, right? Particularly when results are delicious coconuts.

TAG: Maui_005_f
Let's see if you can get them all right...

Final question: What power do I get from my fishhook?

TAG: Maui_024_f
No. Well, I guess... kind of? Since I can shapeshift into a hawk? But no.

TAG: Maui_007_f
What? I'd never bury my fishhook! I need that thing!

TAG: Maui_008_f
I buried an eel.

TAG: Maui_009_f
Speaking of fishhooks, though...
