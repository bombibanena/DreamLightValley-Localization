{PlayerName}! Got a question for you. Which of these do you think is the BEST animal to turn into...

TAG: Maui_001_f
Sneaky beetle? Fearsome shark? Or awesome, powerful, giant hawk?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Definitely the hawk.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I like the idea of sneaking around as a beetle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I personally like shark head.

TAG: Maui_002_f
Good choice! You have power, you have flight. There is literally no downside to being a hawk.

It has its uses. But you gotta be careful when you're tiny. A chicken might try to eat you.

You like... Oh great. Moana told you about that, didn't she? I make a mistake shape-shifting one time, and I never hear the end of it!
