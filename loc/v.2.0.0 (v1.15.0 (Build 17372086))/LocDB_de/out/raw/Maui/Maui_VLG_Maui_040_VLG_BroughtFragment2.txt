Of course the <ActivityItem>Heart of Dreamlight Valley</ActivityItem> is still broken. Got any ideas?

TAG: Player_000_f
We should...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ask Merlin.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Repair it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Put the pieces back on the statue.

TAG: Maui_002_f
That works. You should definitely do that.

TAG: Maui_004_f
Yeah, simple repairs won't work on the <ActivityItem>Heart of Dreamlight Valley</ActivityItem>.

Sorry, the Heart of Dreamlight Valley's still broken. Which means it's basically useless.
