So, what did you find?

TAG: Maui_000_f
A piece of sandstone, huh?

TAG: Maui_001_f
Whoa! That made me remember something! I brought fire to Dreamlight Valley before the Forgetting!

TAG: Maui_002_f
There was a bowl-shaped fire source from my ocean, but I haven't seen it around anywhere.

TAG: Maui_003_f
Yes! That's my next gift to the Village! We're going to recreate it. What do you say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can't you do it yourself?

TAG: Maui_004_f
I knew I liked you.

TAG: Maui_006_f
Okay, now listen carefully... Use this piece of sandstone to make a new one.

TAG: Maui_007_f
You'll also need some <ActivityItem>Sand</ActivityItem>, Rocks, Coal, and Red Flowers... Like those Penstemons in the Plaza.

When you've got it all, put it together at that crafting place you have. Then put the fire source â inspired by yours truly â somewhere in the Village.

Obviously. But I thought I'd give you a chance to be awesome too. Don't worry. I've got your back.
