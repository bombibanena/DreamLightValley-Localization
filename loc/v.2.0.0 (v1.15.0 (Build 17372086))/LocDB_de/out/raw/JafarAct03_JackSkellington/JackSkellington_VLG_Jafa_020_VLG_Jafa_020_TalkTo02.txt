Hi, Jack! How's the scientific research going?

TAG: JackSkellington_002_f
Brilliantly! I'm very close to isolating an essence of Easter chocolate!

TAG: JackSkellington_003_f
Cool! Think I could get some advice from you?

TAG: JackSkellington_000_f
I'm trying to track down some of the Essences around here. What do you know about them?

TAG: JackSkellington_013_f
Well, that depends on what you already know. Shall I explain the distinction between Major and Minor Essences?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, please!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Nah, I'm fine; go on.

TAG: JackSkellington_023_f
They combine at a 3:1 ratio â three Minor Essences to one Major. However, knowing which ones to mix to get the result you want can be difficult.

TAG: JackSkellington_010_f
The <ActivityItem>Essence of Wonder</ActivityItem> is most interesting and very relevant to my work.

TAG: JackSkellington_011_f
Cool. Maybe Jafar and I should try to work with that one too. How did you isolate it?

TAG: JackSkellington_021_f
Sadly, I've never been able to...

TAG: JackSkellington_022_f
Though I do know that one of its components is the <ActivityItem>Minor Essence of Excitement</ActivityItem>. Perhaps if you try, you'll have better luck!

TAG: JackSkellington_012_f
Here, take this <ActivityItem>Holiday Seed</ActivityItem>. If you plant it, it will grow into a special tree.

TAG: JackSkellington_015_f
Then you and Jafar should be able to extract the <ActivityItem>Essence of Excitement</ActivityItem> from that.

TAG: JackSkellington_017_f
Oh, and {PlayerName}... has anyone told you about the <ActivityItem>Emotive Essences</ActivityItem>?

TAG: JackSkellington_018_f
Oh, no â what are those?

TAG: JackSkellington_019_f
Extremely elusive Essences. They can't be refined from any item or resource. Instead, you must perform actions to call them forth from Dreamlight.

TAG: JackSkellington_014_f
I know of the <ActivityItem>Essence of Benevolence</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Essence of Wisdom</ActivityItem>, but there could be even more!

TAG: JackSkellington_016_f
Perfect, thanks Jack!

TAG: JackSkellington_020_f
Why don't you take this? Wouldn't want you to forget.

TAG: JackSkellington_004_f
I'm helping Jafar with some alchemy and well... it seems like things function differently in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: JackSkellington_005_f
Of course! I ran into that exact same issue. I had to redo all my prior experiments!

TAG: JackSkellington_006_f
Think you could share some of the discoveries you've made to point us in the right direction?

TAG: JackSkellington_007_f
Well, I've come to the conclusion that the Valley has a number of <Lore>Essences</Lore> at the heart of its magic.

TAG: JackSkellington_008_f
How fascinating!

TAG: JackSkellington_009_f
Indeed! I hypothesize that there are dozens of Essences. However, I've only managed to explore one of them.
