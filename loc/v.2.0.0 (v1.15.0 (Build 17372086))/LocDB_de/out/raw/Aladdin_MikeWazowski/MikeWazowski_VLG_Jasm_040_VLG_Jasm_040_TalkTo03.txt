Hello, Mike! I've heard some things are going a little funny over here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
{PlayerName}! Am I glad to see you!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
It's the craziest thing. I was minding my own business, thinking about being the funniest guy in the Valley, and BAM! Wherever I go, EVERYONE laughs at me!

So you got what you wanted!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You were already the funniest guy here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That doesn't sound right.

Not exactly. Now everyone laughs AT me, even if I'm just standin' there. I may be hilarious, but I'm also sensitive! It's complex.

I think I need to see this to believe it. Can you demonstrate?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Sure. <Lore>Follow me to Mr. McDuck's store</Lore> and I'll show ya what I mean.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
I am, aren't I? But that's beside the point! I've got a real problem here!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Now, everyone's laughing AT me, even if I'm just standing there. To tell ya the truth, it's startin' to hurt my feelings.

It ISN'T right! Something has gone terribly WRONG!
