It is a <ActivityItem>Potion Set</ActivityItem>! I still wasn't sure you were being honest, you know.

Do you like it?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
Like it?! I love it! If Triton had treated me this kindly...

How did you guess I needed one?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It just felt right.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I thought long and hard.

What's that, {PlayerName}?

Err, I uh... just wanted to make sure that we're cool now.

TAG: Ursula_016_f

No need to get into that now. Wouldn't want to spoil the mood.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
See you soon, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Ursula_017_f
Exactly!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Finally, someone treating me the way I deserve to be treated!

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Well, aren't you a dear!
