Hey Remy, got a bit of an unusual question for you.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Sure, {PlayerName}. What's up?

TAG: Remy_003_f
I'm helping Sally build a <ActivityItem>Compost Bin</ActivityItem>, and we need some <ActivityItem>Vegetable Trimmings</ActivityItem> to get things going.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Do you have any that we could take off of your hands?

TAG: Remy_005_f
Absolutely!

TAG: Remy_006_f
Don't get me wrong, {PlayerName} â I do my best to reduce food waste here.

TAG: Remy_007_f
But even at my most efficient, I still end up with piles of rinds, skins, and produce trimmings.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I've never been so excited by potato peels!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're... not already rotting, are they?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do I get paid as your new garbage-removal person?

TAG: Remy_010_f
There are actually a lot of things you can do with potato skins in the kitchen.

TAG: Remy_012_f
But these carrot skins and other stuff are all yours.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Here you go. <ActivityItem>Vegetable Trimmings</ActivityItem> for you and Sally!

TAG: Remy_009_f
Awesome, thanks Remy!

TAG: Remy_011_f
No, no. These are just from the last day or so.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Sure! As long as you're happy getting paid in food.

TAG: Remy_014_f
Great!
