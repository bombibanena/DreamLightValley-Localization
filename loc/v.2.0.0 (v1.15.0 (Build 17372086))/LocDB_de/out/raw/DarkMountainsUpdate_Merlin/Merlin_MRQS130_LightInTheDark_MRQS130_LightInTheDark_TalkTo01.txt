Observe! There, on the roof of Mickey's House... It's not just the rips in the sky. There's Dark Magic bleeding through the very fabric of reality.

Fortunately, the phenomenon is quite localized. Only certain places seem to be affected...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe these places were important to the Forgotten?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Probably just a coincidence?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can you spell it out for me? No time for riddles.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Yes, though I hypothesize that it's not the places themselves... but something inside of them.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Coincidence?! This is Dreamlight Valley, {PlayerName}! Nothing here is mere coincidence.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I hypothesize that each spot must hold something important to the Forgotten. Something left behind.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
And it appears they're still imbued with the Forgotten's magic.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
You'll have to <Lore>search Mickey's House</Lore> for anything like that. It could be something quite mundane...

Yes well, I'm conversing as swiftly as comprehension allows!
