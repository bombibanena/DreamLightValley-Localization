Now, let's see... Ah, a book of fairy tales...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Oh dear, it's positively saturated with Dark Magic. It must have been the Forgotten's once. There's no other explanation.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
We've got something that belonged to the Forgotten. What's next?

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I'm afraid for this enchantment; we'll need at least <Lore>three more Forgotten Relics</Lore> just like this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Will they look just like this one?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Where do I find them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sounds like a wild goose chase to me...

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Well, some might be quite special, but others could be more mundane. However, they'll all have Dark Magic emanating from them, just like this one does.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
To find them, you must keep an eye out for more places where Dark Magic is bleeding through into our world. They could be anywhere in the Village.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Got it. Find the <ActivityItem>Relics</ActivityItem>, save the Village.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Ah! Ah! That's not all. We also must obtain the story behind each <ActivityItem>Relic</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Stories hold a magic all their own, {PlayerName}. Uncover the stories... and you'll be able to harness the magic.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
You must discover why these things were of such importance to the Forgotten. You found the first one in Mickey's House. Perhaps Mickey knows the story behind it...

TAG: Merlin_027_f
I'll <Lore>look around the Village... and go talk to Mickey</Lore>. Thanks, Merlin.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
You must keep an eye out for more places where Dark Magic is seeping through into our world. They could be anywhere in the Village.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Some of the <ActivityItem>Relics</ActivityItem> might be quite special. Others more mundane. But they'll all have Dark Magic emanating from them, just like this one does.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
How am I supposed to even know what I'm looking for?
