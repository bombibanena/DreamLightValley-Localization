Being Remy's delivery person is EXHAUSTING.

And you're very good at it. Even though everyone in the Village comes from different places...

TAG: Anna_004_f
...you still find a way to make us all feel welcome and comfortable here. That's really admirable.

TAG: Anna_005_f
Thanks again for the delivery. Here, this is for you!

TAG: Anna_006_f
Oh, it is! Though it takes a little getting used to if you've never had it before.

TAG: Anna_007_f
You'll have to join us for dinner sometime!

TAG: Anna_008_f
It sure seems like it. But I bet you're learning some new recipes, right?
