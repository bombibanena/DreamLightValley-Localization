Hey Mr. McDuck, have you ever wanted an employee at your shop?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Hmm, can't say I've had a need for one in the past. I like being hands-on in my shop. Especially at the cash register.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Haven't you ever wanted a little vacation?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Well... I might be interested. Do you have anyone in mind to fill in?

Okay, so hear me out...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Absolutely!

Interesting...

I heard his little foray into the restaurant business didn't go so well.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Oh, he's moved past that now. He needs a role with a little more cachet and your shop just oozes class!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Well, when ya put it like that, I suppose I could take a short break. But YOU need to keep an eye on him in case there are fires that need puttin' out.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Deal!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Oh, I'm not gonna like this suggestion, am I?

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
It's Hades!
