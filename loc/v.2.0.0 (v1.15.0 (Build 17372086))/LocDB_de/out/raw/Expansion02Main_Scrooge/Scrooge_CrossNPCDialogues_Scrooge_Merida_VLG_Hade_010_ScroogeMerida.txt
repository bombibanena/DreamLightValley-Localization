Mr. McDuck, I'd love to hear your opinion. What do you think of these new statues?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
They're pleasant enough. But if they'd had a more inspiring model, I'd be happy to stock 'em in my shop!

Wasn't there a god who threw lightning bolts? I think the Lorekeeper told me about him.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Aye, lass. That'd be Zeus! He'd make a much more regal figure.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Shame this one doesn't have real lightning. That'd make it heaps more exciting!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Hmm, wasn't there a lightning machine not too far from the Lorekeeper?
