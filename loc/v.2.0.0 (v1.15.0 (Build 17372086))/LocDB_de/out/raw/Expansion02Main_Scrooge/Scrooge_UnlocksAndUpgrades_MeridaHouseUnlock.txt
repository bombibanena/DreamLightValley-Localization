One home for Merida that'll make the lass feel like she's back on the Scottish moors â coming right up!

Och, you haven't got enough Star Coins to cover even the materials for Merida's home! Come back later when ya have more.

Don't wait too long, {PlayerName}. Merida needs a home soon or she'll be stuck sleepin' out under the stars.
