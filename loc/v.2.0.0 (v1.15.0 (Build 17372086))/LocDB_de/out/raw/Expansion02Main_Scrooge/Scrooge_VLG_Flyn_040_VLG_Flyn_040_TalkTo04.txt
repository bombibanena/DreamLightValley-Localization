Ah, {PlayerName}! I was hoping to see you.

Has Flynn Rider decided to take me up on my offer to publish his book?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We've decided to go in a different direction.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Actually, we need you for something even BETTER!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Um... uh... no comment?

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Och, don't tell me you're goin' with Goofy?

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Goofy would have done a great job! But... no, we've decided to self-publish instead.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Self-publish? What an interesting choice. I suppose I can see how that'd work.

To help market, we're organizing a book signing. I'll need to order an <ActivityItem>Ink and Feather Set</ActivityItem> to get things set up.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Well, at least you're here to do SOME business. Let's get you sorted!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Better? What do you mean?

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Well, we've decided to self-publish the book instead.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
That sounds suspiciously like you have NOT chosen me to publish the book.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Unfortunately no. We've decided to self-publish instead.
