Hey, Mr. McDuck! How'd you like Hades' talk?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Ah, well I was already buying my produce from Goofy's Stall, so I dinnae think I was the intended audience.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
But the merchandise there... well that certainly piqued my interest!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Daisy did a great job, didn't she?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're a Hades fan?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh? How so?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Aye, she did!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
But let's just say that I was more interested in the business opportunity I saw.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Limited-run merchandise can become very valuable in the right markets!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
So I bought out Hades' stock! I think I'll sit on it for a time, and then I'll bring it back to market and make myself a pretty penny.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Smart!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't think Hades will like that...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's hilarious.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Why, thank you!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Why not? He still gets paid for his merchandise.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
I think he was more in it for the fans and acclaim than to make money.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Well, to each their own!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
There's nothin' funny about smart business practices!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Ha! Not in the least!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Let's just say I saw a business opportunity...
