Of course! I love being outside in the Village! I really like doing things outdoors.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Tell me, what's your favorite thing to do outside?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Reading under a tree.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Go for a walk with my critter.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Take a nap on the beach.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Oh, I love to read! What sort of books are your favorites?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Fantasy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Fairy tales.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Science fiction.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
That sounds like a great way to visit imaginative and magical places...

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I'll have to find some fantasy books in Merlin's library!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Hmm... Are there any fairy tales about charming thieves who TRY to do the right thing?

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
And have a happily-ever-after at the end?

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
I'm not sure what that is but, if you like it, I'm sure it's wonderful!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
How fun! Do you think you'd like to go for a walk with a chameleon?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'd love to!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
We'd need a very tiny leash.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
He might get lost.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Great! I know just the chameleon.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
When we find him, you, me, and Pascal can all explore together!

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Well, the chameleon I'm thinking about wouldn't need a leash. Pascal is VERY well behaved... unless you beat him at chess.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Well, the chameleon I'm thinking about never gets lost. He even stayed with me when we had to escape from an underwater cave.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Oh, I don't know if I could rest at the beach. There's so much to do!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Like swimming?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Like collecting shells?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Like painting the ocean?

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
I... don't know how to swim.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
But I'm excited to learn!

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
Yes! Think of all the things you can make with those shells!

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Necklaces, treasure boxes, new paints...

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Paint... the ocean? How wouldâ

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Oh! You mean make paintings OF the ocean!

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
Guess I'm so used to painting on walls, I forget that you can take canvas and paints wherever you go.
