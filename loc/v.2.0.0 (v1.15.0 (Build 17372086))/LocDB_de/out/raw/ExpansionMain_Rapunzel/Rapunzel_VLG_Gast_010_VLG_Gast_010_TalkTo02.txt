Hey Rapunzel, how are you enjoying the party?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
It's... Well, the dÃ©cor is interesting, isn't it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I call it "Retro Rugged."

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Don't look at me. That's all Gaston.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Gaston looks happy with the way it turned out.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
You don't think it's a little much?

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
It seems to suit him. And I can't really judge. You might think the decorations were odd in the place where I was hiding in the jungle.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
I can't even imagine what Mother would have said...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sure it was lovely!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No need to show her if you don't want.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Thank you... Wow, it's so nice to be around people again!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Though I did meet Gaston once when I was exploring.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
I'm so glad he's come out of his shell now.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Really? He was more restrained in the past?

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Well, he just seemed... lonely. He was building himself a friend out of coconuts.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
When he saw me, he tried to pretend it wasn't there... It was kind of awkward.

TAG: Rapunzel_000_f
Oh, that tracks. He was a little sensitive about being so lonely. I think he just needed a friend... even if it was a friend made of coconuts.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I'll let you get back to the gathering now. Have fun!
