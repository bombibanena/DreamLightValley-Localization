Oh! Oh wow. You're not a jungle friend. You're a... person!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
I mean, hello!

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Hi there!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're surprised to see a person?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you lost?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I love your braid!

TAG: Rapunzel_033_f
I haven't seen another person in this jungle since... well, since it became a jungle.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Wow. Okay... Uh, what's a "jungle friend"?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Oh. Jungle friends are what I call the animals here. The ones trotting around on all fours? They have fuzzy snouts, the sweetest ears, and come in all sorts of different colors!

TAG: Rapunzel_037_f
You must mean the capybaras!

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Capybaras? Is that what they're called? That's amazing! And it's amazing that you're here too!

TAG: Rapunzel_038_f
It's nice to meet you. I'm {PlayerName}.

TAG: Rapunzel_039_f
It's nice to meet you too, {PlayerName}. My name's Rapunzel.

TAG: Rapunzel_040_f
Hm... I wonder if you can help me? I'm looking for a Jewel of Time.

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Shiny? Magical? Vital to keeping Eternity Isle from imminent destruction.

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
Eternity Isle's in trouble? But... the capybaras live here!

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
I'm going to stop it... but I need the Jewel to do that.

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
Hmm... I've looked all over this jungle for my missing paints, and I've found lots of beautiful rocks... but not any magical ones before today.

TAG: Rapunzel_023_f
See those <Lore>Gray Floating Rocks</Lore>? I can't get past them to search beyond this <Lore>Ancient Door</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_024_f
The rocks seem pretty magical... Are they what you're looking for?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
They're time anomalies.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
No, but this might be my answer.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Hmm, I'll need a closer look.

TAG: Rapunzel_026_f
"Time anomalies"? That sounds so interesting! Do you know how to get past them?

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I do! Just leave it to me.

TAG: Rapunzel_028_f
I'll <Lore>clear away these Gray Floating Rocks</Lore> so we can get a closer look at this door.

TAG: Rapunzel_025_f
That would be amazing, if both our answers were just one door away!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
There's only one way to find out.

TAG: Rapunzel_027_f
Please do! I'm running out of ideas.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
So, it wasn't always a jungle?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who was the last person you saw?

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
No, it used to be just sand and ruins. You could see all the way to the mainland from the tower where I lived.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Then one day, I woke up and there was a jungle outside! The tower was suddenly really old and crumbling... and Mother didn't visit!

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
You mean Mother Gothel? She used to visit you here?

TAG: Rapunzel_029_f
Almost every day. When she stopped, I got so worried.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I left the tower to look for her, and I've been exploring this amazing jungle ever since.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
Who's "Mother"?

TAG: Rapunzel_030_f
Oh â my mother. Mother Gothel? She raised me in another tower back in our home, and then we came here... She used to visit almost every day.

TAG: Rapunzel_031_f
And she just stopped showing up?

TAG: Rapunzel_032_f
Yes... It was very strange.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Well, I met a man on the desert half of the Isle.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
I think his name is Gaston?

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
I asked him if the Valley is dangerous like Mother always warned me. But he said the mainland is so "not dangerous" it's "boring"!

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
I knew that meant Mother wasn't being honest with me again. It's happened before... Then I came back here to the jungle to think about things.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
He's big, like my friend Attila. And he talked about himself a lot.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Me? Oh, no. I know my way around here pretty well. But you're new...

TAG: Rapunzel_034_f
Thank you! The flowers are falling out a little, but... what can you do? That's adventuring, right?

TAG: Rapunzel_035_f
It looks great!

TAG: Rapunzel_036_f
Thanks... Wow, it is so nice to have someone to talk to!
