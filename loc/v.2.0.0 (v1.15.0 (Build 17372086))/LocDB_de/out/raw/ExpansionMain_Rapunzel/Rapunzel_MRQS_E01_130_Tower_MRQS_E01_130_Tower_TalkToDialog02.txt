Look! The tower walls are too mossy and crumbly to climb.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
We'll have to find another way to save the Isle. Let's get away from this place, okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We're not giving up so easily.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why are you suddenly so afraid?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There is no other way!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
All we need is a way to climb up there. A rope with a grappling hook or a ladder... You could hold it steady for me; you don't even have to go inside.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
No! You can't go up there alone. It's cursed!

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
The tower is cursed? Since when?

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Since... I'm not sure... Sometimes I see a shadow of Mother in the window staring down at me... She always looks so disappointed.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sure it's another magical echo.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We can get through this together.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Have you checked your stress levels lately?

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
An echo of what? What if it's something dark? Something dangerous?

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
Maybe what you saw was a combination of the Jewel of Time's power and your feelings about Mother Gothel?

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
I might need your help to stop it. Whatever it is.

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
All right... Okay. Yes! If you need me, I'm here.

TAG: Rapunzel_023_f
Great! So, how do we get up there?

TAG: Rapunzel_024_f
Hmm... Well, Mother once told me a story about a boy who grew a huge beanstalk to reach a giant in the clouds.

TAG: Rapunzel_025_f
But because he disobeyed his Mother to buy the magic beans, the giant gobbled him up!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
That's not how "Jack and the Beanstalk" goes...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Oh yeah... That story...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You're saying we need a giant?

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I'll get my friend Mickey to tell you the real version sometime.

TAG: Rapunzel_027_f
But I DO like the growing and climbing idea...

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
I've seen some pretty strong vines <Lore>growing on the Plains in the Glittering Dunes</Lore>. Maybe we could get some seeds and grow vines here to climb the tower?

TAG: Rapunzel_029_f
Oh, but the vines won't be tall enough for a really long time...

TAG: Rapunzel_028_f
I've got an idea. We have my Hourglass. If I <Lore>find a few Vine Seeds in the Oasis</Lore>, I can plant them here and speed things up.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
We'll be climbing the tower in no time! ... Literally.

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
... Okay... If you're sure... Maybe you can find some <Lore>Vine Seeds</Lore> in the Oasis.

TAG: Rapunzel_030_f
I'll stay here and watch the tower window... just in case.

TAG: Rapunzel_026_f
I remember it a little differently.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
No, I was thinking we need a beanstalk!

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Unless you know an actual giant. One who's friendly and won't gobble us up.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
I have a lot of interesting friends in the Valley, but no giants.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
I won't let this curse â our whatever it is â hurt you, Rapunzel, but I can't let it stop me. Eternity Isle depends on it.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Stress can make you see lots of things...

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
It's not my imagination. I REALLY have seen her in the window.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
*sigh* I should have told you the first time we heard the echo of Mother's voice... I think the tower is cursed.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
But what if we just have to look harder? Starting anywhere but here?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Why are you trying to back out of this now...?
