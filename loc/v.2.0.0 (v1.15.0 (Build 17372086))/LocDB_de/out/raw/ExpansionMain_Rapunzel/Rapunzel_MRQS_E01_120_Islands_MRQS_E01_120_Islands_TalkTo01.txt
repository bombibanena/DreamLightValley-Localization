Whoa! Did you feel that? The platform moved a little...

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
And it made a ticking sound... Just like a clock!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
A clock that's missing a few parts... I think we have to repair this <Lore>Sundial mechanism</Lore> in the center to get to the far island.

TAG: Rapunzel_000_f
It looks like someone has pulled out the gears...

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
That's strange. Hmm...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
I've seen some <Lore>golden gears floating around the Isle</Lore>. Maybe that's what we need to repair the Sundial?

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
It's worth a try. I'll <Lore>search the Isle for Sundial Gears</Lore>.
