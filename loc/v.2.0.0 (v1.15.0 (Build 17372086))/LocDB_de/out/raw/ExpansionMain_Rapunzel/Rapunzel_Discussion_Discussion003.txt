{PlayerName}, I was wondering... Do you think it's ever okay to break the rules?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No, rules are meant to protect us.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I was BORN to break rules!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That depends on the rule...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
That's what Mother always says too.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
But now that I'm outside the tower, I think some of her rules might be a little, uh...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Overprotective?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Extreme!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Totally made up.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Yes, exactly! I'm taking care of myself just fine... Right?

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I guess that's one word for it...

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
... I never thought of it that way. But... aren't all rules made up by someone?

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
I really need to think about this.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Wow, that's really rebellious! Sometimes, I wish I was more like that.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're more rebellious than you think.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Just do whatever you want!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You might be too sweet to be rebellious.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Huh... I guess I am.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
I did leave the tower. AND I handled myself fine in the jungle!

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
I suppose I could try...

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
I just need to figure out what that would be.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Hmm... But isn't it possible to be nice and still follow your dreams?

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I'd like to think there's room for both.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Mother's rules always seemed helpful... until they weren't.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
It's so complicated. Not always bad... Not always good...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Like a gray area.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Like sandwiches?

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
Exactly!

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Maybe rules are like paints? You have to mix them to get the color you want.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Does that make sense?

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
I don't know about that â since meeting you, I haven't had a bad sandwich.

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
Anna would never let that happen!
