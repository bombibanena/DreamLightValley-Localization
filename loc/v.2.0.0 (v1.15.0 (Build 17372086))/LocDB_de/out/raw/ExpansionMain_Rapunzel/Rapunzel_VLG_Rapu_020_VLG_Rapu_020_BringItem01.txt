Chef Remy sends his best regards. He was dreaming of a dish that would inspire him in the kitchen again, and the one I made did the trick. He wanted you to try it, too.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Oh! It's spicy! And delicious â it might be my new favorite thing since French bread!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Thank you so much for helping Remy. While you were doing that, I figured out whose dream should be next on our list. Ready? ...

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Gaston!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Five-dozen-eggs Gaston?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Go on...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did you hit your head dune surfing?

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Boot-stomping, bragging, self-centered Gaston?

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Gaston with an ego bigger than Eternity Isle? THAT Gaston?

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Yep.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Gaston's had a pretty difficult time on the Isle. Don't you think he deserves his dream just like anyone?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Good point â I'm in!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What do we think Gaston dreams about?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
If you're sure...

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Thank you. All right, here's what I'm thinking...

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
We make Gaston feel like a hero by giving him the chance to rescue me â a "damsel in distress" â from a horrible creature in my tower!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You're not a damsel in distress!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
But you're no damsel in distress, and there are no creatures here...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
It's a little clichÃ©...

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
Of course not, but I've read about them in a book from Merlin's library. I think I could pretend to be one.

TAG: Rapunzel_026_f
PLUS we're going to build an amazing creature he can save me from.

TAG: Rapunzel_027_f
... Okay... What do we need to make this creature?

TAG: Rapunzel_028_f
I was thinking papier-mÃ¢chÃ©. I've made lots of masks before, so this shouldn't be too tough.

TAG: Rapunzel_029_f
We'll need <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> and something to keep it from sticking to the molds. Hmm...

TAG: Rapunzel_030_f
Well... <ActivityItem>Plastic Scrap</ActivityItem> could work here. I'll find some.

TAG: Rapunzel_031_f
Great! I'll also need some creepy crawly things like <ActivityItem>Scorpions</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Piranhas</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Rapunzel_032_f
I'll go gather the supplies!

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Thanks! And I'm going to do a sketch of our creature to plan the design.

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
We know that, but Gaston doesn't.

TAG: Rapunzel_023_f
Plus, I'm going to build us our very own creature.

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
But that's why it could work, right? Damsel, creature, hero! It's in so many stories I've read in Merlin's library.

TAG: Rapunzel_024_f
Well, it's easy enough for Gaston to figure out. Maybe you're right; that's just what we need.

TAG: Rapunzel_025_f
That and our very own homemade creature.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
Shinier boots? A monument to his hair?

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Maybe, but I think I might have an idea that's even more Gaston.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
I'm VERY sure. Here's my plan...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Well, most of the Villagers seem to avoid him.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
And it seems to me that he spends all his time just trying to get them to like him.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Maybe if he tried a tactic other than bragging about how great he is, they would.

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
No, it's nothing like that.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
I just noticed that all he wants is for someone around here to like him.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Seems like he likes himself enough... Are you sure you want to make his dream come true?
