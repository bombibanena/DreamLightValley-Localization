Did you hear that, {PlayerName}?! I just heard Mother's voice again! And look â these strange rocks just appeared.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I heard her voice too! Just remember it's not REALLY her... It's some kind of magic.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Right... Okay... I will TRY not to worry about that. Did you find the <ActivityItem>Vine Seeds</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
I did!

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
That's fantastic! While you were gone, I cleared a spot for each vine. All you have to do is <Lore>plant them</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Once I put them down, my Hourglass can take care of the rest. We'll have instant vines! Are you ready, Rapunzel?

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
No... Yes?

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
... Yes. This is what we have to do.
