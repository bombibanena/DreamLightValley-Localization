Well, here we are. *sigh*

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Is something wrong?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
No, no. It's just... sometimes the tower feels like my first friend here... and sometimes it feels like the past.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Those are some complex feelings.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The tower is your friend...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
The past can't hurt you.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
I guess they are. But what I really want is for this place to look the way I remember it.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I was thinking we could start with a ladder.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
How about a door? Then you can come and go without climbing. And friends can easily visit you.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
It even looks like there's an old one hidden here. We just have to fix it up!

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Really?! Oh, I've always wanted my own door!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I can take care of that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why not dream bigger?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're a-DOOR-able!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
I'm gonna have a door... with a knob, and hinges, and I can open it whenever I want!

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
I just need to gather some materials to fix it. I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Zinc</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Tin</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Soil</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Those should be easy to find around the Isle.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Once you find it all, could you <Lore>bring everything to me</Lore>? I'd love to learn how to fix a door.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
I've done some woodworking on a few tiny chameleon houses, but never a human-sized door!

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
You've got it! We can fix it together.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}! ... Woo-hoo! I'm gonna have my own door!!!

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Oh, I have lots of dreams, but I guess you could say they all start with an open door. That was always the one thing that was missing.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
Not for long!

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
Ha-ha-ha! That was very funny.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
Well, I'm funny and handy too â one door coming right up!

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Yep. I used to talk to the walls as I painted them â they know all my thoughts and dreams.

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
So, I'd really love to keep working on my designs.

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
You're right. Especially if we keep looking forward and focus on the amazing present!
