{PlayerName}? Hello! It's so great to see you! Is there something I can help with?

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Yes, I'm looking for a magical item... It may have been in the Wild Tangle for some time now.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Oh! What sort of item? Could it be part of one of my hobby projects?

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Half of a scarab, made of brass or a similar metal.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I don't think I've ever found anything like that.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
But... there is one spot in <Lore>the Grove</Lore>...

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
I always hear the buzzing of lots of insects coming from there. But it's been blocked off for a long time.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
And scarabs are bugs, right? Maybe it means something!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Nooooo, I hate bugs!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A clue!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Oh, I don't mind them. They're one of Pascal's favorite snacks.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
I guess I'll <Lore>go check it out</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
I'm so curious now. Please let me know what you find!

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Sure, I can <Lore>take some photos</Lore> for you â that way you can see for yourself.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Good luck, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Thanks! After we found that Jewel of Time together, I'm sure this will be no problem.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
How exciting! You really are solving a mystery.
