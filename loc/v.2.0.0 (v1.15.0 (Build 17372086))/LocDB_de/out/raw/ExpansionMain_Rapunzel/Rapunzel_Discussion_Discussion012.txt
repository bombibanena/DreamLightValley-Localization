My hair? Well, it's not so hard. I brush it for a few hours every day.

Or I used to... Now that I know how to braid it, it's not nearly as much work.

So you have way more free time!

Do you miss brushing it so much?

How much hair do you have?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Yes! I do like to weave fresh flowers into it â and that takes time.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
But at least that's always fun!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
No. Not really. I use that time for other things that make me happy, like painting.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
And I do still brush it a lot, just not every day for hours.

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Oh, I'm not sure...

Mother stopped measuring after 50 feet... and that was years ago.
