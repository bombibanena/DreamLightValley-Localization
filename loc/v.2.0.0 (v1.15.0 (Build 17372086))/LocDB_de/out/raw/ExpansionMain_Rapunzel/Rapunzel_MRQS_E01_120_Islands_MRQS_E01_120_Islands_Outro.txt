I just found this diary entry that mentions Mother Gothel. I think she was here.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
She must still be here! I just heard her laughing! Do you think she's close by?

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I can feel a LOT of magic in this place. I don't think that was Mother Gothel.

TAG: Rapunzel_032_f
Maybe some sort of... echo of her? Like she WAS here a long time ago.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Oh...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Something on your mind?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You seem frightened...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Don't worry; I can protect you!

TAG: Rapunzel_021_f
I've been thinking a lot since I last saw Mother.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Mother Gothel took the Jewel of Time!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We've hit a dead end.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eternity Isle is doomed!

TAG: Rapunzel_022_f
I don't know what I'll say to her when I see her again.

TAG: Rapunzel_023_f
Because she lied to you?

TAG: Rapunzel_024_f
Yes.

TAG: Rapunzel_033_f
You know it's okay to be upset with her, right?

TAG: Rapunzel_026_f
I know â I just â I want to focus on our missing things, if that's all right?

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Okay, but it seems like we should talk about it sooner or later...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
For now, let's review: We have a diary page that says Mother Gothel wanted the Jewel of Time, there was an echo of her voice, AND the Jewel of Time is missing from its statue.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
You don't think...

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Huh... Now that I think about it, she is very interested in magic and time...

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Mother has a chest of special belongings in the tower for safekeeping. She made me promise never to look inside.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
That must be where the Jewel of Time is hidden. All the clues line up!

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
But do you really think she'dâ

TAG: Rapunzel_000_f
We have to check the tower, Rapunzel. Eternity Isle is counting on us. Let's go!

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Okay... I'll meet you there.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Maybe, but... maybe not?

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
You don't mean that!

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
This place was our last chance to find the Jewel of Time. Without it, there will be big trouble.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Well... There is one place you haven't looked...

TAG: Rapunzel_030_f
I'm not afraid. I've learned so much since I last saw Mother.

TAG: Rapunzel_031_f
That's really kind of you, but I've learned that I can protect myself.
