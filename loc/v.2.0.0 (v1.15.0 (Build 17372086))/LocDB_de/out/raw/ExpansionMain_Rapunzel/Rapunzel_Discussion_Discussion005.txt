Well, I guess when I lived in the tower I never needed them, so I got used to it.

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Do you ever like to go barefoot?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No, shoes are a fashion essential!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sometimes, in sand or grass.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Never! It's icky and dangerous.

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Huh. I never thought of shoes as a way to express yourself before.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
But I bet it could be fun!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
What kind of shoes should I get to express myself?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Some colorful, artistic shoes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Some comfortable, athletic shoes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You'll know them when you see them!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Ooh, colorful like my paints? What a great idea!

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
That could make running and climbing easier... I'll definitely consider it.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Hmm... I wonder if they make painting, sculpting, climbing, running, cooking, reading, star-charting shoes...

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Yes! I love feeling the earth under my feet. I waited a long time for that.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What about mud?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What are your opinions on puddles?

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
Well, it is a bit squishy and messy, but it comes right off.

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Puddles...?

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
You know, jumping and splashing in puddles?

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
Splashing in puddles? What a GREAT idea!

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Well, it is important to watch where you step.

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
That's why I'm always on the lookout for the dangers Mother warned me about, like poison ivy.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Not to mention gum!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
There's no poison ivy here.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
Mother didn't warn me about gum. What is that? Besides something you clearly don't want to step on.

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
No poison ivy? Are you sure?

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
*sigh* Oh, Mother...
