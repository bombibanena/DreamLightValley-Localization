{PlayerName}, can I talk to you? It's about Mother...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What did she do now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's talk about this later!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Well, this morning she came to the tower... and she asked me to sing for her.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
I don't know how I feel about helping her... now that I know she lied to me again. This time about the Valley. And she hid me away from the Villagers...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Singing for her... Helping her with my magic hair? It feels... strange.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You feel like she's using you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'll tell her to leave you alone.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Let's put a curse on her!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
Yes. I've barely seen her, and then she shows up only when she needs me.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
I don't think that's right.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
What if Mother Gothel didn't need your magic? If you didn't have to sing for her?

TAG: Rapunzel_014_f
Oh. That would be good... I think. Our visits would certainly be different.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm on the case.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Good different?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
What if she stops visiting?

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
Really?! What do you need? How can I help?

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
First things first: Do you know where you got your magic from?

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
No... Mother said it's something I was born with. But she hasn't always been truthful with me. Maybe you could ask her?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Good idea. Don't worry, Rapunzel â whether you were born with your magic or it came from somewhere else, I'll find a way.

TAG: Rapunzel_015_f
I hope so.

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
I suppose that might happen.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
But I'm not alone anymore. I have you and the Village... I don't need someone who only wants to use me.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
No. I don't want to never see her... I just wish I felt like she was visiting me, not my hair.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
What? Oh no! No no, just forget I said anything!

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
It's okay, Rapunzel. I was joking... Mostly.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Oh. Good! Because I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I just wish she'd come to see me... instead of my hair.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Oh! Of course â just... It would be great if we could talk soon, okay?
