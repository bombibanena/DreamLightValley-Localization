Did you have any luck with the search?

TAG: Rapunzel_010_f
Could be! How can I deal with this? The swarm is too thick to get through right now.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
{PlayerName}... have you ever heard about carnivorous plants?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ahh, I see what you're suggesting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can't say I have.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Well, I found this strange-looking pedestal that was just SWARMING with bugs.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Here â I took some pictures.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
Oh, let me see...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
*gasp* That swarm looks like it's all scarabs! It's odd that they're here in the jungle. They normally stay in the desert.

TAG: Rapunzel_009_f
And it's also odd that they're swarming like that. I wonder if the magic of your <Lore>Scarab Key</Lore> has called them here away from the desert.

TAG: Rapunzel_012_f
I knew you would!

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
There are lots of carnivorous plants around here.

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
There's the <Lore>Venus Flytrap</Lore> and the <Lore>Pitcher Plant</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
If you gather enough of them, you could make some <Lore>Carnivorous Flower Arrangements</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Then, if you <Lore>place them by the pedestal</Lore>, I'm sure they'll take care of that scarab swarm!

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
Amazing â thank you, Rapunzel!

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
Well, they're plants that get their food from eating bugs instead of from the soil and sun.
