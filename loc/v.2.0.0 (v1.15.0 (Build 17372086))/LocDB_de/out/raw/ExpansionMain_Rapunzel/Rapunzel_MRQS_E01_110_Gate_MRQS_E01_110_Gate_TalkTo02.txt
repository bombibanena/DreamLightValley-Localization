*gasp* What did you pick up off the ground? It looks like a <ActivityItem>piece of a sphere</ActivityItem>...?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
And it's made of the same golden material as <Lore>that sun in the door</Lore>...

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
Right! I think it's supposed to be the <Lore>core of the sun</Lore>. But it's missing pieces... I bet if we found them and put them together, the door would open for us.

TAG: Rapunzel_013_f
This is so exciting! My paints are behind this door; I just know it!

TAG: Rapunzel_016_f
You really think your paints will be there?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're REALLY looking everywhere for them...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who would hide them here?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Seems a little strange...

TAG: Rapunzel_017_f
I promise. I've looked through this ENTIRE jungle. Painting is very important to me. It helped me pass the time in the tower. It's like it... made my world more beautiful.

TAG: Rapunzel_018_f
I used to see lights on the mainland from my window every night. So I painted them in a mural on my wall.

TAG: Rapunzel_019_f
Those lights had to be from the villagers' houses...

TAG: Rapunzel_020_f
But then Mother got angry. She said I was ungrateful for what I had, took my paints away, and hid them somewhere.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
We'll find your paints AND the Jewel of Time.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Your Mother shouldn't have done that.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Behind this giant ancient magic door?!

TAG: Rapunzel_035_f
I can feel it. We're on the right track.

TAG: Rapunzel_011_f
Oh! Maybe you could <Lore>search for pieces of the Sun Core inside more of the Floating Rocks around the Isle</Lore>.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
I saw some on <Lore>the Plains</Lore> and <Lore>the Docks</Lore> this morning. You could start looking there!

TAG: Rapunzel_034_f
Thank you for saying that, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Rapunzel_037_f
She shouldn't have punished you for being curious about the world outside the tower.

TAG: Rapunzel_039_f
She just doesn't understand.

TAG: Rapunzel_040_f
Don't worry about it too much, okay? Let's just focus on getting this door open first.

TAG: Rapunzel_036_f
Mother is VERY determined. If she wants something, or wants to hide something, she'll always find a way.

TAG: Rapunzel_038_f
We're determined too. Let's get this door open!

TAG: Rapunzel_031_f
... I think it was Mother.

TAG: Rapunzel_032_f
I know, but I can't stop searching now. I HAVE to find them.
