My mirror! You found it!

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
And so quickly. I knew I could count on you.

This mirror is a piece of junk.

What's your scheme, Gothel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What's the big idea?

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Of course it is, darling. Did you really think I would ever drop something of value?

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Oh, don't look so UPSET. You must stop taking everything so seriously. Now, shall I tell you my plan?

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
You see, {PlayerName}, I've always wondered if that Dreamlight Magic of yours might work like Rapunzel's magical hair...

So I "borrowed" a little book from Merlin... Traded for a few potions and ingredients from Ursula...

And now that the magic of the Orb is gone, there's nothing to stop me from throwing it all together to keep you safe in the Giant Willow forever!

It's for your own good, dear. The world outside is far too dangerous. Trust me. It's better this way. You'll see, in time, that I can be a very loving mother.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
My scheme? That makes it sound so... common.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
The big idea? No, dear. It's a brilliant idea!
