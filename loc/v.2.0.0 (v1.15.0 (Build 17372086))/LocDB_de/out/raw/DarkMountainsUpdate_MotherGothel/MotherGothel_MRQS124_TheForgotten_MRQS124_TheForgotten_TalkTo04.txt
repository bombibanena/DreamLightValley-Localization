Here we are. Now, pay attention, dear... These Pillars have been here for as long as anyone in the Village can remember.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
If you asked Merlin, he'd tell you they symbolize the virtues that hold this Village together and protect it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Oh, how that man loves to hear himself talk!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Don't insult Merlin.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess he can be a bit long-winded sometimes...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
What a pity... You still insist on defending Merlin even though he's done nothing but lie to you.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Huh? What do you mean?

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Merlin told you that these Pillars protect the Village. But they don't.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
They only prevent brilliant people like us from reaching our full potential.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Everything he's told you about light and Dark Magic... friendship, trust, and so on... nothing more than lies to keep you under his control.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I don't believe you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I... I know that you must be right...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What should I do now...?

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Well, there's one way to find out for sure.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
<Lore>Rip the Orb out of the Pillar</Lore>. Then you'll see that what I'm saying is true.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
It's time to find out what you're truly capable of.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Worse than that. Merlin is a liar.
