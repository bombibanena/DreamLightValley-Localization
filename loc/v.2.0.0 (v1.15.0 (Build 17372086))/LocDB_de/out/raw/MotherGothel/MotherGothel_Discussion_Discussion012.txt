Ah, {PlayerName}... It's occurred to me that only you and I have the interests of this Valley at heart; don't you agree?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What makes you think that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think everyone cares for the Valley in their own way.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Finally, someone who listens to me!

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
They're all living in their grand Houses, only caring for themselves and their personal whims. Unlike me. Why, I've truly dedicated myself to tending to the Giant Willow.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I love the Giant Willow!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why do you look after it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You can always stop, you know...

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Then maybe YOU ought to live in it! Ha-ha! Only kidding, dear. Don't look so serious.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
After all, I was the one who helped you grow that Giant Willow in the first place, you know.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
And that is proof that only you and I care about what's best for our Valley.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Because someone needs to! Plants are like children. They require constant care if you don't want them to grow up spoiled.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
I was the one who helped you make sure the tree would grow strong and tall. So... of course, I stayed to watch over it.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Then there would be no one to care for the willow I helped you grow. No, {PlayerName}. I must stay where I am.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Well, just look around...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Perhaps, but how many of them have proof to support their claims? Few or none, I'm sure.
