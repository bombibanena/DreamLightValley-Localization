Ursula, dear, do you have a favorite love potion recipe?

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
I've got a whole shelf of them! I can barely keep them in stock.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Good to know. Not that I need one for myself, of course. But if I'd like one for a friend...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Oh, I'll help you... for a price. I'd love to see how my marine potions work on humans!

I hadn't considered that particular... wrinkle. I'll just have to choose my "friend" carefully.
