What did it say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
I have no time for this.

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
Tragically, it doesn't have all the answers I hoped.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
It merely points toward the next step in finding the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem> and restoring the Giant Willow.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
It goes on and on about power and magic, blah-blah-blah, but then it says that the remaining clues lie in a cave in the Valley...

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
And only the fire from an item called the <ActivityItem>Sunlight Torch</ActivityItem> can reveal them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Making torches sounds easy enough.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
Is there anything special about them?

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
You better hope I don't get a splinter...

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
I didn't want to confuse you with something too complicated, dear. Now...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
We must have three of them. One for each milestone of the day: dawn, midday and sunset.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
You'll need some <ActivityItem>Magic Sap</ActivityItem> to act as a combustible, but I've already gotten that for you...

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
And don't worry your cute little head about the recipe. I have it right here.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
You'll also need to find some gemstones: <ActivityItem>Citrines</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Aquamarines</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Garnets</ActivityItem> to symbolize the milestones of the day.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
Once you have all that, craft the <ActivityItem>Sunlight Torches</ActivityItem> and come straight back to me... Now shoo!

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Oh, please! I can't always be there to hold your hand. Besides, they're only torches.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
Pity. Particularly since you have so few qualities beyond being helpful.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Oh, I'm just teasing! Don't be so serious.
