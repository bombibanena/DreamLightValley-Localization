How about next time, we bury YOU?

While you were gone, I restored the <ActivityItem>Noon Fragment</ActivityItem>. It was arduous work leaving it on the window sill under the midday sun.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
And now that the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem> are together, it's time to attempt the spell...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
"<ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem> reunited, glow for all to see..."

"Call the <ActivityItem>Sun Meteorites</ActivityItem>. Let them come to me!"

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
All my grueling labor has come to fruition! There will be many <ActivityItem>Sun Meteorites</ActivityItem> to gather.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Most of them have fallen over the Forgotten Lands. Hurry! Gather them quickly!
