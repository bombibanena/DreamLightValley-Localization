Oh! I didn't recognize you. You look positively dreadful...

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Ha! I'm only teasing, dear! Now, tell me what you need.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I need information about the curse.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Just wanted the pleasure of your company.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Would you help the Village?

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Well, I might be able to help... for a favor. Without Rapunzel's magic, I'm not as spry as I should be. You wouldn't leave a poor woman in distress, would you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Helping you is the right thing to do.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The information better be worth it!

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Oh, your parents would be so proud. Now, bring me some food, and I'll give you a bit of information.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Simple enough, yes? But not just any food.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
The other day, I saw someone at the Restaurant in the Village eating a scrumptious-looking dish.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Fish rolled up in rice. Quite a clever idea, really.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
It's called a <ActivityItem>Sushi</ActivityItem> roll.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Must've been a kind of <ActivityItem>Sushi</ActivityItem> roll.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Oh, I like that! I wonder... is the <ActivityItem>Lobster Roll</ActivityItem> the little rat made me called sushi too?

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Actually, I'd love another one of those as well!

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Now, if I remember correctly, the <ActivityItem>Lobster Roll</ActivityItem> was made from <ActivityItem>Lobster</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Lemon</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Butter</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Garlic</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Be a dear and bring me <ActivityItem>Sushi</ActivityItem> and a <ActivityItem>Lobster Roll</ActivityItem>. Oh, and make sure they're fresh. I despise anything but the freshest fish.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
I promise you, it is. Now, bring me some food, and I'll give you a bit of information.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Did no one teach you not to lie? I know you're conspiring with the Sea Witch. She wants information about the curse, doesn't she?

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Well, I want something too. Get it for me and I'll tell you all you need to know.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Don't you mean help the Sea Witch? I know she's curious about the curse, and I heard she's fond of deals. Let's make one for ourselves.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Bring me what I want, and I'll tell you everything I know.
