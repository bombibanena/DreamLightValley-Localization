{PlayerName}! And to what do I owe the pleasure of your company today?

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
So we have this lion who lives on the Sunlit Plateau andâ

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
Let me guess! You want to get rid of him before he hunts and eats someone. I have just the thing.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
Uh... no. I'm trying to convince Scar to talk to me, but he won't unless my "coat" looks a little more worthy of a ruler...

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
I was hoping you could help me with that.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Possibly. But why would you allow this... beast to stay in the Village?

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
My dear, the quickest solution would be to turn this foolish feline INTO a coat.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Mother Gothel! That's awful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I can't. Scar might be useful to me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Sorry, but I only wear plant-based fabrics.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Awful? Debatable. Practical? Most definitely.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
*sigh* But if you insist on doing it your way and want me to help you make a coat, bring me the materials, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
I'll need <ActivityItem>Fiber</ActivityItem>, pieces of <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem>, a pair of <ActivityItem>Citrines</ActivityItem> and an <ActivityItem>Iron Ingot</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
<ActivityItem>Citrines</ActivityItem>? For a coat? Why do you want me to find gemstones?

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
To teach you not to ask stupid questions!

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
Oh, I'm just joking.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
You should really learn to smile more, {PlayerName}. You're always so gloomy.

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
Now, run along, and don't come back until you've fetched everything I've asked for.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Hmm... Keeping Scar around to manipulate him to your own ends? I can't say that I disapprove...

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Now, if you want me to help you make a coat, you'll have to bring me the materials.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Of course you do, dear.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Well, if you want me to help you make a coat, you'll have to bring me the materials.
