Do you see that floating island over there? That's where I tossed the <ActivityItem>Orb of Trust</ActivityItem>.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
You can try to get it back. But only if you know how to sprout wings...

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
The bridge to that island broke long ago.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
And one more word of warning about the <ActivityItem>Orb of Trust</ActivityItem>. You might be able to see it, but you won't be able to touch it.

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
I cast a spell to try to hide it. But it worked a bit too well. It's between worlds now. Like a dream, when you're on the verge of waking...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What do you suggest?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Can't you do something about it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I've never seen this before.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
The same thing happened to Minnie.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Go ask Merlin. He's always blathering on about his research. He might know something.

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
If I could, I'd already have done so. Try Merlin. Let the old coot do something useful for once.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Nor I, dear. I'm afraid we'll have to resort to desperate measures. Such as asking that fool Merlin for help...

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
And you managed to get her back? Fascinating. I suppose that tedious Merlin had something to do with it.

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
You might as well go ask for his advice... Well, what are you still doing here? Go!
