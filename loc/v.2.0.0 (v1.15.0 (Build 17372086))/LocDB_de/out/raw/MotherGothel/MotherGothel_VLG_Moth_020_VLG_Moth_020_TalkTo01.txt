Oh, I knew my favorite little helper would have my <ActivityItem>Sunlight Torches</ActivityItem> in... almost no time.

Now, someone who can use Dreamlight Magic must go to the bottom of the Mystical Cave...

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
There, you'll find the Pedestal of the Sun. Place the <ActivityItem>Sunlight Torches</ActivityItem> on it.

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
Then... something will happen. I'm sure it won't be dangerous... to me! Ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Sounds easy enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
What's going to happen?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Am I going to get cursed or something?

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Oh, I'm so happy to hear you say that.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
No matter what happens, I want to know. Bring me evidence of whatever you find down there.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
The <ActivityItem>Scroll</ActivityItem> isn't clear on that point but...

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
No...

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Perhaps?

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
I'm sure you're up to the task, dear.
