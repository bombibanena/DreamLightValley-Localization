Hey, Kristoff. Ursula's looking for backup singers for a big performance, and I thought you'd be great! Would you want to help out?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Your voice is dreamy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Your voice is like a warm hug!

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Maybe you could play your lute too!

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Wow. Of all the things I thought you might ask... that definitely wasn't one of them.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
It's okay if you're not feeling up to it.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
No, if you'd like me to, I'm happy to help.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Ursula wanted me to have you audition...

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Oh. Well, I guess I can just play a song for you.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
There. Was that okay?

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Aw, thanks!

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Congratulations! Can't wait to see you perform!
