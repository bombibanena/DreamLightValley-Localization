I hear you and Donald have been having some... misunderstandings.

TAG: Stitch_001_f
No misunderstanding. Stitch do prank, Donald go "WAAAAKKKK!" Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

TAG: Stitch_002_f
Donald is my funny friend.

TAG: Player_000_f
Friends? You're pranking Donald because you think it's funny when he's mad?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Some people don't like to be pranked, Stitch.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Donald gets mad easily enough without being pranked.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Heh. That is pretty funny.

TAG: Stitch_003_f
Donald's getting really upset. You have to respect his boundaries.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
... Oh. You want me to stop pranking Donald?

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Is Stitch's badness level too high?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Don't worry. We'll get it under control.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Of course not. You're just a little rambunctious.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm afraid we're reaching critical levels of badness.

TAG: Stitch_009_f
Stitch will do better. Promise.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Why don't we start by replacing those signs you drew on?

TAG: Stitch_012_f
I'll teach you to repair stuff. Let's go <Lore>fix Donald's signs</Lore>. We'll need to find <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, and those <ActivityItem>Vandalized Signs</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Stitch_005_f
Let's not make the situation worse.

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Yeah, {PlayerName} knows funny. It's good.

TAG: Stitch_007_f
But I think we've had enough fun around here for a little while. Donald's getting really upset.
