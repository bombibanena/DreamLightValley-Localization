You again?

TAG: Stitch_001_f
Grr! Feeboogoo!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I wanted to apologize.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I built you a little something.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You need to stop messing with other Villagers.

TAG: Stitch_002_f
We didn't mean to wreck your spaceship.

TAG: Stitch_015_f
Stitch go in ship to get help. For everyone!

TAG: Stitch_024_f
But I need fuel.

TAG: Stitch_025_f
So I come back, find things to put in ship so ship go faster.

TAG: Stitch_026_f
What sorts of things did you put in your ship...?

TAG: Stitch_027_f
Lots of stuff! Socks, books...

TAG: Stitch_028_f
Night Thorns...

TAG: Stitch_029_f
You tried to use Night Thorns as fuel?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Did it work?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No wonder the navigation was messed up.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm surprised you didn't crash sooner.

TAG: Stitch_003_f
To make up for it, we built a special place in the Village, just for you.

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Special place?

TAG: Stitch_009_f
Special place, like... home?

TAG: Stitch_010_f
Exactly.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Ohh. Stitch wants to have a home.

TAG: Stitch_012_f
I'm {PlayerName}. You probably don't remember this place because of...

TAG: Stitch_013_f
...the Forgetting.

TAG: Stitch_014_f
Sky get dark and bad Night Thorns grow.

TAG: Stitch_031_f
No. Not good.

TAG: Stitch_030_f
Hagada!

TAG: Stitch_023_f
And then Night Thorns make my head not good.

TAG: Stitch_016_f
So I got... lo-lo-lost.

TAG: Stitch_017_f
Well, you're not lost anymore, Stitch.

TAG: Stitch_018_f
{PlayerName}... achi-baba?

TAG: Stitch_019_f
Are you my friend?

TAG: Stitch_020_f
We're all friends here. Welcome back to Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Stitch_021_f
Just... promise you'll give back all those socks you took, okay?

TAG: Stitch_022_f
Yeah. Yeah. Promise.

TAG: Stitch_032_f
Yeah, ship controls not good.

TAG: Stitch_033_f
Almost crash a lot.

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Huh? You build something for Stitch? Is it a new spaceship?

TAG: Stitch_005_f
It's something a little more permanent. A special place for you in the Village.

TAG: Stitch_007_f
I know you mean well. But we can't have anything going missing or houses getting messed up.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
So we built a house just for you, where you can do whatever you want. Your own special place.
