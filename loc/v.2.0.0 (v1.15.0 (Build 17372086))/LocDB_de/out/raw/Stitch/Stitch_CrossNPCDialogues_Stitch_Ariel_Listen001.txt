Hi, Ariel! {PlayerName} tell Stitch you are mermaid who change shape.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Oh, it was just awful. I love to sing so much.

TAG: Stitch_014_f
But when Ursula had my voice, I couldn't sing a single note.

TAG: Stitch_012_f
But don't worry. I have it back... *giggle* Which I guess you can tell, since I'm talking to you.

TAG: Stitch_013_f
Phewf. Daki-dah!

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Stitch, it's so nice to see you!

TAG: Stitch_005_f
Oh, you are nice sea... person? Not like Ursula. She mean.

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Yes, you should be careful around Ursula.

TAG: Stitch_007_f
She likes to trick people, so she can get what she wants.

TAG: Stitch_003_f
She tricked me once and stole my voice!

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Stole voice? You couldn't talk?

TAG: Stitch_009_f
I couldn't talk, couldn't sing...

TAG: Stitch_010_f
Couldn't sing?!

TAG: Stitch_002_f
Hi, Ariel! Are you mermaid?
