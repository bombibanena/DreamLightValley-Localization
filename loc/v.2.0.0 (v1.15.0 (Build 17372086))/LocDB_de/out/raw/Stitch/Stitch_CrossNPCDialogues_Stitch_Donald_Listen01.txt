WAK! Not you again!

TAG: Stitch_004_f
What kind of trick are you gonna pull on me this time?

TAG: Stitch_005_f
No trick. Just say sorry.

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Sorry...?

TAG: Stitch_007_f
Now I know you're pullin' a prank. I'm too smart to fall for it.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
No! No! No trick!

TAG: Stitch_009_f
{PlayerName} help Stitch fix signs and help Stitch say sorry.

TAG: Stitch_010_f
...I'm sorry.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
From Stitch's heart bottom! Just like {PlayerName} say.

TAG: Stitch_014_f
Well, if this really isn't a trick...

TAG: Stitch_015_f
Then... aww, I guess I forgive you. For now.

TAG: Stitch_016_f
But I'll be keeping an eye on you, and you better not try anything again!

TAG: Stitch_012_f
And Stitch promise never to do it again so never have to say sorry again, just like {PlayerName} say!

TAG: Stitch_013_f
Now it's over. Just like {PlayerName} say.
