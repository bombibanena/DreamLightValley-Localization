Well? What do you think?

TAG: Stitch_001_f
Ooh. Nice cave. Lots of shiny things.

TAG: Stitch_002_f
But where is sea monster?

TAG: Stitch_003_f
Adventure not good if no sea monster.

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Stitch wants big purple sea monster with tentacles!

TAG: Stitch_005_f
Hm. The closest thing we have to what you're describing in this Village is Ursula, I guess.

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Ursula. Ooh. Yeah! Yeah! We <Lore>visit Ursula</Lore>?

TAG: Player_000_f
We'll visit Ursula, but just be sure...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...not to make any deals with her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...to stay on your best behavior.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...to not call her a monster.

TAG: Stitch_007_f
The last thing we need is her making you part of her garden.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Stitch be good. Make friends with Ursula. Go! Go! Go!
