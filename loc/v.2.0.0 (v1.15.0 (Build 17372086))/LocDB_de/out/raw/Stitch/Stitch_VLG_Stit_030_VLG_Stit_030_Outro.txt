Stitch is glad Ariel's okay.

If I lose voice, I would be very sad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Me too. I wouldn't be able to sing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd be scared. I couldn't ask for help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
At least you wouldn't have to make small talk.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't sing.

TAG: Stitch_012_f
Yeah! Yeah! Stitch want to sing!

TAG: Stitch_003_f
Wait a sec... you like making music!

TAG: Stitch_005_f
That's perfect! I should have thought of this before.

TAG: Stitch_007_f
Music can be your hobby. You can put on a show and play for the whole Village.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Oooooh... Stitch like that idea!

TAG: Stitch_009_f
Go practice songs now for show.

TAG: Stitch_010_f
Then, Stitch be model citizen!

TAG: Stitch_013_f
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't go ask Merlin to help me with something.

TAG: Stitch_014_f
Yeah. Not good. No talking and no singing.

TAG: Stitch_015_f
Stitch wants to sing!

TAG: Stitch_016_f
No more awkward chit-chat about the weather... might not be so bad!

TAG: Stitch_017_f
But no talking and no singing.
