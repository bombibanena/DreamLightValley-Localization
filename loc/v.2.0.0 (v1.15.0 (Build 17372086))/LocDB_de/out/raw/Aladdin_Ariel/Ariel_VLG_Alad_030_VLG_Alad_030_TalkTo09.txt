Hey, Ariel... Aladdin and I came across a bunch of pieces of an old pillar out on the island where I found you.

I took this photo. You didn't see any other pieces like these while you were out there, did you?

TAG: Ariel_002_f
You know... I did NOTICE those out there, but I never knew what to do with them.

Oh! But I just got some really nice sea glass for my collection by that island. I'll show you sometime!
