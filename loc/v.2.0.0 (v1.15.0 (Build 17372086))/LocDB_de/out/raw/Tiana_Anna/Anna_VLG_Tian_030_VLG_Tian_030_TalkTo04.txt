That's amazing! It smells wonderful.

TAG: Anna_001_f
I know, right? It almost sent my head spinning when I took a sniff.

TAG: Anna_002_f
Which spices did you use?

TAG: Anna_004_f
All of them!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No wonder the scent is strong enough to pick me up!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Umm... was that part of the recipe?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh, am I going to need to gather replacement spices for Tiana now?

TAG: Anna_013_f
If some of the spices make it good, then more of the spices will make it great, right?

TAG: Anna_007_f
Huh, well it still tasted pretty good for having every single spice in it.

TAG: Anna_008_f
YES! I'm so glad you liked it!

TAG: Anna_009_f
Well, I think I need to consider the best dish now...

TAG: Anna_010_f
While you do that, I'll ask Tiana to teach me about New Orleans sandwiches.

TAG: Anna_011_f
She said there are some special ones that are famous there.

TAG: Anna_012_f
That's a great idea. Thanks for sharing your dish, Anna.

TAG: Anna_006_f
No. But they all seemed so delicious that I couldn't decide, so I put them all in.

TAG: Anna_014_f
No, don't worry. I used every spice, but not all of each spice.
