You've done it. Bravo!

TAG: Scar_002_f
Now, just give that pesky thing to me.

TAG: Scar_003_f
The Orb of Nurturing...? What would you want with that?

TAG: Scar_004_f
Oh, only for safekeeping, of course. I may not understand exactly what it is... but I know something powerful and dangerous when I see it.

<Forgotten>(He IS tricking me. He's tricking me just like Mother Gothel did.)</Forgotten>

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
YOU...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
CAN'T...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
TRICK ME!

TAG: Scar_007_f
I know exactly what you're trying to do! And I'm not gonna fall for it!

TAG: Scar_008_f
Oh dear. Temper, {PlayerName}. Can't you see that you've already done exactly what I wanted?

TAG: Scar_009_f
Look at everything you've broken.

TAG: Scar_010_f
The other Villagers will never forgive you for this.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What have I done...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're wrong.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
AGGGHHHH!!!

TAG: Scar_011_f
Oh, there's no point in worrying.

TAG: Scar_014_f
I can easily fix this for you. Simply let ME rule Dreamlight Valley. It will be an immense burden, but I'm prepared to make the sacrifice.

TAG: Scar_015_f
Besides, it's really your only choice. Make me king and stand at my side...

TAG: Scar_016_f
...or run away and never return.

TAG: Scar_017_f
...

TAG: Scar_018_f
You'll never be king, Scar. I'll make sure of that.

TAG: Scar_000_f
AHH! You ingrate! After all I've done for you.

TAG: Scar_006_f
If you come to your senses, I'll be in my cave!

TAG: Scar_012_f
Am I? You can only fool yourself for so long. You must see how the Villagers are ignoring you more and more. How it seems like they're looking right through you?

TAG: Scar_013_f
Oh, do try to keep your emotions in check, {PlayerName}. You've no need to fear.
