Hey there... Timon and I need your help with something.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Have you noticed purple bugs everywhere?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you busy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
By the way, should we keep calling you "the Forgotten"?

TAG: TheForgotten_006_f
I did... But there's always something happening here. I wasn't sure if it was good strange or bad strange.

TAG: TheForgotten_000_f
The bugs are called Night Mites, and they're connected to the Night Thorns somehow.

TAG: TheForgotten_014_f
Timon and I found a nest, but my Dreamlight Magic can't remove it. Do you have any advice?

TAG: TheForgotten_015_f
Sounds like you need something to boost your power.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Sounds like you've got something in mind.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Some sort of protein shake?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Can you give me a pep talk?

TAG: TheForgotten_017_f
Heh. Did you read my mind...?

TAG: TheForgotten_019_f
Before I tried to take over â well... you know. I was trying to improve my power. I made a tonic to try and amplify it.

TAG: TheForgotten_020_f
I think if you swap a few ingredients, it should give you what you need to remove the nests. I'll give you the formula.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Anything else?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Thank you. You're the best!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
You SURE you don't want a makeover sometime?

TAG: TheForgotten_024_f
The bugs may have seen you coming and raised their defenses... So... You could dress like a giant bug.

TAG: TheForgotten_026_f
Um... Okay?!

TAG: TheForgotten_023_f
Don't thank me yet. There's one last thing...

TAG: TheForgotten_025_f
I feel like... This is who I am, for now. But speaking of makeovers...

TAG: TheForgotten_016_f
Not exactly...

TAG: TheForgotten_018_f
You, um... You'll do great. You always do.

TAG: TheForgotten_005_f
No. I finished revising my latest poem for my dark poetry circle.

TAG: TheForgotten_012_f
What do you need?

TAG: TheForgotten_013_f
There are bugs called Night Mites all over the Valley, and they're connected to the Night Thorns somehow.

TAG: TheForgotten_007_f
Maybe we could call you something else?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Something simple like "Bob" or "Jill"?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Something dark like "Raven" or "Shadow"?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
... ANYTHING else?

TAG: TheForgotten_009_f
I don't think those really suit me.

TAG: TheForgotten_011_f
I'm okay with being the Forgotten for now.

TAG: TheForgotten_008_f
Those options actually are pretty cool...

TAG: TheForgotten_010_f
Not really.
