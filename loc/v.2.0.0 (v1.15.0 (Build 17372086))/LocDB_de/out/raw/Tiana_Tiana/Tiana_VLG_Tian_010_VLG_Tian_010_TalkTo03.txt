Okay, we've got some folks invited for the grand opening!

TAG: Tiana_003_f
But, umm... things are looking a little intense here.

TAG: Tiana_004_f
I guess I got a little carried away with my recipe testing.

TAG: Tiana_005_f
I still have some recipes to finish, but I'm starting to run out of clean dishes. And with everything that's cooking, I haven't had time to clean as I go.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Time to craft more dishes, stat!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Any chef snacks you can pass along?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do you need that many recipes?

TAG: Tiana_000_f
Oh, thank you, but I think if I get any more I'll end up buried in dirty dishes.

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Back in New Orleans, I had a full restaurant staff to help out, but now I don't even have a dishwashing counter.

TAG: Tiana_009_f
What if you go talk to Merlin? He has a history of using magic to help with chores. I bet he could help out here.

TAG: Tiana_008_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, what a great idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Do you need a sword too?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe Merlin has more magical ingredients too!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Would a walking sugar bowl be of any help?

TAG: Tiana_019_f
*laugh* Not today. I think I'm just fine with my chef's knife.

TAG: Tiana_011_f
Oh, actually I do need to start on the outdoor seating.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
Think you could <Lore>make some furnishings for me</Lore>?

TAG: Tiana_013_f
Sure! What do you need?

TAG: Tiana_014_f
To start, I'll need some <ActivityItem>Bistro Tables and Chairs</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Tiana_015_f
Once you have them ready, could you <Lore>place them near the Stall</Lore>?

TAG: Tiana_016_f
Sure! How about I aim for <Lore>fun</Lore> with the decorations?

TAG: Tiana_017_f
That would be perfect! You're a lifesaver, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Tiana_020_f
Now that's a thought. I'll keep it in mind for later.

TAG: Tiana_021_f
Unless the bowl has thumbs, it might make things more difficult...

TAG: Tiana_001_f
I wish I did, but nothing's quite ready yet.

TAG: Tiana_018_f
Well, I want to be sure I have a variety of dishes for folks with different tastes.
