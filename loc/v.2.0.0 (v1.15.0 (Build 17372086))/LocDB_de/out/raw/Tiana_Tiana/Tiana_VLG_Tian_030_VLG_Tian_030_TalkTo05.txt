Ready to pick a winner?

TAG: Tiana_005_f
I think so!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Each of the dishes were tasty and interesting, but if I had to pick one that stood out...

TAG: Player_000_f
I'd pick...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...Anna's Fish Creole!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...Mike's okra soup!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...Kristoff's Beignets!

TAG: Tiana_001_f
All right. Tell me what stood out to you about that dish?

TAG: Tiana_009_f
Anna may have gone overboard with the spices.

TAG: Tiana_010_f
But I was surprised at how well-balanced the final dish was. And her fish was cooked perfectly.

TAG: Tiana_004_f
That's what makes cooking so fun! I was surprised at the final flavor of each dish, too.

TAG: Tiana_015_f
Sometimes you take chances and it all works out. Why don't you go tell the winner now?

TAG: Tiana_016_f
Oh, and here's the <ActivityItem>Sandwich Board</ActivityItem> with Anna's winning dish on it.

TAG: Tiana_017_f
Sure! I'll <Lore>put the board in front of your restaurant</Lore> once I've <Lore>spoken with the winner</Lore>.

TAG: Tiana_021_f
Oh, and here's the <ActivityItem>Sandwich Board</ActivityItem> with Mike's winning dish on it.

TAG: Tiana_022_f
Oh, and here's the <ActivityItem>Sandwich Board</ActivityItem> with Kristoff's winning dish on it.

TAG: Tiana_002_f
Interesting. Tell me what you liked about <ActivityItem>Mike's Okra Soup</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Mike went a little rogue with the recipe...

TAG: Tiana_008_f
...but it still tastes surprisingly good!

TAG: Tiana_003_f
What was special to you about <ActivityItem>Kristoff's Beignets</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Tiana_011_f
Kristoff's interest in cold foods was clear.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
But I think he just invented a Cajun Baked Alaska?

TAG: Tiana_013_f
A... Baked Louisiana?

TAG: Tiana_014_f
Haha, exactly!
