Today's the day, {PlayerName}! And I have everything ready!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ooo, what do you have ready?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Definitely got to come see you later!

TAG: Tiana_002_f
Just a little something I've been working on for a while.

TAG: Tiana_003_f
Are you ready?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No, but tell me anyway!

TAG: Tiana_004_f
I'm going to bring something new to the Valley â a long-held New Orleans tradition.

TAG: Tiana_005_f
We're going to have ourselves a Mardi Gras parade!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
A what?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
So. COOL.

TAG: Tiana_006_f
A Mardi Gras parade! In New Orleans, we celebrate a special holiday called Mardi Gras every year.

TAG: Tiana_014_f
On my way!

TAG: Tiana_007_f
And one of the best parts of Mardi Gras is dressing up in special costumes and watching a parade or, better yet, being in one.

TAG: Tiana_008_f
So I want to do the Dreamlight Valley version. That way I can share some of my hometown traditions and let folks bring their own spark to it too.

TAG: Tiana_009_f
That sounds so fun!

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Now usually, a parade has lots of floats, but I'm not sure that would work here.

TAG: Tiana_011_f
So instead... I thought Daisy could help us by making a fancy <ActivityItem>Parade Float Mask</ActivityItem> for you to wear. Since you'll be the leader.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
Great idea! ... I'll do my best as a parade leader.

TAG: Tiana_013_f
I know you will! Why don't you <Lore>go see Daisy and talk fashion</Lore>? I'm sure she'll have some swell ideas for what else you can wear.

TAG: Tiana_001_f
While you do that, I have some secret items of my own to get together...
