Why, he's just peachy keen! In fact, he's learning to cook.

How's that going?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds like a potential disaster.

He cooks in the restaurant?

TAG: Tiana_000_f
Well, considering he couldn't even mince a mushroom when I first met him, I'd say he's doing well.

He's even introduced me to some delicious dishes from Maldonia!

I'm not saying there haven't been some messes, but he's a quick learner.

TAG: Tiana_003_f
I just love how he doesn't let any mistakes get under his skin.

TAG: Tiana_004_f
He just tosses away whatever's burnt or spilled and starts right over!

TAG: Tiana_005_f
Oh no, he's out front with me and the customers or on stage playing with Louis and the band.

But we cook together at home. It's one of our favorite ways to spend time with each other.
