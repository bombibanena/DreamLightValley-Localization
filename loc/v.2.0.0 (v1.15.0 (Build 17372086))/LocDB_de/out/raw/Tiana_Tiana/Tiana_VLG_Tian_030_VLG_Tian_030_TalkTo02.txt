Okay Tiana, I've got your contestants!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh, no problem â what's up?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do I get paid in Cajun food?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Anything for you two!

TAG: Tiana_001_f
Wonderful! Chef Remy's here too.

TAG: Tiana_016_f
Cool! Hey, Remy!

TAG: Tiana_002_f
I'm just here to help out and maybe get some tips on Cajun cooking. But Kristoff, Anna, and Mike are ready!

TAG: Tiana_004_f
I can see that! You've got herbs, a bunch of veggies...

TAG: Tiana_005_f
What's the first round of the contest going to be?

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Well, we're going to start with some basic skills â washing herbs and the difference between chopping and mincing.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Cool! Well, I'll leave you to itâ

TAG: Tiana_008_f
Hold up, {PlayerName}; we need a hand with something else.

TAG: Tiana_025_f
We thought it might help if you did the demonstrations for our contestants.

TAG: Tiana_026_f
That way Remy and I can be by their sides guiding them as they try things.

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Me? But I'm not a professional chef.

TAG: Tiana_011_f
Maybe not. But we've all seen you cooking up a storm almost every day!

TAG: Tiana_012_f
I guess...

TAG: Tiana_013_f
Marvelous! Let's begin...

TAG: Tiana_015_f
To start, could you <Lore>demonstrate handling herbs by washing them</Lore>? That way they'll see how clean we want the herbs to be.

TAG: Tiana_022_f
Then, <Lore>chop the corn and potatoes into bite-sized pieces</Lore>. That'll show our contestants how to get everything the same size and the right size so it cooks properly.

TAG: Tiana_023_f
Sure! What are you making?

TAG: Tiana_024_f
It's a <ActivityItem>Seafood Boil</ActivityItem> â a classic New Orleans dish.

TAG: Tiana_019_f
So we'll need some extra fresh seafood too. Would you catch us some <ActivityItem>Shrimp</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Crab</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Lobster</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Tiana_020_f
When all the Ingredients are ready, please bring them to me and I'll take care of the next steps.

TAG: Tiana_021_f
Sounds delicious! On it!

TAG: Tiana_027_f
Actually, you will later on in the contest!
