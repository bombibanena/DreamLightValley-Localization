Why, thank you! My mama designed it special for the opening of my restaurant.

Do you like dressing up?

Does your mother make all your clothes?

You know Minnie Mouse is a seamstress, too.

TAG: Tiana_000_f
I do! Not all the time, mind you, but certainly on special occasions.

My best friend Charlotte, though?

She'd wear a new ball gown every day if she could!

TAG: Tiana_003_f
She did for a long time. And that always made me feel so loved.

Now, Mama's so busy designing for others that I buy most of my everyday clothes.

TAG: Tiana_005_f
But anytime I need a special dress, she's the only one I go to!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
That's right! She makes some wonderful clothes.

I sure would love her and Mama to meet.
