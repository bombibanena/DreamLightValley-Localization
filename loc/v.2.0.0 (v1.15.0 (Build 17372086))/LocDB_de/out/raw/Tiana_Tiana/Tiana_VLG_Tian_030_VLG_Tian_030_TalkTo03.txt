So, how did you like the Seafood Boil? Each cook contributed something to the flavors.

TAG: Tiana_001_f
It was really tasty! Let me see if I can identify each Villager's contribution.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think Mike is responsible for...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think Anna is responsible for...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think Kristoff is responsible for...

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Actually, I trust your judgment here.

TAG: Tiana_002_f
...the weird punch I tasted with some of the veggies.

TAG: Tiana_003_f
Weird, but... good? Like, it's a sourness that makes all the other flavors pop.

TAG: Tiana_004_f
I noticed that too! It tastes like fermentation to me, but how did he ferment things so quickly?!

TAG: Tiana_005_f
I think that's just Mike's special skill!

TAG: Tiana_013_f
So, overall, that was really tasty!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Whoa, never seen that before!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Really? I thought chalk was made from rocks.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Well, that'll be a fun craft!

TAG: Tiana_014_f
But I could see how they're all still a little new to this.

TAG: Tiana_015_f
Compared to the food I've tried at your Stall, they aren't there just yet...

TAG: Tiana_016_f
With a few more lessons, they will be.

TAG: Tiana_017_f
The next step is for them to make their own individual meals. Then we'll be able to pick the winner.

TAG: Tiana_018_f
Cool! What does the winner get?

TAG: Tiana_019_f
I'll advertise their dish at my Stall!

TAG: Tiana_020_f
But for that, I'll need some help. Could you build me a <ActivityItem>Sandwich Board</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Tiana_021_f
And we'll need chalk too. You can make some from scratch with <Lore>eggshells and flour</Lore>.

TAG: Tiana_023_f
Well, since we're having a culinary contest, I thought it would be fun to try and make some of the non-food items from food too!

TAG: Tiana_022_f
I'll be back in a flash!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
...the way the potatoes were prepared.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
They're all cut into flat planks. But why?

TAG: Tiana_008_f
Well, Anna mentioned that she wanted folks to be able to make sandwiches out of the Seafood Boil, using potato planks.

TAG: Tiana_009_f
Strange, given that the potatoes are still boiled, but an interesting attempt!

TAG: Tiana_010_f
...the portion that got served on a bed of ice shavings. That's got to be Kristoff, right?

TAG: Tiana_011_f
Mm-hmm! He said that a chilled meal would be refreshing in the summer.

TAG: Tiana_012_f
You know what? Can't blame him; that does sound like an interesting idea, if non-traditional.
