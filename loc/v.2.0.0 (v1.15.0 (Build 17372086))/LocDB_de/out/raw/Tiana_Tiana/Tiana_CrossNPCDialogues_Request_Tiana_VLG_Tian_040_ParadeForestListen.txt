Tiana, this parade is so fun!

I'm so glad you're having a nice time, Minnie!

The throws, the costumes... and Stitch scatting away like he's in a jazz band! It's all so wonderful!

Stitch's singing sure was a surprise, but it really lends the parade that taste of home!

I can't wait to see who else comes out to celebrate!
