Ooh, that's a tough question...

Well, I love talking to the guests, planning the menu...

TAG: Tiana_001_f
And I always enjoy when I get to do a little cooking.

What's it like talking to guests?

Planning the menu?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You don't cook everything?

Oh, it's wonderful! I want everyone to feel welcome at Tiana's Palace.

So, I make sure I get to know them a bit. Learn where they're from, maybe what they're celebrating.

I can't tell you how many interesting folks I've met since we opened!

TAG: Tiana_005_f
That's right. A menu takes a lot of planning. I need to choose recipes based on what's in season...

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Give people choices but not overwhelm them.

TAG: Tiana_007_f
And, of course, you want to make the menu itself look pretty.

TAG: Tiana_008_f
You eat with your eyes first â and that starts with the menu!

Well, I develop the recipes for every dish, right down to the garnish and how it's plated.

TAG: Tiana_010_f
But I have a marvelous team of cooks who do the actual cooking.

TAG: Tiana_011_f
That way I can be in the dining room greeting guests and making sure everything runs just right.
