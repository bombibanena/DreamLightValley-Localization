Thank you for all your help, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Tiana_001_f
No problem! The happiness of the critters here is just as important to me as the Villagers.

TAG: Tiana_002_f
That little creature just made me think so much of my dear friend Louis back home.

TAG: Tiana_003_f
He's so friendly and clever but doesn't quite fit in with the other reptiles.

TAG: Tiana_004_f
I couldn't just leave Little Louis without a friend.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sure you'll be great friends for a long time!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Well, that's just another reason why you fit in well here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Give it time; I'm sure you'll have animal friends in each Biome!

TAG: Tiana_006_f
Any ideas for your future in the Valley?

TAG: Tiana_007_f
Oh, I'm working on some new ideas.

TAG: Tiana_008_f
I want to find more ways to share the joy of food with others.

TAG: Tiana_009_f
Well, I'll let you focus on that then.

TAG: Tiana_010_f
Talk to you later, Tiana!
