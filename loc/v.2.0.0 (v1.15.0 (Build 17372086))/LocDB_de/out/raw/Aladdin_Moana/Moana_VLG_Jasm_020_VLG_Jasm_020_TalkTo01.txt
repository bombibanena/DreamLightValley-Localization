Moana! I could use your help with something... Jasmine and I need to make this extremely important key to open a Secret Journal, but we need some <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem> for the crafting recipe.

TAG: Moana_001_f
<ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem> for a key? Hmm... That actually sparks a memory...

TAG: Moana_002_f
Pun definitely intended!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Hah, good one!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Funny! But, um, the Sea Sand Sparks...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There's no time for puns!

TAG: Moana_003_f
Thanks! Now, about those Sea Sand Sparks...

TAG: Moana_014_f
I remember helping with this before the Forgetting. Jasmine was trying to keep the key safe. That <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem> you're talking about is magical, isn't it?

TAG: Moana_015_f
Well, it grew out of an Enchanted Flower in Jasmine's House. So yes, I think it's pretty magical.

TAG: Moana_007_f
That means you won't need regular Sea Sand Sparks. They'll have to come from a particular sort of <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Torch</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Do you know what kind of torch I need to make that happen?

TAG: Moana_009_f
Actually, I do! Merlin taught me to make a Sea Sand Torch that never goes out. We'll have to make one from scratch and include a gemstone to ensure the Sea Sand Sparks are as bright as can be.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That makes sense.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What does the shine do?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I love when things are extra shiny!

TAG: Moana_010_f
Great!

TAG: Moana_013_f
When the <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem> shine brightly, that'll bring the magic to the key, and then it'll open that <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_016_f
Gotcha. If you tell me what we need, I can <Lore>gather all the materials</Lore> so we can make the Sea Sand Torch and gather those sparks.

TAG: Moana_017_f
Sure! I'd be happy to.

TAG: Moana_011_f
I'm glad you asked.

TAG: Moana_012_f
I know a giant monster crab who does too. But this isn't just for looks, you know.

TAG: Moana_004_f
Right! The Sea Sand Sparks!

TAG: Moana_005_f
Right. Ahem...
