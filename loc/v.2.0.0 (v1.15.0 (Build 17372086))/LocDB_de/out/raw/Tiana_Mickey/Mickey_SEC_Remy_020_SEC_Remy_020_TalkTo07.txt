I was wondering, though: Any chance that you remember anything about who made the dish?

I feel like the Valley is just waiting for this person to return.

Gosh, let me think...

Hmm... I remember she was real savvy at business... Oh! And she was a great singer, too!

Wait â {PlayerName} â what's that?

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Great; thanks, Mickey! I'll keep doing the rounds with the dish. Hopefully others will have their own memories to share.
