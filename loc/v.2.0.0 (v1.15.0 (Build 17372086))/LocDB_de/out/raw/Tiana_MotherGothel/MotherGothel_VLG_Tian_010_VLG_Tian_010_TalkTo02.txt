Hey, Mother Gothel, I've got a surprise for you!

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Well, I certainly hope it's better than the last gift you gave me.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Creative, it was not.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think you'll like this one!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Wow, rude.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's okay; I can find someone else.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Perhaps...

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
Well, go on â what is this surprise?

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
You're invited to the grand opening of Tiana's Meal Stall!

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
It's a new spot in the Valley where people can swing by for a nice meal and a cool outdoor terrace to hang out in!

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Oh... I was hoping it would be something interesting.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Tiana means well, but her food...

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Well, I suppose it can't be worse than it was before the Forgetting. I distinctly remember it being far too intense for my tastes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Are you... sure you even want to come?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The food was too hot?

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Why, of course I do! Tiana needs someone to give her an honest opinion.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
The rest of you coddle her. She needs some proper motherly advice.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
Um, okay... I guess I'll let her know that you're coming.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
I'm sure she'll be overjoyed!

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
Oh, I doubt that...

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
No, the temperature was fine. The spice level, however...

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
I'll come and give my HONEST opinion of Tiana's new food. I never sugarcoat things merely to spare someone's feelings.

TAG: MotherGothel_000_f
I never sugarcoat things merely to spare someone's feelings.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
Oh, I'm teasing, dear. You really must stop taking everything so seriously!
