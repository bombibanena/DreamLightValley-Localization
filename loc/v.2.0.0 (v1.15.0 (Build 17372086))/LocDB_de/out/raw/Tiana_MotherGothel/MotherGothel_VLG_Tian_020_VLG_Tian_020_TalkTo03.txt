Okay Mother Gothel, we've got your new garden set up.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Hmm... Yes, I suppose that is acceptable.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Can you let out Little Louis now?

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Now now, don't be hasty, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
I may have reconsidered. There are other things I requireâ

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A deal's a deal, Mother Gothel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Okay, I can dig up the garden then.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
How rude!

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
I'm sure someone else in the Valley can help me get Little Louis free.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Really now, {PlayerName}, I was only teasing!

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
You take everything so seriously.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
Here. Take the key.

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Thank you.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
Now please, leave me in peace.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Gladly.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Perhaps, but I don't believe I ever said I would release your little pet.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Ugh, I'm not surprised.
