Hi, Mother Gothel! I hope you're enjoying the food.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
This? Ugh. Definitely not!

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Oh? Why not?

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
It's as I said before: The intensity is far too high!

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
It's like eating fire.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
It's intolerable!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I really like it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Eating fire? Do you mean... it's spicy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You don't have to eat it if you don't like it.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Well, there's no accounting for taste.

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
Well, I'll let you relax.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
And Mother Gothel...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Milk or bread can help with lingering spiciness.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Have a nice day!

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
You couldn't have told me that BEFORE I ate this monstrosity?!

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Oh, I'm afraid all chances of that are ruined.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
{PlayerName}, I'm familiar with all the best spices and herbs. This is something else.

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
I know that. No need to be patronizing, dear.
