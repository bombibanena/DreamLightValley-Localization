Hello, Fairy Godmother! Sally and I were hoping you might like to help us with a sewing project.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It would mean a lot to her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You have the magic touch.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Her ideas were a little too different for Daisy and Minnie's current project.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
Oh, you're such a dear. Why, I'd be thrilled to lend a hand... or a wand!

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
She mentioned the idea of a quilt.

TAG: FairyGodMother_000_f
What a splendid project! But what sort of a quilt? Is there a pattern or a color theme?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Maybe... Dreamlight Valley-inspired?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Can we magically find an idea?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
She said a quilt "of dried cobwebs" to Daisy?

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
Yes, yes... I think that could work...

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
I know! A patchwork piece to bring back fond Valley memories. But for a quilt... well, we'll need cloth scraps, of course.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Where would we get scrap material?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We could ask Goofy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I could cut up some clothes?

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Not to worry, {PlayerName}. My magic will handle the fabric part.

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
If you <Lore>bring me memorabilia of your special moments in the Valley</Lore>, I'll turn them into scraps of fabric that Sally and I can sew together.

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
Oh! Like an <Lore>ancient Crystal from the Mystical Cave</Lore>!

TAG: FairyGodMother_020_f
Or that feather of Donald's I found <Lore>in the Forest of Valor</Lore>.

TAG: FairyGodMother_018_f
And I had such a good time making some <Lore>Fruit Salad with Mickey</Lore>...

TAG: FairyGodMother_019_f
Precisely! Items full of wonderful memories!

TAG: FairyGodMother_017_f
Guess I'll start treasure hunting!

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
Our quilting has begun. We're off to have such fun!

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Goofy sells fine pumpkins, but not fabric. Not to worry. I have some magic we might try.

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
Goodness, no, dear! I have some magic that will keep your wardrobe intact.

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
Hmm... Let me think... Magic... Dreamlight Magic...

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Oh, my! How interesting. Though... I suppose that might not appeal to everyone. Yet, the idea of cloth from a unique source is marvelous!

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
Magic touch? Oh, (ha-ha), yes, I suppose I do. What did you have in mind?

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
Different and wonderful, I imagine. Just like Sally. Well, {PlayerName}, I would love to assist!
