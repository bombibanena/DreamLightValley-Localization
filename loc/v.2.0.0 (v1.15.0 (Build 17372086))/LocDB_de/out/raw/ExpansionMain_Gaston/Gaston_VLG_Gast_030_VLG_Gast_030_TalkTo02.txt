Look at those!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
You like the pictures?

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I do. They capture my impressive jawline perfectly.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
And you look... adequate.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Gaston, you're so uncharitable.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I guess I need to work my neck more.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
My heart is broken.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Thank you!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Next we must show our results to the other Villagers.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Start with Maui. I'm sure he'll be very interested in our progress and how it involves coconuts.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
... Okay.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
And also McDuck and Rapunzel.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Any reason why I should see them in particular?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Well, they're pictures of me, so who wouldn't want to see that? And as for you, they'll admire how much I've helped you.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Just remember to be Gastonian as you show them off.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
All right, here goes nothing!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I am 100% not going to be Gastonian for this task.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Remember to show off your neck!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
It's only your first day on the Gastonian program â it usually takes two.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
A common effect around me!
