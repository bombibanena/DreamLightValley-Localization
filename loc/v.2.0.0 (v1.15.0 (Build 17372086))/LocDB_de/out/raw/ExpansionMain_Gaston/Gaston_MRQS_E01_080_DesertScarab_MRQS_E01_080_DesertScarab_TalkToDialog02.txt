Hmm... No sign of the vault key. Well, we tried! I say we return to the capital of Gastonia. You can write a song about me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We need that key!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The. Isle. Is. In. DANGER!!!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You don't deserve a song for failing.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Without the key, there's no way to get that Jewel of Time. Without the Jewels, the Isle is doomed!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Hmm... but what if there IS no <Lore>Scarab Key</Lore> and we're already doomed?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Scarab Key?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why would Jafar send us on a fake quest?

TAG: Gaston_019_f
You never mentioned it was a Scarab.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Oh, what does it matter what the key LOOKS like? We'll never find it.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
We've looked in TWO places! TWO! Haven't we done enough?!

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Not really.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
If you care so much, keep searching. Search the Wastes! <Lore>Check the quicksand!</Lore> You'll see I'm right!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
You're clearly not as skilled as me, but go ahead! Try and be the hero! I'll wait.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
He's a wizard. Doesn't that explain everything?

TAG: Gaston_020_f
I think you're just looking for excuses to bail.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Me, fail? Impossible! We're changing tactics. Old hunting strategy â we stay still and the prey comes to you.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
The "prey" is a key... I don't see that strategy working.
