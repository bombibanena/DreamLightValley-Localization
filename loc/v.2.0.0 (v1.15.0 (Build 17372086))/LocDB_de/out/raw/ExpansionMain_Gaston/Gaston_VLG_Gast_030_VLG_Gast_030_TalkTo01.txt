So? How do you feel?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Ready to lift some weights!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Kinda bloated...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
AMAZING!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Excellent.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Was eating everything raw really all that important?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Yes! The food will cook inside us from the heat of our efforts.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's not how digestion works.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
If you say so!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Please never say that particular group of words again.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, how little you know.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
For the sake of getting stronger?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Beats me!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Okay Gaston, what's next?

TAG: Gaston_021_f
We must create a place to work our muscles. We'll build it from scratch with materials that we've ripped from nature!

TAG: Gaston_022_f
We'd call that a gym. And you mean materials that I gather for you?

TAG: Gaston_023_f
A "gym"... I like that name!

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Gather some <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Brass Ingots</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Stones</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Gaston_026_f
And see McDuck about a mirror. A large one!

TAG: Gaston_027_f
Do I dare ask why we need a mirror?

TAG: Gaston_028_f
You disappoint me, {PlayerName}. Why would anyone work their muscles if they can't watch themselves do so?

TAG: Gaston_029_f
Ah, but how do you know that it's working without a mirror?!

TAG: Gaston_032_f
Make sure you also <Lore>find Maui</Lore> and invite him to our gym.

TAG: Gaston_033_f
As the only other impressively muscled person around, he'll want to see what we've made.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
All right, I'm off.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I do!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
No promises.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
The Gastonian diet does that sometimes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ready to lift weights!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Fine, I guess.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Nervous, but that has nothing to do with the shake.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Great!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
What about you? Are you feeling all right after eating so much raw food?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Of course! The heat of working my muscles will cook the food inside me!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
You'll need more energy than that, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I'm here. There's nothing to be nervous about!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
That's actually what I'm nervous about...
