Is it time for our treasure hunt?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Yes, but I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you first, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Oh? Is it that your puny arms can't carry the same amount of treasure as I can?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's really not that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll try to be nice about this...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Okay, I don't feel bad anymore.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Well, what is it then?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
I want to be diplomatic about this...

TAG: Gaston_019_f
This is boring. Put the Scarab together!

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Ah-ha! It's about to go! After the Scarab!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Yes, yes... go on.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
What are you blathering about?

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Well, you have a tendency to react strongly to things...
