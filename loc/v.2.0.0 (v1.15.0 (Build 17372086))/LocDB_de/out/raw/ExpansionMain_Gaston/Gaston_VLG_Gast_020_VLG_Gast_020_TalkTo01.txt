Look at that: a memory pointing to lost treasures!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Well done, Gaston!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You just congratulated... yourself?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Thanks! Uhh... wait...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm going to pretend you said "Well done, {PlayerName}."

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Of course. After all, I'm the one who pointed you down the path of adventure!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Gaston the hero, eh? I like the sound of that.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Great! Time to start searching!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Now, we can go hunt down those lost treasures!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Yes! And once I'm in possession of those valuables, Belle will surely be impressed!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Gaston... who knows who those treasures actually belong to?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
You're saying if I find them, I can't keep them?

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Probably not.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
You're no fun.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Think of it this way: If we can return those items to their owners, you'll be seen as a hero for finding them!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Oh, are you wondering why I congratulated myself?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Yes!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Well, I am the one who pointed you down the path of adventure!

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Did you say something?
