Look at this place!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, it's pretty rough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Bit of a fixer-upper, but not that bad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Gaston, it looks terrible.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Hey! Only I'm allowed to say that. But you're right...

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Well, first we need to clear out all this sand and do something about that portrait of mine.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
It's insulting for it to be in such a state!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Try using your fancy Hourglass on it, and let me know when you're done.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You're not helping?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
... Okay, I guess.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Sure!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
This will take a bit of work.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Normally, I'd just tell LeFou to handle things...

TAG: Gaston_010_f
But?

TAG: Gaston_011_f
...

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Gaston? Hello?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Oh, uh, what was I saying?

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Renovations.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Right!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
I'm overseeing the work â that's helping!

TAG: Gaston_021_f
All right, time to get to work!

TAG: Gaston_019_f
A poor attitude doesn't make the work easier, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Excellent, LeFâ err, I mean {PlayerName}.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Just what I was thinking!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
... I don't often say that other people are right. But...
