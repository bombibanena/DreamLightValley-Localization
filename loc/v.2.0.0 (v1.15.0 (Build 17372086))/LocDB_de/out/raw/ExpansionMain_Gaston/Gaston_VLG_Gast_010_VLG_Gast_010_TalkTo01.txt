All done! How do you feel about it now?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Oh no, this isn't right. This isn't right at all.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It does look rather bare...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hey, I worked hard to clean this up!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Don't worry, Gaston. We can fix it up!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Ugh. I can't believe I have to tell you how to do everything. LeFou would just know what I want.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Now, let me see... Yes!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
The whole lodge requires furniture and careful renovation.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Tell me â is my old friend Scrooge McDuck still running that shop of his?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He sure is!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're... friends with him?

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Excellent!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
He supplied funding before I set out from the Valley â I'm sure he'd want to invest in me again!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Bring him some <ActivityItem>Alexandrite</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Jade</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Spinel</ActivityItem>. He should be raring to fund this new venture!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Of course! We're both admired for our cunning and leave-nothing-unventured attitudes!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I guess that makes sense.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Did you? Oh, I suppose you did.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
You're sounding more and more like LeFou every day!
