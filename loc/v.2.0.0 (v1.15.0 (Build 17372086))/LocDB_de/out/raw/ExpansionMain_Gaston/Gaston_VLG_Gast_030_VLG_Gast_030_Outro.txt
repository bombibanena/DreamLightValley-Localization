All done showing off the pictures!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
You could have just been honest. There's no need for the whole pretense.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
{PlayerName}, have you learned nothing from the Gastonian Experience?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I guess not.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh no, I did.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Excellent. Did Maui like them?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Maui? Well, he did like the coconut workout gear...

TAG: Gaston_007_f
But he also said that you should spend more time working out if you want a neck as thick as his.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Oh...

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Gaston... are you about to cry?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
No! Crying is not Gastonian! I'm... sweating from my eyes.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Was all of this just so you could talk to Maui? Make a friend?

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Of course not!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Well, at least you can continue to improve your neck with the workout gear.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
But I'm sorry to say that you just don't understand what it's like to be Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
All this cleverness of yours? It... gets in the way!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's true: I am too clever.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Gaston, no, I can dumb myself down!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
You'll never be a new LeFou or work as my sidekick.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
I... I want to be alone.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
All right, we can talk later, I guess. But I think what you're really in need of is... a friend.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Perhaps you're right. I'll consider what you've said.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
At least you did improve your neck.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Oh, it's too late for that.
