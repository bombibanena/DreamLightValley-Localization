{PlayerName}! I caught you just in time!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Did you know that there are LIONS here?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure! I invited them myself!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What? How did that happen?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There might be tigers and bears as well!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
You did?

TAG: Gaston_003_f
{PlayerName}, you should have told me you were creating a hunting reserve.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
I'm really not...

TAG: Gaston_005_f
You're lucky I'm here.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Tone it down, Gaston. No hunting the other Villagers.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
... Fine, but I'll be ready in case anything happens.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
No beast stands a chance against me!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I think you should leave them alone...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Have you ever seen a lion before?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
We'll see about that...

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Seriously Gaston, leave them alone.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
They're guests here, just like you.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Very well, but if I get the sense that they're stalking me... I'll have no choice but to act.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
No. They must be exceedingly rare in French forests.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
But I've heard of them. Powerful, dangerous, majestic creatures...

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Invaders! They'll stalk us all; I promise you.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Oh, it's worse than I thought...
