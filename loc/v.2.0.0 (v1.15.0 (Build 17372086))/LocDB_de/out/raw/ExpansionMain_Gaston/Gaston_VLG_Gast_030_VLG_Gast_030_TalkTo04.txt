New clothes! Hmm, you look... acceptable.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I look AMAZING.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Gaston, I look like you...

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Yes, I'm sure you think so.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
So what's next?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I'll introduce you to the Gastonian diet, and then you'll be properly fueled for my incredible muscle-working routine.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Do I dare ask about the Gastonian diet?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
It's simple, {PlayerName}, and effective.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Raw eggs. Lots of them. You'll find <ActivityItem>Cobra Eggs</ActivityItem> around the Glittering Dunes.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
And raw piranha meat. Not my traditional meal, but I've found eating dangerous animals to be especially energizing!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I should have expected this.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Yeah, I'm not down with consuming animal proteins.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
All that raw food is a little iffy though...

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Well, I suppose you could make yourself a... what did Donald call it...? Oh yes, a <ActivityItem>Workout Shake</ActivityItem> instead.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll go with the <ActivityItem>Cobra Eggs</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Piranha</ActivityItem> after all.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Workout shake!

TAG: Gaston_026_f
Off you go, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Fine, but make sure you bring my meal as well?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
And I'll prepare a Gastonian meal for you, in case you change your mind.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Well, I suppose you could make yourself a... what did Donald call it...? Oh yes, a <ActivityItem>Workout Shake</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
But are you sure you don't want to eat like me? You are looking at me, aren't you?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
My less-stylish cousin, perhaps. Still, it's an improvement over what you were wearing before.
