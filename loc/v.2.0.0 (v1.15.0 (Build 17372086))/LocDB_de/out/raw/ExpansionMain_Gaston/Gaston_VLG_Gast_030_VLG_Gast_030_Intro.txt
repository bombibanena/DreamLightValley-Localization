{PlayerName}, you're late!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm so sorry!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
... We had an appointment?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You need to learn some patience.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Well, you're forgiven.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Now, are you going to help me? I don't have all day!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Okay, what's going on?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Nope â see you later!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
I've been thinking, and I know what's needed to make you a better sidekick.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Nice!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Once again... not your sidekick.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I'm going to introduce you to the Gastonian Experience!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
If you understand what it's like to be me, you'll know how to be a better sidekick.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Okay... and what exactly does that entail?

TAG: Gaston_013_f
First you'll need better clothes, because I would never wear... that.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Rude!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Hey, not fair!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Okay, I can try a new style.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Yes, visiting me in such an unworthy outfit was rude, but I forgive you.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Return to me when you have clothing befitting Gaston...

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Red on top, black trousers or what you will, and a devastatingly handsome demeanor.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
The Gastonian Experience is not fair, but it is just.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
That... makes no sense.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
To you, perhaps.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Marvelous!

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Oh, you will be soon!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Fine. But I'll be waiting!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Well, no. But you should have known I had something for you to do.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Grr...
