{PlayerName}! You're just in time.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Hey, Gaston. What am I just in time for?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Nope, never mind, I'm out.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
You're just in time to entertain me! I've grown bored.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Go on, do something amusing.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
I don't know why I come see you...

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Because you idolize me, of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ha!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh yeah, that's definitely it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Nah, it's morbid curiosity.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
What do you normally do for fun?

TAG: Gaston_011_f
I hunt! And then talk about my success.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
No. Not happening here.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Well then, don't just stand there; suggest something!

TAG: Gaston_023_f
What about fishing?

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Do I look like an old man sleeping through his life?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Kinda, to be honest.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Okay, that was kinda funny.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Well, I'm not! But... *sigh* I will tell you, and only you... I have fished before.

TAG: Gaston_025_f
During my time in the Glittering Dunes, I tried fishing in the quicksand.

TAG: Gaston_026_f
It did not go well.

TAG: Gaston_027_f
Oh, well why don't we try fishing in the Tangle? The fish there might be easier to catch... but they're far more dangerous...

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Danger? Now you've got my attention!

TAG: Gaston_029_f
Oh yeah, there are <ActivityItem>Piranhas</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Electric Eels</ActivityItem>, and even those weird <ActivityItem>Prisma Shrimp</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Gaston_030_f
What are we waiting for then?!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I bet I can find a spot with more interesting fish than you...

TAG: Gaston_014_f
I was not joking! But... *sigh* I will tell you, and only you... I have fished before.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
I want to see how it's possible to survive without complexity of thought.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
{PlayerName}... don't you know by now, I can survive anything?!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Wait, come back!
