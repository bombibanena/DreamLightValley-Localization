Marvelous. Meat is available again! And everyone will know they have Gaston to thank when I throw a roaring party for the Village at my lodge!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I think I'm getting used to not getting credit...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Hey, I helped!

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Sounds like you're really settling into your role as a sidekick!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Now then, I've heard that not only do you have the power to control time, but you're a cook, too?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I dabble.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I could beat Remy in a cooking contest.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Good! Once you buy some meat, you can whip up a solid meal for me!

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Excuse me, "buy" the meat? I worked so hard to get your stall going again and you're making me pay?!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Of course! If I give you any for free, then everyone will expect it all to be free.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I guess that makes sense...

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I still think you should make an exception for me.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Now, think carefully about what you're going to cook for me.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
You sure? I'm kinda new to cooking with these Ingredients...

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Well, there are a few writings about food around here. Or just... just make something! Be sure it's large and meaty!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Okay, a couple meat dishes, no problem.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
A "couple"?! No no, that won't do. I want everyone at my gathering to know how generous a host I am!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm on it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Anything else, Your Highness?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Awfully demanding, aren't we?

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Try to be a little quicker this time, won't you?

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Bring me <ActivityItem>four meat-based dishes</ActivityItem>, understood?

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Yup!

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Ha! I could get used to being called that!

TAG: Gaston_020_f
I know my worth.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
{PlayerName}, I know how sidekicks like to gossip.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
If I make an exception for you, the whole Valley will know before long.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Now think carefully about what you're going to cook for me.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Did you? I don't remember that...
