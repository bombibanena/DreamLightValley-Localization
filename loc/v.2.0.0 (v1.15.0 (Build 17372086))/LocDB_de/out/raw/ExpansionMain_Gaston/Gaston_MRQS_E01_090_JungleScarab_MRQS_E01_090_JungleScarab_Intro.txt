Hey, Gaston â did you do your rugged contemplation of nature? How do you feel?

TAG: Gaston_023_f
I don't blame her â I'll head to see her next, then.

TAG: Gaston_029_f
I'll come with you! You'll need someone charming like me to deal with people for you.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Oh, uhhh, not sure if that's such a great idea...

TAG: Gaston_005_f
What? Why not?

TAG: Gaston_035_f
Actually, I have something else only you can do.

TAG: Gaston_036_f
I bet I'll find the other Scarab piece soon, and then we'll be off to the vault!

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
We'll need some adventuring supplies.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
Can you pack some food and drink for us?

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
I need you to talk to Jafar and get a hint of what awaits us in the Cave.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
{PlayerName}, I make it a habit of ignoring all talk of feelings.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Did you find the next piece of the Scarab?

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Not yet. Any chance you've got leads on the next half of the Scarab Key? Jafar said it might be in the Wild Tangle.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
The Mirage Wizard may be right. I've been over every inch of the Dunes, and I haven't found the other half.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
{PlayerName}, I've a thought! I once spotted a blonde girl dashing around the Wild Tangle.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Maybe the jungle girl can help.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Oh, you mean Rapunzel?

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Is that her name? The one time I saw her, she took one look at Coconut LeFou and dashed off.

TAG: Gaston_037_f
You're right. I am an expert on adventuring! I'll get the ol' explorer's pack going.

TAG: Gaston_038_f
Awesome, that's what I like to hear, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_039_f
No one prepares for adventure like Gaston!

TAG: Gaston_040_f
Great, I'll check back <Lore>after I talk with Rapunzel in the Wild Tangle</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_041_f
Of course I can! I know the desert plants like the back of my incredibly muscled hand.

TAG: Gaston_042_f
The Mirage Wizard will crumble at my intense questioning!
