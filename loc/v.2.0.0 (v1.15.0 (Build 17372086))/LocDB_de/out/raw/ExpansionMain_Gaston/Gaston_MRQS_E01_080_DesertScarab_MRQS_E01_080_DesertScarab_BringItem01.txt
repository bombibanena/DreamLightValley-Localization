There, is that better? Got your strength back?

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I've never lost my strength, {PlayerName}! Don't be ridiculous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's agree to disagree.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You can't even admit you were thirsty?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let's arm wrestle.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
I'll disâ no, agree to that.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Now, what are you doing here in Gastonia?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Excuse me? "Gastonia"?

TAG: Player_003_choice_003_f
I'm on an important mission.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Yes. Where do you think you're standing?

TAG: Gaston_029_f
In the <Lore>Glittering Dunes</Lore>...

TAG: Gaston_030_f
Hardly. This is Gastonia, and I am the ruler!

TAG: Gaston_031_f
I've been here for quite some time. So I decided it should have a proper name. You know, something I came up with!

TAG: Gaston_032_f
What are you doing here?

TAG: Gaston_034_f
Well, I'd done all I wanted to in my village â hunted all the trophies, impressed all the townspeople. There were no more feats of daring I could do to gain their accolades.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Oh no, that's terrible!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I'm sensing there might be a girl involved.

TAG: Gaston_035_f
It is!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I'm looking for the Jewel of Time. Have you seen any magical-looking gems around "Gastonia"?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
No, but I'm also looking for treasure. Lots of it! I can make use of youâ

TAG: Gaston_011_f
No, actually Iâ

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Do you have experience as a lackey?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Gaston, I'm dealing with something pretty important here.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Eternity Isle is at risk â if I can't find the other Jewels of Time, the whole Island may be destroyed!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Hmm... That does seem bad. But is it really worse than me, Gaston, being without someone to sing my praises and do my bidding?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
If the Isle is destroyed, no one sings ANYONE'S praises.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You have no perspective.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I think you're dealing with sunstroke.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Oh... that is a problem then.

TAG: Gaston_025_f
You need a hero to fix this for you. *sigh* Fine. I'll do it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
You? A hero?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What's your plan, "hero"?

TAG: Gaston_026_f
Of course!

TAG: Gaston_027_f
I'll lead the way. We'll begin at my encampment, the capital of Gastonia.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
You're notâ *sigh* You know what? Lead the way. I'll <Lore>follow you to your encampment</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Of course not. Who would want such a thing? Sounds itchy.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Even I can't stroke the sun, {PlayerName}. It's up in the sky.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Okay, moving on.

TAG: Gaston_036_f
Exactly.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Oh, I was thirsty, but I was NEVER weak!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Ha-ha-ha! I'd crush you like a bug.
