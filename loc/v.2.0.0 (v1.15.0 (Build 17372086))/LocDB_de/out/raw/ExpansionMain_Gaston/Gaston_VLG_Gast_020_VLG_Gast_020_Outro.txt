Gaston! The rightful owners of all the items have been determined!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Excellent. I'll return them so they can all thank me!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
So? How did that feel?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
It was... pleasant.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Though no one was grateful enough to give us a proper reward!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Doing good is its own reward!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So greedy!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They said "thank you," didn't they?

TAG: Gaston_006_f
You sound like someone who's gotten used to not being rewarded.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
I'M NOT YOUR SIDEKICK!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Not with that attitude you aren't!

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Run along for now. I'll be in touch if I need you again.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Still, I can tell that you did your best to entertain me today.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
It's important to reward a sidekick when they're at least attempting to do well.

TAG: Gaston_011_f

TAG: Gaston_000_f
If you put up fishing trophies in your House as well, you can imagine you're me.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
So, here, have this!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Aww, thanks Gaston!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
You may not be the best sidekick, but you did help me discover the benefit of being a hero.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
They are, aren't they?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Yes. But words can't be hung on my walls.
