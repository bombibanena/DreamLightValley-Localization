How are you doing with your new sidekick, Gaston?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Well, it's going to take some training...

TAG: Gaston_003_f
But I like having a dedicated sidekick again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm so happy for you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Does that mean you're going to be less demanding?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I hope the sidekick is as happy as you...

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Of course this means you're no longer a tentative sidekick.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I know it's upsetting, but we can't always get everything we want.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I'll... try to survive.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
You're very brave, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Now then...

TAG: Gaston_012_f
You did do a fair amount of work on my behalf.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
I suppose I should reward you for it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How kind of you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's one way that people show gratitude.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Oh, it's not necessary!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
It is, isn't it?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
At least you're honest about it, I guess.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Here you are, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Well, despite everything... I'm glad that you've settled into the Valley.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Yes, well... the people here are rather odd and don't properly appreciate me...

TAG: Gaston_022_f
...but I am starting to feel at home.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Great! If you need me, I'll be around...

TAG: Gaston_024_f
But maybe ask your sidekick first!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Gratitude? Ugh, don't tell anyone.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
You don't want the gift? I'd be happy to keep it for myself.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
I didn't say that!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
No. Why would I lower my standards?

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Their happiness isn't my concern.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Doing their job is!
