All done, Gaston! I've got three potential candidates for you.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Marvelous! Tell me about each of them.

TAG: Player_002_f
Okay, let me tell you about...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...Stitch.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...Olaf.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...Donald.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
He's a little furry blue alien. He's extremely strong, bulletproof, and can see in the dark...

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Bulletproof? Hmm, that has definite potential. What about his personality?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Something of a trickster. Mischievous, but means well.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
All right...

TAG: Gaston_027_f
I'll need to think carefully about this.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
They're all pretty awesome.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
It's an important decision!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Thinking isn't part of the Gastonian Experience!

TAG: Gaston_028_f
I don't want "pretty" anything, I want "incredibly" perfect.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
On it!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
This... might not turn out how you're expecting.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Okay, I'm off now.

TAG: Gaston_031_f
Thinking... thinking... Donald is out.

TAG: Gaston_032_f
I need a sidekick who doesn't lose his temper. Emotions are... inconvenient.

TAG: Gaston_033_f
Fair enough.

TAG: Gaston_034_f
Hmm... I want you to introduce some Gastonian tasks to the remaining candidates.

TAG: Gaston_035_f
And I'll watch to see how well they perform.

TAG: Gaston_036_f
All right, what are we doing?

TAG: Gaston_037_f
Start with Stitch. Have him prepare a proper Gastonian breakfast dish.

TAG: Gaston_038_f
And Olaf... See if he can conquer the wilds of nature.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Excellent!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
I'll be watching!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
And {PlayerName}... I'll be eating the breakfast as part of the test. Here â make sure Stitch knows what I like.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Well, if it goes badly, I'll know that you're partly to blame.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Hey, not fair!

TAG: Gaston_029_f
Very true.

TAG: Gaston_030_f
I know. But sometimes it's unavoidable.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
He's quite charismatic and likes to put on a show!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
That reminds me of LeFou already!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
LeFou is quite the performer for such a small man.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
Well, Olaf is just the sweetest, kindest Villager you'll find in the Valley.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Also a great partner for trivia contests.

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Hmm, interesting...

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Donald is Scrooge McDuck's nephew.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
I've seen him around... He always seems upset.

TAG: Gaston_024_f
That's Donald for you. The smallest injustice really riles him up.

TAG: Gaston_025_f
Something to consider...
