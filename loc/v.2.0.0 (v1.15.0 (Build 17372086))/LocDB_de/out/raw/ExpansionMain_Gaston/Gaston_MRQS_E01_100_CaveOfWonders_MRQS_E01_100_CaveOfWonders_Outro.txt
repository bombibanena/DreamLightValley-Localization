{PlayerName} â you're back!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Yeah! Mission complete.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
You brought me treasure? Excellent!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sorry, no treasure.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I brought the best treasure â acceptance.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
What?! Then why have I been waiting here?

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Though it is looking rather bare... I had grand plans before I got sidetracked by the Mirage Wizard... That's it! I will resume my plans!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Visit me later. I'll require your assistance for some projects!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'll see what I can do!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maybe once I deal with the Time Rifts...

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I guess that's a question you'll have to answer for yourself.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Cheer up, though â I found the Jewel of Time, and I'll soon be able to save Eternity Isle!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
I suppose that is good news...

TAG: Gaston_015_f
What are you going to do now?

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Well, without treasure, I'll have to do something else to gain the admiration of the people here.

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Once I finish dealing with the Time Rifts, I've got big plans for Eternity Isle!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
You could even visit the mainland if you want.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
I'll consider it. But Gastonia will always be the attraction everyone comes to see.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Here, you should have Coconut LeFou. I don't need him... err... it anymore.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll treasure him, thank you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Thanks, I guess?

TAG: Gaston_018_f
You'd better treat him with respect.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
My impressive craftsmanship should be admired!

TAG: Gaston_021_f
Don't worry, Gaston. Both you and Coconut LeFou will find a home here.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
You're welcome.

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Fine. If you must have priorities.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Is that supposed to be funny?

TAG: Gaston_011_f
I don't know; I'm pretty amused now.
