Impressive! And that treasure will soon be mine!

TAG: Gaston_025_f
If it's guarded by a giant cat head, the riches inside must be of enormous value!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
Gaston, I really need to talk to you.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
Now? Can't it wait until we're inside?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm going to try to break the news to you gently.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's tough-love time, Gaston.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I can't wait to see your reaction to this...

TAG: Gaston_000_f
{PlayerName}, you can't break things gently. If you're gentle, they don't break.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
I'm more... a rack of antlers mounted on a fine mahogany panel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, I can see that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
If it means you won't fight me on this... fine.

TAG: Gaston_019_f
I'm sorry, Gaston... but you can't come with me into the vault.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
What?! And also... Why?!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
It's part of the magic of the vault â only a Diamond in the Rough can enter.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
... And...?

TAG: Gaston_005_f
You're not pure-of-heart enough to enter. The magic would reject you.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I understand.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Really?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Of course. I'm clearly no Diamond in the Rough.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
It is obvious, isn't it? Manly energy wafts off me like desperation off a peasant.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Wow, I suddenly can't wait to get away from you.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Make sure you bring back buckets of treasure for me!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
You couldn't handle me in a fight. I'm the best at wrestling!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
All right, I guess I'll head inside.

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Well, I am tough, and I do love it.

TAG: Gaston_001_f
You can't come with me into the vault.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
No one reacts like Gaston!

TAG: Gaston_018_f
You get to wait outside while I explore the vault and its treasures.
