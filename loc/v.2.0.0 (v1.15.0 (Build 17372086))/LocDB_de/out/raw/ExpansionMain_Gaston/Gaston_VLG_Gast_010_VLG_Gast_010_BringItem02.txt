{PlayerName}! You're back! I... I was...

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Err, never mind. I wasn't worried at all.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Aww, you were concerned?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
... Why?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm fine; don't worry!

TAG: Gaston_005_f
What? No, I wasn't!

TAG: Gaston_006_f
I never thought for a moment that you'd fail to return.

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Aww, Gaston, did my absence remind you of LeFou?

TAG: Gaston_003_f
No!

TAG: Gaston_021_f
But if it did, it's only because I'm an excellent leader to follow and not because I... miss anyone.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Gaston, you're adorable.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Okay, moving on...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's okay; I'm not going anywhere!

TAG: Gaston_008_f
No, I'm not! I'm powerful and impressive!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
Now then, I see you got supplies from McDuck.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Yup! He does want a cut of the profits from the lodge, though.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
... Profits?

TAG: Gaston_014_f
You know: the money left over after expenses?

TAG: Gaston_015_f
{PlayerName}, the lodge is a place for me to relax and for others to appreciate me, not spend money!

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Well... Scrooge won't be happy about that! He's expecting 50% of the profits.

TAG: Gaston_018_f
Hmm... I believe a share of zero is still zero, isn't it?

TAG: Gaston_019_f
You know what? Fair enough. That's Scrooge's fault for not asking for a business plan.

TAG: Gaston_020_f
Let's go fix things up!

TAG: Gaston_000_f
Marvelous! Start at the Scrooge McDuck Sign in front of the lodge.

TAG: Gaston_017_f
Well... Scrooge won't be happy about that! He's expecting 25% of the profits!

TAG: Gaston_022_f
He wanted 50%, but I managed to negotiate him down to 25%.

TAG: Gaston_023_f
Well done, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Yes, good idea.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Good, you have work to do!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
Worry? I don't worry!
