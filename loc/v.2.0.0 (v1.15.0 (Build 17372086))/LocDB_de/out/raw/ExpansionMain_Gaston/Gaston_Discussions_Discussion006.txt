The eating establishment here...

TAG: Gaston_001_f
The one run by Remy?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Yes, the rat!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
I don't understand why it's so popular.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's not to get?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's got incredibly tasty food!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There's such a wide menu!

TAG: Gaston_004_f
The food is so... complicated.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
I don't know what to tell you, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
People love the restaurant here!

TAG: Gaston_007_f
But why would they want a breakfast with more than one ingredient?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Dozens of raw eggs are so easy and muscle-building. Why, just look at me!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Eww.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Nobody's stopping you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I guess others don't have your dedication to fitness!

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Ah, but have you tried it?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Start off with just four dozen eggs, and let me know what you think.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
The rat tried!

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I ordered raw eggs, and he asked if I thought he was a grocer!

TAG: Gaston_013_f
That's true.

TAG: Gaston_014_f
I'm glad at least SOMEONE noticed.

TAG: Gaston_015_f
I didn't get biceps like these by caring about "tasty."

TAG: Gaston_016_f
Surely not as wide as my shoulders!
