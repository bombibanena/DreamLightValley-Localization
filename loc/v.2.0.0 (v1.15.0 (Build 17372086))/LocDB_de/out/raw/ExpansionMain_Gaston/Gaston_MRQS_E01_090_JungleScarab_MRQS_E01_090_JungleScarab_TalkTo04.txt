How you doing, Gaston?

TAG: Gaston_004_f
Very well. I am returning to the Gastonian path!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's... great?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't exactly get it, but yay for you.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
It is, isn't it?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
Now I just need you to find the Mirage Wizard's vault and get me that treasure. How goes the hunt?

TAG: Gaston_000_f
I'm working on it! I nearly have the <Lore>next piece of the Scarab Key</Lore>. Rapunzel has been a big help so far.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Did you finish your part of our adventure prep?

TAG: Gaston_001_f
Of course I did!

TAG: Gaston_002_f
But I did it my way. I don't need adventuring supplies when I can scale a cliff with my bare hands.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
I prepared with 500 push-ups!

TAG: Gaston_019_f
So when you said you'd help, you just did the opposite?

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Hardly. I did help! I stopped us from taking unnecessary supplies!

TAG: Gaston_022_f
Ugh, I guess wait here and <Lore>I'll come grab you when I've got both pieces of the Scarab Key</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Hardly. I did help! As the incredibly strong one, I'm now fueled to use my impressive strength!

TAG: Gaston_011_f
No. Flexing is always helpful to me and all who watch me.

TAG: Gaston_024_f
Of course I did!

TAG: Gaston_025_f
I tried to think of what sort of food and drink you'd want...

TAG: Gaston_026_f
How thoughtful of you!

TAG: Gaston_027_f
But then I realized that you probably have terrible taste in food and drink, so I ate four dozen eggs instead.

TAG: Gaston_028_f
Okay, scratch that last thought.

TAG: Gaston_029_f
Actually...

TAG: Gaston_030_f
I thought instead of talking to the Mirage Wizard...

TAG: Gaston_031_f
...I would practice my flexing to let him know who's in charge here.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
Indeed!
