Hello, Merlin! Jasmine and I need some help. She found a note about how to make <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem>, but we're not sure what they're for or what that means.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Hmm... <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem>...? Ah, yes! I remember the very things!

TAG: Merlin_023_f
You do? That's great!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
It is! Heh-heh. Now, let's see... I was instructing Jasmine on arcane flower magic before the Forgetting.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
We were using <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem> in our work. She's a most excellent researcher, you know.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
So they're magical?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Could they be dangerous?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What do they DO?

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Well, yes. "Enchanted" in the name rather says it all, doesn't it? And as with many things in Dreamlight Valley, they're sprinkled with very special magic.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Can you tell me anything else?

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Of course. The <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem> can be used to grow an <ActivityItem>Enchanted Flower</ActivityItem> that contains a secret.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
You put seeds in one pot, plant flowers in the other pots and <Lore>carefully tend to them so they flourish</Lore>. That will inspire the <ActivityItem>Enchanted Flower</ActivityItem> to grow. Plants do like to work together, after all.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Unfortunately, I... I can't remember anything else at the moment.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
An Enchanted Flower that contains a secret...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's mysterious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How exciting!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sounds suspicious...

TAG: Merlin_025_f
How can a flower contain a secret?

TAG: Merlin_028_f
Oh, I find secrets have a way of hiding in all sorts of interesting places.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
Do you remember ANYTHING else?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
I do know Jasmine and I were working together to keep this secret safe, andâ Oh! Yes! <Lore>There were seeds</Lore>!

TAG: Merlin_017_f
I put them in an envelope for safekeeping and hid it inside the Dreamlight Library for Jasmine's return.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
You may <Lore>search the Library to find the Envelope of Seeds</Lore> if you like. The seeds are sure to help you uncover the Enchanted Flower's secret.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
I wonder what this secret could possibly be?

TAG: Merlin_029_f
If you and Princess Jasmine are on the case, I suspect we'll find out soon enough!

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Who is keeping such a well-hidden secret?

TAG: Merlin_030_f
Now, now, not everyone who has secrets is hiding them with ill intent.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Perhaps. But then, you've never shied away from danger, have you?

TAG: Merlin_020_f
I suppose not... but I need to know more about this before I go on.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Besides grow flowers, anyway.
