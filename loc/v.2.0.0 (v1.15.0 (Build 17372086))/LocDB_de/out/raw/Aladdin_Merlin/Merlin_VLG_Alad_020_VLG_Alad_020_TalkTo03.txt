Merlin!

Have you ever enchanted a carpet to fly?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I need some magic help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you busy?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Have I? No, now that you mention it, I haven't. Though I have enchanted the odd broomstick. However, I tend not to use such things when I travel. Why do you ask?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Aladdin and I want to make a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Magic Carpet</ActivityItem> for me to glide around the Valley on.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
What a delightful prospect, albeit one I know very little about.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Though I daresay the wizards of Agrabah have it all figured out; racing over dunes and through oases must be very comfortable on a carpet.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
So you don't have any ideas?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I can't believe I finally stumped you.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Oh, I have 28 and a half ideas, but we can start with my favorite one: books.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
I believe there are several books in the <Lore>Dreamlight Library</Lore> that you will find useful in this endeavor.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Specifically, I would search for books on <Lore>Fabric Enchantment, Carpet Weaving,</Lore> and <Lore>Flying Technique</Lore>.

Stumped! Ha-ha-ha, we are not stumped yet, {PlayerName}! We've only just begun!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
As always, my friend, I am here to guide you to the best of my ability. What can I assist you with?

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Am Iâ

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Am I busy?!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
My friend, I am busy researching multiple subjects of the past, present, and the future at all times!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
However... I am NEVER too busy for you. What can I assist you with?
