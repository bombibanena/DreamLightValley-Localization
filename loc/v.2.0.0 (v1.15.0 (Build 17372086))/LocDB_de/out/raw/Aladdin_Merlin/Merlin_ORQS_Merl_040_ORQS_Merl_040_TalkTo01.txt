Hey Merlin? I found a strange object in the Valley and it made things go... wrong.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I used to play with it outside with my friends.

TAG: Player_004_f
When I picked it up, it felt exactly like...

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
...the last time I ever played outside.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
...playing the make-believe games I never wanted to end.

TAG: Player_004_choice_003_f
...drifting apart from childhood best friends.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
It's a diary Jasmine and I found. I wrote it when I was younger but... I don't remember doing that at all.

TAG: Player_000_f
When I held it in my hands...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...I just wanted to be FREE to live my life!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...I remembered feeling like no one understood me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
...I felt like a lonely teenager.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I see... What a peculiar response... And you have NO memory of this object?

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
No, but the feelings it brought up were STRONG.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
I don't think so...

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
Is this a bad practical joke?

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Strong and perhaps a little turbulent by the sounds of it...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
I believe what you've found is a magical <Lore>Memento</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
They're created when someone takes an experience â perhaps a complicated or even unpleasant one â and seals it away, where it can no longer reach them.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
And I believe, in this instance, that someone was YOU.

TAG: Player_008_f
I made this "Memento" thing?

TAG: Player_008_choice_000_f
What does that mean?

TAG: Player_008_choice_001_f
Why don't I remember doing this?

TAG: Player_008_choice_002_f
How dare it make me feel my FEELINGS!

TAG: Merlin_016_f
It means that before the Forgetting, you used your magic to get rid of an emotional memory.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
The experience contained within the Memento is starting to push back and escape the object. Hence the, uh... odd magical chaos.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Feelings, after all, do not like to be denied or pushed away. They always return, often stronger, until they are dealt with. These feelings must be embraced and understood.

TAG: Player_009_choice_000_f
OK... What's next?

TAG: Player_009_choice_001_f
I don't like the sound of this...

TAG: Player_009_choice_002_f
But it's over now, right?

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Well, I would imagine the object you mentioned is <Lore>not the only one of its kind hidden in the Valley</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
We should keep our eyes and ears open for <Lore>more Mementos</Lore> and for the problems they will most certainly cause.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
<Lore>Only you can face the feeling stored inside</Lore> and set things right again.

TAG: Player_003_f
Face emotions that pre-Forgetting me magically sealed away...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Just another day in the Valley, huh?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
This sounds pretty daunting.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I'm going to craft a box of tissues, ASAP.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Yes, I suppose you're right. But don't forget: You've become quite capable of pushing back mayhem with your Dreamlight Magic. And, well...

TAG: Merlin_025_f
I believe I can speak for the entire Village when I say we are here to help you weather these storms... whatever form they may take.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
Now then, be sure to <Lore>store the Mementos you find somewhere safe</Lore>. I'm certain they will lead back to something... or someone... who was quite important to you at the time you created them.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Take heart, {PlayerName}. Whatever is ahead, know that you are dearly loved.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Ah...

TAG: Merlin_026_f
I handled the problem... so we're good?

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Ah...

TAG: Merlin_017_f
We can assume that you did it before the Forgetting, and thus, long ago.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
You used your magic to rid yourself of something difficult. Something you wanted to push away.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
A beautiful, though occasionally challenging, necessity of the human condition, I'm afraid.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Hmm... How curious.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
I'm afraid not, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
It's some sort of magical kaleidoscope... And it's started to warp everything in the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_f
When I picked it up it felt like...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...I was being told I was weird.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...I'd never find a place to fit in.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...Someone was laughing at my ideas.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
It's something that was important to me when I was really young.

TAG: Player_002_f
When I picked it up, I remembered I gave it up too soon because...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...I was embarrassed that no one else needed comfort.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...I wanted to prove how grown-up I was.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...Someone made fun of me for liking it.
