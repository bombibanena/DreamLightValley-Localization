Is it true? Am I really human again...?

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
I am! And it's all thanks to you! I don't know how I'll ever repay you.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
Oh, and... heh-heh, just so you know, I was conscious the whole time, bumping around inside your pack. You should really clean that thing out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Yeah, I know.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Maybe later.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
But I never know what I'll need!

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
Wait a second... where's Ariel?! Is she okay? What did Ursula do to her?

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
Ursula sent her to a deserted island. But she's safe now. She helped me rescue you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She'll be happy to see you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
But let's hear more about your story.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She's pretty mad at Ursula...

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
I've got to see her right away. Whoa...

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
Wow... I'm so famished I can barely walk. I can't face her like this... not after everything... I have to get my strength back first.

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
No problem. I'll whip up a dish for you that's fit for a prince. How does <ActivityItem>Gazpacho</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Vegetable Stew</ActivityItem>, and a fresh <ActivityItem>Berry Salad</ActivityItem> sound?

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
That sounds incredible!

TAG: PrinceEric_012_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
I'll tell you everything. But not right now. I need to see Ariel... Whoa...

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
So am I.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
I have to go see Ariel right away... Whoa...
