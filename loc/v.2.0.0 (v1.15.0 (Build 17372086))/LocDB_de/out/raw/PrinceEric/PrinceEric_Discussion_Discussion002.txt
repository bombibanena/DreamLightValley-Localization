I love Dazzle Beach. The salty sea air. The wind blowing in your face! There's nothing like it.

I love the ocean.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I get seasick.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
You do? We're pretty similar then. What's your favorite thing about the sea?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The waves.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The salty air.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The mermaids!

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
I understand that. I love crashing over the waves, as long as they aren't crashing over the ship!

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
Yes! There's something about the air near the ocean. It smells so fresh and alive.

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
Not everyone believes in them, but you and I know they're real. And one of them, at least, is pretty amazing.

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
Oh, I'm sorry about that. I don't get seasick myself, but I have a friend who does.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
I know it's pretty unpleasant. Well, I hope you can enjoy the ocean from the shore.
