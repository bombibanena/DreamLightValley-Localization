There's an old sailors' legend that seeing a dolphin means good fortune for a journey.

Are there a lot of dolphins around the Valley?

I didn't know that.

I love dolphins!

A few. Sometimes I see them while I'm fishing.

Well, all the crews I've sailed with believe it. I like to think it's true.

I do too. Seeing them is always really impressive.

Oh, I hope you do someday. They're amazing. And good luck!
