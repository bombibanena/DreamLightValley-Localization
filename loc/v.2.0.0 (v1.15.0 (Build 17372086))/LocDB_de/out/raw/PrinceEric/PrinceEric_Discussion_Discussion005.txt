Hey, {PlayerName}, I really love the fishing expeditions I've taken. I get to explore all the waters around the Valley.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
I haven't found many other islands yet, but I've seen a lot of reefs and strange fish.

What do you need to go exploring?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is there anything special out there?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is it safe?

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
Just a ship and a fair wind.

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
A map can be handy, but sometimes it's more fun to chart your own way.

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
Well, I won't know unless I look!

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
That's part of what makes it exciting. Not knowing what I'll find.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
Well, I can't be completely sure. And that's part of the fun! Adventure is never guaranteed to be safe.

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
Ships are safe in the harbor, but that's not what ships are built for.

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
They're meant to sail out and explore.
