There's this old riddle we used to ask new sailors on our ship. Would you like to hear it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
Okay, here you go: What do you throw out to use and take back to stop?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Trash.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
An anchor.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
A net.

Huh? That's an interesting answer. It's not the one the old sea dogs taught me, though.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
Yes! That's the answer. Pretty clever, huh?

TAG: PrinceEric_002_f
Guess you're not a riddle sort of a person. That's okay.
