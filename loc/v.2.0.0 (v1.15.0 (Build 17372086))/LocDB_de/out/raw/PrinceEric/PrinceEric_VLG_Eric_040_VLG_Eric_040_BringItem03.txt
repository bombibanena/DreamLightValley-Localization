With this, I can find the ruins. Of course, I still need a way to dive under the ocean for long enough to look around.

I LOVE diving.

Careful. Diving can be dangerous.

Diving is my worst nightmare.

What about a <ActivityItem>Diving Suit</ActivityItem>? That would do the trick. I bet Mr. McDuck would know how to make one.

Okay, I got some schematics for a diving suit from Scrooge McDuck.

We'll need <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Gold Ingots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>. If you can find all that, I'll study the plans.

Well sure, but everything at sea can be dangerous if you're not careful.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
Don't worry. I'll take care of that part.
