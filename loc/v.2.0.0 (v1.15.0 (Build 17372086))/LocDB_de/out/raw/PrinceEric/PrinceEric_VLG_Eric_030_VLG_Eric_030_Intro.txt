Hey {PlayerName}, do you have time to talk? I have something to ask you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Of course. How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Not right now...

TAG: PrinceEric_000_f
Would you say you yearn for adventure?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Definitely!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This is the important question you wanted to ask?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not really. I'd prefer to take a nap.

TAG: PrinceEric_004_f
I knew it! I bet it's why we get along so well. Anyway...

TAG: PrinceEric_007_f
Before the Forgetting, I used to sail the seas around the Valley. It was great. The salty sea air. The wind blowing in your face.

TAG: PrinceEric_011_f
Sometimes, I'd even discover Valley artifacts and bring them back for archiving.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
You need to start sailing again!

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
You must miss it very much.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
Okay, get to the point. What do you need?

TAG: PrinceEric_008_f
I'd love to! But I can't go back unprepared. I need some help with my maps.

TAG: PrinceEric_015_f
There's something funny about the ocean now. It seems to change all the time.

TAG: Player_001_f
I'll go ask Scrooge McDuck. After all...

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
...he's an adventurer himself.

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
...he'd never say no to a business opportunity.

TAG: Player_000_choice_011_f
...I won't give him a choice.

TAG: PrinceEric_001_f
Yeah, he does love treasure hunting.

TAG: PrinceEric_014_f
Could you ask him for any maps he has of the seas around the Valley? He'll know what we need.

TAG: PrinceEric_012_f
Yeah, you can always count on his interest in making money.

TAG: PrinceEric_013_f
Whoa, whoa! You should totally be nice.

TAG: PrinceEric_009_f
I do. I want to sail again, but first I need some updated maps...

TAG: PrinceEric_010_f
I need maps. Mine date back to before the Forgetting, and they aren't accurate.

TAG: PrinceEric_005_f
No. Sorry. I'll get to my real question.

TAG: PrinceEric_006_f
Really? Wow. That's funny, because adventure seems to find you. Anyway...

TAG: PrinceEric_003_f
I understand. Let me know when you have some time.
