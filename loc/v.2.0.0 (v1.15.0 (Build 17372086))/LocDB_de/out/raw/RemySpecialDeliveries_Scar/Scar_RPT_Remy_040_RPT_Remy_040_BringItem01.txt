Oh goody... My food has arrived at last.

TAG: Scar_001_f
I assume it's no longer fresh, considering how long it took you to bring it to me. The service here is simply wretched...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's still fresh and delicious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why don't you try it before you judge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Soooo does that mean you won't be tipping?

TAG: Scar_002_f
Hmm... It does smell... acceptable.

TAG: Scar_007_f
*sigh* Why are you still here? You've brought me my food. Leave.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Aren't you going to give me a tip?

TAG: Scar_009_f
A "tip"? What on earth is that?

TAG: Scar_005_f
When someone delivers you food, you're supposed to give them a little extra something to thank them.

TAG: Scar_006_f
How ridiculous. Where I come from, we pay tribute to kings, not to the hyenas who fetch things for us.

TAG: Scar_010_f
But I suppose if it's customary, I'll have to play by your rules... for now.

TAG: Scar_011_f
Here. Take this sack of worthless trinkets I found lying about.

"Tipping"? What on earth is that?
