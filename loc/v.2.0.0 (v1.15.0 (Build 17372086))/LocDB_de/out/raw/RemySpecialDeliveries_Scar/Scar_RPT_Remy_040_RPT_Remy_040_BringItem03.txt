Ah, yes, these will do nicely. He'll have no idea of the trap I've laid...

TAG: Scar_001_f
Er, I mean... thank you, {PlayerName}. I look forward to feasting on these... delicacies... myself... at a later time.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Enjoy!

TAG: Scar_003_f
Oh, {PlayerName}, you'd be surprised at the things I'll eat when I'm this famished. Heh-heh-heh.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Scheme? How dare you, {PlayerName}. Take it from me: You won't get far in this world insulting those you serve.
