Hey, Scar! Can we go to your House?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Someone wants to talk to you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We can have a nice walk together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
For... reasons...?

TAG: Scar_003_f
Someone? Whose name you can't tell me.

TAG: Scar_005_f
And you're serving as their messenger? How sad.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Regardless... This could be mildly amusing.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Oh, DO tell me this is a setup for one of your sad little surprises, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scar_007_f
I suppose I was growing bored of being left COMPLETELY alone. *sigh* Well, let's get this over with.

TAG: Scar_004_f
You smell like the small, red dragon. I imagine he has something to do with this.

TAG: Scar_008_f
I will join you... Not because you were even remotely convincing...

TAG: Scar_009_f
...but because I'm bored, and I've been meaning to show Mushu who the true leader of the pride is around here...
