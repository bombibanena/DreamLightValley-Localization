Hiya, Donald! Do you have any Valley food memories to share? I'm putting together a spread for a theme party with Sally and the Fairy Godmother.

Umm... Oh, I know! Remember that time Kristoff got stuck in the Dark Portal? And I was there to help him out, but I didn't need help at all?

And the two of us went fishing?

You were STUCK in the portal too...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yep, it's ringing a bell!

TAG: Donald_005_f
Don't be ridiculous. I wasn't stuck! Anyway...

I made a fantastic <ActivityItem>Fish Salad</ActivityItem> with that fish we caught. It was delicious!

Hmm... Okay. Thanks for sharing, Donald.
