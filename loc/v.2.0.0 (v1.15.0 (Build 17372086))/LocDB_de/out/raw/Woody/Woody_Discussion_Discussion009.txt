What role do you think you'd be best at?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Heroic ranger.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Diabolical villain.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Cactus.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Good choice. And if you're lookin' for somebody to play the sheriff to your deputy...

TAG: Woody_005_f
...well, nobody's better at that than me.

TAG: Woody_003_f
So you like kidnapping folks and twirlin' your moustache, huh?

TAG: Woody_007_f
That's great. Playtime's nothing without a good villain.

TAG: Woody_004_f
Huh. Okay. Setting the scene. Well, that's important.
