Hey now! I remember! This Carousel used to be one of the nicest places in the Village.

If anyone was feelin' sad, they could always look at the lights, and they'd feel better. It made you feel like a kid again, just for a few minutes.

This is it, {PlayerName}! This is what I need to do.

TAG: Woody_006_f
I'll restore the Carousel, and that'll help everyone in the Valley.

Gotta say, it sure is nice to have a purpose around here.

TAG: Player_000_f
You don't need to have a purpose you know...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We love your company.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Just being here is enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Embrace being useless!

TAG: Woody_002_f
Aw, thanks. Folks are real friendly around here.

TAG: Woody_009_f
But I'm feelin' pretty good about this idea.

TAG: Woody_012_f
Thanks for helpin' me find this project.

TAG: Woody_001_f
I just need some time to make a list of what needs to be fixed. I'll tell you when I'm ready to start workin' on it. This is gonna be great!

TAG: Woody_003_f
Well, that's kind of you to say.

TAG: Woody_008_f
Buzz would tell you, that's kinda impossible for me.
