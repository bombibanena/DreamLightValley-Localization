What does it mean to be a favorite toy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We'd need a kid to have a favorite toy.

Well, when you're a kid's favorite toy, you have responsibilities. You've gotta take care of the other toys. Make sure they're safe.

Keep things organized. And whatever you do, make sure no one gets lost!

Oh, right! Heh-heh. Gotta say, it's a bit strange bein' part of a community that's not organized around kids.
