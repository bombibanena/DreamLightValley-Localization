Hey, {PlayerName}, I was thinkin' maybe you and I are overdue for some playtime.

TAG: Woody_001_f
What do ya say? I'll be the sheriff and you be the bank robber hidin' out at the old stables.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure. Let's play.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Oh, oh, this is gonna be great!

TAG: Woody_004_f
Ahem... <Lore>"This town ain't big enough for the two of us, partner! It's time to surrender."</Lore>

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
"I ain't gonna turn myself over to some lily-livered coward like you!"

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
"You got the wrong person! I'm innocent, I tell ya!"

TAG: Woody_006_f
<Lore>"Looks like what we got here is a good old-fashioned standoff."</Lore>

TAG: Woody_009_f
Psst. {PlayerName}. We need a big stunt. You got any ideas?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
A daring chase!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
A jump from the hayloft!

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I get in my spaceship and fly away.

TAG: Woody_017_f
<Lore>"Where you goin'?! Get back here, you low-down, thievin' varmint!"</Lore>

TAG: Woody_015_f
Great stuff, {PlayerName}. That was really dramatic.

TAG: Woody_019_f
We gotta do this again soon.

TAG: Woody_018_f
<Lore>"Whoa! You landed right on the back of a horse! Get back here, you thievin' varmint!"</Lore>

TAG: Woody_010_f
<Lore>"Gah! Ya got me!"</Lore>

TAG: Woody_007_f
<Lore>"Innocent? Aw, that's what they all say."</Lore>

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
"You got me. But I'll never surrender!"

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
"No really! I've been framed! I swear it! Honest!"

TAG: Woody_008_f
<Lore>"Well, if ya say you're honest, I reckon you must be."</Lore>

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
"Ha! I tricked you into letting your guard down!"

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
"Make me your deputy, and I'll help you solve this crime."

TAG: Woody_011_f
No, no, no, no... Time out!

TAG: Woody_012_f
Now we've got two heroes and no villain.

TAG: Woody_013_f
I think we'll have to postpone till we find somebody else to play the villain.

TAG: Woody_014_f
Merlin or Goofy could be fun...

TAG: Woody_003_f
Sure, {PlayerName}. We'll just reschedule.

TAG: Woody_020_f
Wait, wait, wait... Time out...

TAG: Woody_021_f
Spaceships are really Buzz's territory.

TAG: Woody_005_f
Maybe we should reschedule and invite him if we wanna include space stuff.
