Howdy, partner. You must be {PlayerName}.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Guess I've got you to thank for helping Buzz unlock the window.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Whatever it takes to help a toy in need.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Ah, don't worry. It was nothing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You owe me. Big time.

TAG: Woody_003_f
And I certainly appreciate it.

TAG: Woody_006_f
Buzz said you got knocked out the window on some kind of mission. What were you doing?

TAG: Woody_007_f
Well, Bonnie's family's off on a vacation, and she left us behind to take care of something for her.

TAG: Woody_008_f
She wants to put on a play when she gets back.

TAG: Woody_009_f
A play? What sort of play?

TAG: Woody_010_f
With Bonnie's imagination, you never know. But she made a little farm out of pipe cleaners and ice pop sticks...

TAG: Woody_011_f
...and then she made a whole bunch of animals for it out of construction paper.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's so cute!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's so creative!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That sounds like a lot of work.

TAG: Woody_012_f
That's our Bonnie.

TAG: Woody_014_f
She's a real creative kid.

TAG: Woody_015_f
But wait... Where's the farm?

TAG: Woody_016_f
Heh-heh... Well... uh... Bonnie's farm got... knocked over. And it broke. Pieces of it scattered all over the room.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Oh no! That's awful.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Wait a second... Did you knock it over?

TAG: Woody_025_f
Yep, it just about broke my heart seein' it all in pieces.

TAG: Woody_017_f
So Buzz and I decided we're gonna rebuild Bonnie's farm, just how she left it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I want to help.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You're a good toy, Woody.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Seems like your plan isn't going too well...

TAG: Woody_019_f
That's great! Because we could really use some help right about now.

TAG: Woody_000_f
Um... I think I might have some leaves stuck under my hat.

TAG: Woody_023_f
Why don't you talk to Buzz and he'll brief you on the rest of the plan.

TAG: Woody_018_f
Any kid would be lucky to have you.

TAG: Woody_020_f
Aw, shucks. Thanks. I just wanna make sure everything's perfect when Bonnie gets back.

TAG: Woody_021_f
You're right. You're right.

TAG: Woody_022_f
But now, we've got a chance to fix our mistakes.

TAG: Woody_026_f
What? No!

TAG: Woody_027_f
... Buzz knocked it over when his wings popped out.

TAG: Woody_028_f
And sure... maybe I happened to bump into him and accidentally pushed his wing button, but...

TAG: Woody_029_f
But that doesn't matter now! What matters is, Buzz and I decided to rebuild Bonnie's farm, just how she left it.

TAG: Woody_013_f
Yeah, but Bonnie loves arts and crafts.

TAG: Woody_004_f
Hey, now. Don't sell yourself short. That was a great rescue plan you and Buzz pulled off.

TAG: Woody_005_f
Heh-heh. Okay... Don't worry. You've got a friend in me for life now.
