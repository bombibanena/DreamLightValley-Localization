Well, look at you!

TAG: Woody_006_f
That's about the quickest growth spurt I've ever seen.

TAG: Woody_007_f
I guess this place is just as magical as you said.

TAG: Woody_008_f
Huh. Y'know, it's funny. Now that I'm seein' you so much bigger...

TAG: Woody_018_f
Y'know, I've never gotten to come right out and say that to anyone before.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Thank you for being my toy, Woody.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
You're my favorite deputy.

TAG: Woody_009_f
...you look kinda familiar to me, partner.

TAG: Woody_010_f
This isn't the first time you've been to Dreamlight Valley...

TAG: Woody_011_f
...or the first time we've met!

TAG: Woody_012_f
Everything's a bit foggy, but... I spent a lot of time here, didn't I? A long time ago. Before... before...

TAG: Woody_019_f
...before the Forgetting. Don't worry. All your memories should come back in time.

TAG: Woody_013_f
And you... well, you were just a kid back then, weren't you?

TAG: Woody_014_f
I guess you're all grown up now, huh?

TAG: Woody_017_f
Well, thanks for bein' such a great kid.

TAG: Woody_020_f
Hey now, I was just doin' my job.

TAG: Woody_023_f
Well, I guess I oughta explore a bit. See if I can help folks out while I'm here.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
There's a lot to do around here.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I can use all the help I can get.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You can just relax, you know.

TAG: Woody_026_f
I bet there is.

TAG: Woody_029_f
Say, maybe I could organize a Buddy System to make sure nobody gets lost...

TAG: Woody_030_f
Or hold a Plastic Corrosion Awareness meeting...

TAG: Woody_004_f
And I bet a few folks could use reminders about the dangers of vents and grates.

TAG: Woody_031_f
Y'know, I think I'm gonna like this place.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Suppose this must be what it feels like when someone finds a bunch of their old favorite toys in the attic.

TAG: Woody_027_f
Well, you can count on me, partner!

TAG: Woody_028_f
Heh-heh. Yeah, well, if you ask Buzz, that's not really my strong suit.

TAG: Woody_022_f
Heh-heh. And you're mine, partner.

TAG: Woody_015_f
It's funny. This place sure does look familiar.

TAG: Woody_016_f
This isn't the first time you've been to Dreamlight Valley...

TAG: Woody_021_f
Everything's a bit foggy, but... I spent a lot of time here, didn't I? A long time ago. Before... before...

TAG: Woody_024_f
...before the Forgetting. Don't worry. All your memories should come back in time.
