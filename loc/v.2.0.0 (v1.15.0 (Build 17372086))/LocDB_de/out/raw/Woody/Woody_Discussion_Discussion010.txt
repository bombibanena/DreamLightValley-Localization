Say, {PlayerName}, have ya ever been to a rodeo?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why do you ask?

TAG: Woody_002_f
They're fun, aren't they?

TAG: Woody_005_f
All that riding, and lassoing, and sheep wrangling...

TAG: Woody_006_f
And then at the end, you've gotta save the whole rodeo from a giant pig named Dr. Porkchop.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Cool.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Wait, are you talking about real rodeos or pretend rodeos?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Um... giant pig?

TAG: Woody_007_f
Yep, there's nothin' like a good old-fashioned rodeo. We ought to have one here in the Valley sometime.

TAG: Woody_008_f
Well, I'm a toy, so I've only been to pretend rodeos.

TAG: Woody_009_f
But they can't be that different, can they?

TAG: Woody_010_f
They don't have that tradition at real rodeos?

TAG: Woody_011_f
It was very popular at the rodeos in Andy's room.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Oh, you're missin' out! They're loads of fun.

TAG: Woody_004_f
I'm just thinkin' about how much fun rodeos can be.
