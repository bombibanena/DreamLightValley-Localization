Y'know, I've been thinkin' about it, and I've decided I'm gonna learn how to sew.

It's a useful skill.

Can I help?

TAG: Woody_001_f
You bet. Especially if you're made of cloth.

Exactly. If I rip a seam, I can just patch it up myself.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}, but I think I'm gonna try to teach myself.

There's gotta be a book in Merlin's library that can show me how to do it.
