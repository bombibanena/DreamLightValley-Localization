Thanks for helping me clean that up, {PlayerName}.

Though, somethin's still not right... *gasp* The Aliens! I could swear there were more of them in here.

TAG: Woody_001_f
I bet the explosion scared 'em, and now they're somewhere out there in the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We need to find them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Where do you think they went?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm sure they're fine.

TAG: Woody_008_f
You're right. But I'll try looking for 'em on my own first. They know me, so I should be able to coax 'em out of hiding.

TAG: Woody_010_f
Thanks for your help, {PlayerName}. I'll let ya know if I need a hand finding our little green friends.

TAG: Woody_009_f
I don't know, but I can't let a fellow toy stay lost. I'll track 'em down.

TAG: Woody_007_f
Maybe, but I can't let a fellow toy stay lost out there. I'll start lookin' around.
