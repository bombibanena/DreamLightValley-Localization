What did Remy say?

TAG: Player_000_f
He had me do a little taste test on the meals you cooked.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
[LIE] They weren't that bad!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How could you not realize they tasted like that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's so bad it's amazing.

TAG: Woody_004_f
Thanks partner, but you don't have to lie to make me feel better. I could tell they were pretty horrible.

TAG: Woody_008_f
Cooking for toys is pretty simple. Everything's made of plastic. And if it looks good, it's good.

TAG: Woody_007_f
But the meals didn't look good either...

TAG: Woody_009_f
But they did look fun! So I was hopin' they'd be fun to eat.

TAG: Woody_001_f
Hey, you can't blame me. I'm a toy! I haven't got any taste buds! I can't tell if it's bad.

TAG: Woody_000_f
Let me show you how it's done. Then you'll be such a good cook, you won't even need to taste the dishes.

TAG: Woody_010_f
That would be great! Then we can give whatever we cook together to Remy to help him out. He's still got a lot of orders to fill.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Here, these were the <ActivityItem>Recipes</ActivityItem> he asked me to prepare.

TAG: Woody_005_f
Because I couldn't taste it.

TAG: Woody_006_f
Oh yeah, laugh it up. At least I managed to entertain you.
