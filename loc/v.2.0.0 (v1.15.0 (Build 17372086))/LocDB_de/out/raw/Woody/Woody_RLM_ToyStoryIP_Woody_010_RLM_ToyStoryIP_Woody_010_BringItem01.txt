This looks great. Thanks for wrangling all that.

But we're still gonna need a couple more things to rebuild Bonnie's farm.

TAG: Woody_005_f
What will we need?

TAG: Woody_000_f
Well, Bonnie drew these giant <ActivityItem>Yellow Daisies</ActivityItem> above the farm.

TAG: Woody_002_f
Just leave those to me. I'll <Lore>find Yellow Daisies in my Village</Lore>.

TAG: Woody_001_f
Sounds good, partner! Oh, but we'll also need something to hold it all together...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Chewing gum?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
String?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Glue?

TAG: Woody_006_f
That could work. But Bonnie doesn't chew gum, so I doubt we'd find any.

TAG: Woody_009_f
Hold on, didn't you say you sent Buzz on a recon mission?

TAG: Woody_010_f
Maybe he's found something we can use.

TAG: Woody_011_f
Good idea! I'll go <Lore>talk to Buzz in my Village</Lore>.

TAG: Woody_012_f
Okay. Then bring everything back to me, and I'll start putting it together.

TAG: Woody_007_f
I'm afraid the only string around here is my pull string, and I'm kinda attached to it. Heh-heh.

TAG: Woody_008_f
I'm afraid the only glue around here is preschool safe. It's not gonna be strong enough.
