Thanks for all your help, {PlayerName}.

Now that we don't need it anymore, you can keep the <ActivityItem>Blanket Fort</ActivityItem> and put it wherever you like.

Ya know, this all started because I wanted to make myself useful around the Village.

You're pretty wise, {PlayerName}. Having you here is like having an inner voice that helps me see the big picture.

That's why I wanted you to have this. A <ActivityItem>Pull-String</ActivityItem> just like mine, to symbolize our friendship.
