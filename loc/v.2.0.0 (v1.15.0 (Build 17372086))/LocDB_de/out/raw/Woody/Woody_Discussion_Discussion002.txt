Say, {PlayerName}, I was tryin' to talk to that funny little fella, WALLÂ·E, but he just kept sayin' the same few words and makin' sounds. Do ya know if he's a toy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He's a toy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's a robot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's a friend.

TAG: Woody_001_f
I knew it! Seems like he could use somebody to show him the ropes around here.

TAG: Woody_004_f
I'll spend some time with him.

TAG: Woody_002_f
A non-toy robot, you mean?

TAG: Woody_005_f
Well, I guess that explains why he's so comfortable moving around when everyone's looking.

TAG: Woody_006_f
I know the rules are different here, but it still takes a little gettin' used to.

TAG: Woody_003_f
Well, he sure looks like it.

TAG: Woody_007_f
With those round black eyes and cute little beeps, he kinda reminds me of a toy race car I used to know.
