Hey Mr. McDuck, I've got a bit of a favor to ask you.

Well, if you want to do this right, I'd suggest crafting some <ActivityItem>Bamboo Benches</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Attorney Stands</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Crafting them will require <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Brass Ingots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Plastic Scraps</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Bamboo</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Fiber</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
I need someone to act as prosecuting attorney. Would you be interested?

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Bless me bagpipes! You bet I would!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
I'll even help ya with the furnishings. You'll want some official-looking benches and stands for the whole affair, I imagine?

Yes, actually! That's the next thing on my to-do list.
