Here's the chest that appeared. The more I look at it, the more I remember...

TAG: Elsa_001_f
Merlin and I used our magic to keep something safe for you at Jasmine's request.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
The <ActivityItem>Ice Key</ActivityItem>! I'm sure that's it!

TAG: Elsa_013_f
I think you may be right, {PlayerName}. Unfortunately, the ice surrounding the chest seems to be unbreakable.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How do we break UNBREAKABLE ice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sure there's something we can do...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Well. We're doomed.

TAG: Elsa_017_f
With a little magic, perhaps?

TAG: Elsa_014_f
I suspect the solution will be found in those two pedestals by the chest.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
There are symbols engraved on them: a sun and a snowflake. That has to mean something.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Have you seen this sort of magic before?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Those symbols may be pointing us towards somewhere sunny and somewhere snowy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Do you remember ANYTHING else?

TAG: Elsa_018_f
I think so. It feels... familiar to me.

TAG: Elsa_023_f
I... I think the symbols are telling us where to go.

TAG: Elsa_024_f
Maybe the Sunlit Plateau and the Frosted Heights?

TAG: Elsa_021_f
Wait... Something's coming back to me!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I knew you'd remember something!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
So you know EXACTLY what to do now, right?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
YES!

TAG: Elsa_025_f
Those symbols ARE <Lore>hidden around the Sunlit Plateau and the Frosted Heights</Lore>. They're connected to the pedestals with Merlin's magic.

TAG: Elsa_026_f
If you find all the symbols, the ice surrounding the chest should melt away, freeing whatever's inside.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
Brilliant! Thank you, Elsa! First things first, I'll <Lore>take a picture of the pedestals here</Lore> to use as a reference.

TAG: Elsa_030_f
Then I can <Lore>take pictures of the Pedestal Symbols around the Frosted Heights and the Sunlit Plateau</Lore>. I'll come back here when I'm done to see if the magic worked.

TAG: Elsa_019_f
That actually sounds familiar...

TAG: Elsa_020_f
I... I think the symbols are telling us where to go.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
You're right, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.
