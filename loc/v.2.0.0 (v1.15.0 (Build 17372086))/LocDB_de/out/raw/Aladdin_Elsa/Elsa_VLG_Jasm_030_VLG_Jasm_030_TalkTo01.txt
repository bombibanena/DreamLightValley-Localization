Hi, Elsa! Jasmine and I are on a mission to find a missing key to open an old journal of mine. We think it's somewhere in the Frosted Heights.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
Well, {PlayerName}, I was just about to come find you. Some odd, unbreakable ice surrounding a chest suddenly appeared in my Ice Cavern.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's too much of a coincidence to not mean anything.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hmm... I wonder if that has to do with my journal?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's... random.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
You think the unbreakable ice is connected to the missing key?

TAG: Elsa_002_f
Well... the first key for the journal was difficult to retrieve. I think I wanted to keep whatever is in my <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem> very safe.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
Before the Forgetting, someone must have asked for your help to keep this other key safe, too.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
And you think the missing key is in the chest. I understand.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Exactly! <Lore>Let's go to your Ice Cavern and see if we can find a way to break the unbreakable ice</Lore>.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
It's the only way we'll know for sure.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Why do you think that?

TAG: Elsa_005_f
It certainly surprised me.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
I wonder if it has anything to do with the key I'm looking for?
