Oh, thank you so much, {PlayerName}! I didn't want any of that chocolate going to waste, but I couldn't eat another bite.

TAG: Anna_000_f
Eating chocolate to help a friend isn't such a bad way to spend my time.

TAG: Anna_001_f
Before you go, there's something else I wanted to mention.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm listening.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh no, what now?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is there more chocolate?

TAG: Anna_006_f
I can't really explain this, but maybe you'll know what to do...

TAG: Anna_002_f
Okay, so earlier today, even though I was completely freaked out about my chocolate dilemma, there WAS one person who could cheer me up.

TAG: Anna_009_f
Oh really? Who?

TAG: Anna_010_f
... Mike Wazowski.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
He IS pretty funny!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's a little random.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Why is that so strange?

TAG: Anna_011_f
He is, but the weird part is he was making me laugh even without telling jokes!

TAG: Anna_014_f
This definitely sounds like more wish magic causing havoc. I'll go <Lore>talk to Mike</Lore> and see what he wished for exactly.

TAG: Anna_012_f
It's VERY random! Especially since he was making me laugh without even telling any jokes!

TAG: Anna_013_f
Well, he was making me laugh without telling any jokes.

TAG: Anna_007_f
I'm not sure I have room for any more food-related emergencies.

TAG: Anna_008_f
Don't worry; it's nothing like that.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Or perhaps a different food-related issue? Do you have an abundance of sandwiches I could help you with?

TAG: Anna_005_f
No, nothing like that!
