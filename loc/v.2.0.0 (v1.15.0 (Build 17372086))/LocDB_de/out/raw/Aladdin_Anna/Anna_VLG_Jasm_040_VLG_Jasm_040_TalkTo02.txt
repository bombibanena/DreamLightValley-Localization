Oh {PlayerName}, I'm so glad you're here! I could really use some help.

TAG: Anna_001_f
What happened?

TAG: Anna_002_f
I don't know... One second, I'm wishing I could eat chocolate every day, and the next... well...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
All of your stuff turned into chocolate?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You discovered you have powers like Elsa, but with CHOCOLATE?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Nothing happened and everything is fine?

TAG: Anna_003_f
Not exactly, though you aren't far off.

TAG: Anna_006_f
Suddenly, everything I touch turns to chocolate!

TAG: Anna_007_f
It's so weird! I wish for chocolate at LEAST once a day. But this time, something actually happened!

TAG: Anna_008_f
I know what happened. There's some wish magic loose in the Valley. I haven't quite gotten to the bottom of it yet, but I'm working on it.

TAG: Anna_009_f
Wish magic? That sounds like it could get dangerous.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Jasmine is looking into it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I won't let anything bad happen.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's what I'm worried about!

TAG: Anna_010_f
She'll let me know if anything bad can come of this.

TAG: Anna_013_f
But first things first, I'd like to help you with all of this chocolate in your House.

TAG: Anna_014_f
PLEASE! I can't eat any more chocolate today. I love it, but it's just not practical.

TAG: Anna_015_f
It's a delicious problem, but a problem nonetheless. I'll just go ahead and <Lore>pick up all the chocolate</Lore> for you!

TAG: Anna_011_f
Jasmine and I are working on getting to the bottom of this.

TAG: Anna_012_f
Jasmine and I are working hard to get to the bottom of this before anything bad can happen.

TAG: Anna_004_f
Kind of, actually.

TAG: Anna_005_f
Oh, if only!
