"It's laughter we're after." One of our new guys came up with it. What do you think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's perfect!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It could use some work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I have a suggestion.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Right? Short and snappy!

And it reflects our new phi-laugh-sophy!

Sorry, sorry. Mike came up with that pun. Thought I'd try it out.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Really? You got any ideas?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Laugh power every hour!

TAG: Sully_006_f

TAG: Sully_007_f
Thanks for the brainstorming session!

TAG: Sully_008_f
Ha! That's a good rhyme. I'll give it some thought.

TAG: Sully_009_f
Huh! Not bad! I'll give it some thought.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Yeah? Hit me.
