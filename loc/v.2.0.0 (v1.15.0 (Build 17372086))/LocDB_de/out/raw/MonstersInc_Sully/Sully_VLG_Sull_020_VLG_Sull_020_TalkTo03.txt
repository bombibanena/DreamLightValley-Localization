So... How did Mike react to the news that he didn't win?

TAG: Sully_012_f
Honestly? It only motivated him to work twice as hard next month.

TAG: Sully_013_f
Phew, that's a relief.

TAG: Sully_000_f
Thanks again for telling him. Oh, and I have a surprise for you...

TAG: Sully_002_f
YOU'RE the Villager of the Month. Congratulations, pal!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This is so kind of you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
But I didn't participate...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Finally, some recognition.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Hey, it's time somebody acknowledged all the work you do for the Valley and for the good of everyone, not just your own ego.

TAG: Sully_006_f
And now for the main event...

TAG: Sully_007_f
Please place this <ActivityItem>Villager-of-the-Month Award Stand</ActivityItem> in the Valley, and we'll make it official.

TAG: Sully_004_f
A true Villager of the Month would never have just sought the award. They act for the good of the community and not for their ego.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Hey, you deserve it. After all, you act for the good of the community and not your ego.
