How did it backfire on me like that?

It was...

...sad to watch.

No kidding. I wanna teach and, ya know, connect with her. But I guess she's not that much like Boo. I'm not sure what to do.

I wanted to explore your Realm more! I'll go get it for you.

Thanks, {PlayerName}. While you do that, I'll go ask WALLÂ·E if he has any educational games in his collection that I can add to it.

I'm glad you had fun, but now I need to find a way to get through to her. I was so sure the Lemon Clock would work!
