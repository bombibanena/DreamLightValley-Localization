Hey, {PlayerName}, you're just who I was lookin' for! There's a project I wanna tell you about. Do you have a sec?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course. What is it about?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not right now.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Have I told you about Monster Movie Night? What am I sayin' â of course I haven't. I just remembered it myself!

TAG: Sully_000_f
It's pretty simple. Mike and I used to pick one of those monster movies you humans love to make, and we'd watch it with all our friends.

TAG: Player_001_f
It sounds...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...awesome!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...like it could be fun.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...too scary for me.

TAG: Sully_005_f
I'm glad you think so, because I'd really like to bring it back.

TAG: Sully_008_f
I used to rent the movies from Mr. McDuck, but when I went to the store...

TAG: Sully_009_f
There weren't any videos to rent.

TAG: Sully_010_f
What did Mr. McDuck say?

TAG: Sully_011_f
Nothing...

TAG: Sully_012_f
He was with another customer.

TAG: Sully_013_f
Mr. McDuck always looks so busy. I didn't wanna bother him.

TAG: Sully_014_f
He's never too busy when it comes to friends or business! I'll go ask him.

TAG: Sully_015_f
That would be great! Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Sully_006_f
It was. Even if the movie was bad, we always had a great time.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Aw, don't worry. Not all of 'em were scary. We watched a different genre each time: horror, comedy... even a monster romance once.

TAG: Sully_004_f
No problem. Come find me when ya have some time.
