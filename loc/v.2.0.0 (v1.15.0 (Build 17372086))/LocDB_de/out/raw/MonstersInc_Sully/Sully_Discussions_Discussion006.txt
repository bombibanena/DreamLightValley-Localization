Oh, I was just talking to Mikey about work and forgot to call the Scare Floor the Laugh Floor.

Don't wanna do that on the job. It's not a great look for the CEO.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It takes time to learn something new.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You've got to work hard at it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do you need help?

TAG: Sully_002_f
You're right. But it sure is worth doing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You don't miss the Scare Floor?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm sure you're not the only one having to adjust.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Not even a little.

TAG: Sully_004_f
Things are WAY better now for kids like Boo AND for Monstropolis.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Oh yeah, us old-timers are still catching up.

TAG: Sully_006_f
We'll get there eventually.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Oh, I do. And I'm grateful things are changing.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Nah, it's no big deal. Just need to get used to it.

TAG: Sully_009_f
But thanks for talking to me about it. I appreciate it.
