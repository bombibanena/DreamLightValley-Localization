Hey, {PlayerName}! I've been thinkin' about a pretty fun project. It would be great if you could be involved.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I can't wait to hear about your new project!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I can't, sorry.

TAG: Sully_002_f
What class are you teaching this time?

TAG: Sully_004_f
Nope. Not a class... It's a scavenger hunt! And I could really use your help organizing it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It would be my pleasure!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Does every Villager participate?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
But I wanted to participate!

TAG: Sully_005_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}! And thanks for the enthusiasm!

TAG: Sully_009_f
I thought of a few Villagers who seem like they might be... well, young at heart.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Could ya ask 'em for me while I hide the rest of the clues?

TAG: Sully_011_f
Sure! Who did you have in mind?

TAG: Sully_012_f
Stitch, Vanellope, Olaf, and Donald.

TAG: Player_002_f
Donald seems like an outlier but...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
We're all children at heart.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
He will be our control group.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
He can throw tantrums like a kid.

TAG: Sully_013_f
Yeah, that's what I thought, too.

TAG: Sully_014_f
Someone in the hunt with a short fuse could be a good thing. We'll know right away if it's too frustrating.

TAG: Sully_016_f
You can invite Donald if you like, or not. I trust your judgment.

TAG: Sully_017_f
All right, I'll go recruit our scavengers!

TAG: Sully_018_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Sully_015_f
Well, he does really want things to be fair. Anyway...

TAG: Sully_006_f
Maybe someday. But I think we gotta start small. For the first time, let's have just a few participants.

TAG: Sully_007_f
And you totally can!

TAG: Sully_008_f
The help I'm hoping for is gonna put you right in the center of the action.

TAG: Sully_003_f
No worries. Hope you'll come back when ya can.
