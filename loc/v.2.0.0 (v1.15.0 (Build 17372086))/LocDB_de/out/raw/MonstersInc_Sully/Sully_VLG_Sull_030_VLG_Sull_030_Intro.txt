{PlayerName}, just who I was lookin' for. Do you have a few minutes to talk?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What do you need?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not right now!

TAG: Sully_001_f
Well, I've been thinkin', and I wanna create a class about electricity and power.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a great idea.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Any reason why?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Easy on the experiments?

TAG: Sully_003_f
I thought you'd be on board.

TAG: Sully_004_f
I've been spendin' some time with Vanellope. Her unstoppable energy kinda reminds me of my friend Boo. Anyway, I realized she'd probably enjoy learnin' something new.

TAG: Sully_006_f
She's always talkin' about "leveling up," and I think learning is the greatest leveling up there is.

TAG: Sully_012_f
How can I help?

TAG: Sully_013_f
Could ya make a <ActivityItem>Lemon Clock</ActivityItem> while I prep for the class?

TAG: Sully_014_f
I'm guessing I'll need lemons...

TAG: Sully_015_f
Yep! You'll need <ActivityItem>Lemons</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Sully_016_f
I'll get those and craft the <ActivityItem>Lemon Clock</ActivityItem> for your project with Vanellope.

TAG: Sully_017_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. She's gonna love it.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Don't worry. I'm all about safety first.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Gotcha! Later then.
