Thanks, {PlayerName}. I don't know what I'd do without ya.

TAG: Sully_002_f
Now, I just need to insert the game I got from WALLÂ·E in the machine, press the power button and...

TAG: Sully_003_f
It doesn't work... Why doesn't it work? Did it fall over? It doesn't look like it, but it's kind of fragile.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No, but I hope I didn't break it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe it broke while in storage.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Me? Maybe it's YOU who broke it.

TAG: Sully_004_f
Oh, I'm sure it's not your fault! It's just kind of weird. Laugh energy is usually so reliable.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Laugh energy? But... Dreamlight Valley is powered by Dreamlight Magic!

TAG: Sully_008_f
Really? Wow... I guess that makes sense, but... what do we do now?

TAG: Sully_000_f
Let's update the <ActivityItem>Frightcade</ActivityItem> by converting it into a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Magic Arcade</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Sully_012_f
That would be incredible. But I gotta tell ya: I'm not a super technical guy.

TAG: Sully_009_f
Hmm... I help fix lots of things around here. I bet we could build a converter with some <ActivityItem>Gold Ingots</ActivityItem> for the circuitry and <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Sully_010_f
I'll get everything and upgrade the <ActivityItem>Frightcade Game</ActivityItem> for you.

TAG: Sully_011_f
That'd be great, {PlayerName}! Here, take the <ActivityItem>Frightcade Game</ActivityItem> back. I guess Vanellope isn't the only one learning about power today!

TAG: Sully_005_f
I hope not. It's weird that it's not working though. Laugh energy is usually pretty stable.

TAG: Sully_006_f
Hold on... Maybe it's not either of us. But it IS weird. Laugh energy is super reliable.
