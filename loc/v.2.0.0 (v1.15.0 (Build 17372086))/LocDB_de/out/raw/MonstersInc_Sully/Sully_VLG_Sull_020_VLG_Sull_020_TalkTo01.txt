Great job, {PlayerName}! The first Villager-of-the-Month contest is goin' really well.

I know exactly which project's the winner. But... Uh, before I do that, I need a small favor.

TAG: Sully_004_f
How can I help?

TAG: Sully_003_f
Well... The winner? It's not Mike.

TAG: Sully_005_f
And I'm hoping you can break the news to him... <i>gently</i>. Could you do that for me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course. You're a good friend, Sulley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Any pointers on how to tell him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is he really that sensitive?

TAG: Sully_006_f
Hey, just trying to do right by my pal. Let me give you a little advice...

TAG: Sully_007_f
...Mike can be pretty sensitive sometimes, so give him the news quietly. And then stand back. He might yell â a lot. But he'll appreciate your kindness.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Yeah, Mike can be pretty sensitive sometimes. But it's just 'cause he cares so much.
