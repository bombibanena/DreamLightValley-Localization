Well, I'm getting less exercise now that I'm not scaring anymore.

But I feel better when I'm active. So, I'm thinkin' I should take up a sport.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Baseball!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Recreational scaring!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Learn to swim!

Mike would love that. He's a HUGE fan of the Monstropolis Creepees.

I'm sure if I asked him he'd come up with a baseball workout routine for me.

And hey, maybe we could organize a league around here. I'll look into that.

Ya know, that might be fun. As long as it's sport-scaring and not real-scaring.

Pulling off a good scare can be quite a workout.

Maybe I'll visit the ol' simulator again soon.

TAG: Sully_008_f
Oh no. Pools and I don't mix.

Do you have any idea how long it takes to get that chlorine smell out of all this fur?
