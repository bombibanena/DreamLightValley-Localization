Hey, Vanellope. I've got somethin' to show ya.

TAG: Sully_009_f
Sorry, pal. But you're not making any sense.

TAG: Sully_010_f
Let me get back to you...

TAG: Sully_002_f
You do that! See ya soon, Sullster!

TAG: Sully_001_f
Behold... The wonders of electricity and power!

TAG: Sully_003_f
That's just a clock, Sulley. Oh no. Are you shedding and you inhaled too much of your own fur?

TAG: Sully_004_f
No, no. Wait for it... A clock needs power to work.

TAG: Sully_005_f
Like everything in Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Sully_006_f
And this one runs on... LEMONS!

TAG: Sully_007_f
Are you tellin' me that Dreamlight Valley runs on lemons?

TAG: Sully_008_f
No! That's not what I mean.
