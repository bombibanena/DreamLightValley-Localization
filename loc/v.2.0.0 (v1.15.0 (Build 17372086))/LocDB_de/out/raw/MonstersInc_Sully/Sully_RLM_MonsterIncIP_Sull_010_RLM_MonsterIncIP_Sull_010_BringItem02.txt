The <ActivityItem>Emergency Manual</ActivityItem>! Excellent! Let's see here...

It says that red lights mean a couple of fuses have blown and need to be replaced.

TAG: Sully_003_f
All we have to do is <Lore>replace the fuses</Lore> and <Lore>check the power lines</Lore>...

We'll save you, Mike!

... Most of those words made no sense to me.

But I'm an intern, not a mechanic!

TAG: Sully_005_f
That's right! Help is on the way!

TAG: Sully_007_f
I'll keep reading in case there's anything else we need to know. Could ya <Lore>search the Laugh Floor for some new fuses</Lore> and place 'em in the <Lore>Electrical Panel</Lore> there?

TAG: Sully_008_f
When the power's on again, <Lore>check the power lines</Lore> to make sure it's all flowing properly.

TAG: Sully_009_f
That should fix the door and get Mike home.

I'm really glad you're here, {PlayerName}. I definitely couldn't change these dainty parts with these huge paws.

I'm no technician, but I think we can do this.

Don't worry! This manual is REALLY detailed.
