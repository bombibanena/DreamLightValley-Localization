Uff! I don't smell at all right now. You got any odorant on you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's odorant?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You want to smell?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You smell fine.

TAG: Sully_001_f
Ya know, spray-on smells. My favorite is old dumpster, but I also like wet dog.

TAG: Sully_002_f
What's your favorite smell?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Lavender.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Fresh bread.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Wet dog sounds good.

TAG: Sully_003_f
Huh. A little flowery for me. But I guess it's a human thing.

TAG: Sully_004_f
Now you're just making me hungry.

TAG: Sully_005_f
The best! I'll let you borrow my odorant when I find it.

TAG: Sully_006_f
Sure! The stronger and smellier the better. Monsters like to stink it up.

TAG: Sully_007_f
Thanks. But I could smell BETTER.
