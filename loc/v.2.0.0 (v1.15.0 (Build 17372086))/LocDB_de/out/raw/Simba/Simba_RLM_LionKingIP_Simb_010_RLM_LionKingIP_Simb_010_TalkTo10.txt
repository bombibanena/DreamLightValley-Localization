Look at this place.

TAG: Simba_001_f
I think it used to be a water hole for all the animals in the jungle.

TAG: Simba_002_f
But it looks like it's been dried out for quite a while now.

TAG: Player_000_f
Hmm... it looks like it needs...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...some plants.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...some water.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...something beautiful to look at.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Yeah. Plants would bring back a lot of the smaller animals.

TAG: Simba_020_f
And there are the trees in the clearing where you found me. I bet those would have some seeds.

TAG: Simba_021_f
But you might need to do some digging to get them. Do you think your paws can do that?

TAG: Simba_022_f
Who needs paws when you've got a <Lore>Royal Shovel</Lore>? That oughta do the trick!

TAG: Simba_004_f
And they would bring back the bigger animals.

TAG: Simba_005_f
It's the Circle of Life.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I think we'll need some water too, or the plants won't last long.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Well, if there used to be water here, there must be a way to bring it back.

TAG: Simba_008_f
I'll try to figure that out while you find the plants.

TAG: Simba_014_f
What sorts of plants should I get? Where can I find them?

TAG: Simba_018_f
You could check some of those jungle ferns near the river. Rafiki said plants come from seeds, so maybe you could get some seeds from those.

TAG: Simba_019_f
Oh, and there's a plant near one of the waterfalls that might have some too.

TAG: Simba_009_f
Yeah. If there used to be water here, there must be a way to bring it back.

TAG: Simba_010_f
I'll try to figure that part out. And maybe you could find some plants.

TAG: Simba_011_f
If there were plants here, that would bring back a lot of the smaller animals.

TAG: Simba_012_f
And they would bring back the bigger animals.

TAG: Simba_013_f
It's the Circle of Life.

TAG: Simba_015_f
Well, it would look a lot nicer if there were plants and water.

TAG: Simba_016_f
That would bring all the animals back.

TAG: Simba_017_f
How about I try to figure out the water while you figure out the plants?
