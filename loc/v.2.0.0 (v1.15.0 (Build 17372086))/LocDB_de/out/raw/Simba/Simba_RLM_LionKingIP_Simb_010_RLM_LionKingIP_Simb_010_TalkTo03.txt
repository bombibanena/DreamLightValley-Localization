When I was young, my father told me that the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I believe it. There's something magical about stars.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Actually, they're balls of gas burning billions of miles away.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Actually, they're fireflies that got stuck up there.

TAG: Simba_001_f
When I look up at them, I know my father was right.

TAG: Simba_016_f
Huh? What do you mean?

TAG: Simba_017_f
Uh, no worries. This might be a bit tough to explain.

TAG: Simba_018_f
But I think I know somebody who might be able to help.

TAG: Simba_014_f
I'll go <Lore>talk to Merlin</Lore> and see if he knows what might be going on.

TAG: Simba_010_f
It's nice to think that those who came before are always up there, guiding us.

TAG: Simba_007_f
If I could just see them... I'd know what to do.

TAG: Simba_008_f
But I can't. Look. There are too many clouds.

TAG: Simba_009_f
I haven't been able to see the stars for a few nights now. Every time I look up at them, it's cloudy.

TAG: Simba_011_f
Wait, how long has this been happening?

TAG: Simba_012_f
Now that I think about it... I can't remember the last time I saw the stars.

TAG: Simba_013_f
That's pretty weird.

TAG: Simba_015_f
I wonder if something magical is going on.

TAG: Simba_002_f
That's what my friend Pumbaa thinks. But it seems kind of far-fetched to me.

TAG: Simba_004_f
I prefer my father's explanation.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Really? That's what my friend Timon told me. I guess they could be, but I still prefer my father's explanation.
