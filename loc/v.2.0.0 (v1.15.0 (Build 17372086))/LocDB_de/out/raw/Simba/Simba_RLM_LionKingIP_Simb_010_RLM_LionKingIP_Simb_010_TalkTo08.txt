Wow! It looks better already.

TAG: Simba_001_f
And this is just the start. Once the animals come back, it'll look even nicer.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This will help the whole jungle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Your dad would be proud.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let's get out of here before a rhinoceros shows up.

TAG: Simba_002_f
Yeah. I guess that's what my father meant about leaving the kingdom better than when I started.

TAG: Simba_004_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I feel like my father's looking down on us right now. Maybe I can be a king worthy of him.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I didn't know him, but I bet you're right... Hey, since we've helped the kingdom...

TAG: Simba_007_f
...why don't you come with me to meet Nala? She's waiting for you in MY kingdom, Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I could use someone there to teach me to be a good ruler.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
We need your "roaring" personality.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's a great place for <i>hakuna matata</i>.

TAG: Simba_008_f
Teach YOU to be a good ruler? I'm still figuring that out myself.

TAG: Simba_009_f
But I guess we could figure it out together.

TAG: Simba_012_f
We've already got a place for you in the Village. Nala is waiting there now.

TAG: Simba_013_f
I'd love to go. Lead the way!

TAG: Simba_010_f
Well, I don't know about that, but I do want to see Nala.

TAG: Simba_011_f
Really? 'Cause after fighting off hyenas and fixing the oasis, I could use a little <i>hakuna matata<i>.

TAG: Simba_003_f
I hope so.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Ha-ha! Don't worry. I'd let you know if I heard a rhino approaching. They make a lot of noise.
