Nala told me that something was bothering you.

TAG: Simba_002_f
Oh... yeah, I guess it is. Everything that happened with the hyenas... well, it just brought back a lot of memories, and now I'm feeling a little lost.

TAG: Simba_013_f
My friend Rafiki likes to bop me on the head with his walking stick when I get like this. Just to knock some sense into me.

TAG: Simba_014_f
I wish he were here to do that now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Anything I can do to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm a good listener, you know.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Want me to bop you over the head instead?

TAG: Simba_003_f
You've helped a lot already.

TAG: Simba_004_f
But I don't know if you're gonna be able to help with this.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I just keep thinking about my father, Mufasa.

TAG: Simba_007_f
I'm pretty new at being king. There are so many decisions. So much is at stake.

TAG: Simba_008_f
I wish my father were here to help me and give me advice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sorry, Simba.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I wish I could do something.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Maybe I can give you advice instead! I'm a great advice-giver.

TAG: Simba_009_f
He told me something once...

TAG: Simba_010_f
Something aboutâ

TAG: Simba_011_f
Hey, why don't I just show you? <Lore>Follow me!</Lore>

TAG: Simba_012_f
I'm sure you'd have lots of good advice, but it wouldn't be the same as hearing it from my father.

TAG: Simba_001_f
I'll bet you are. You've done so much to help Nala and me already.

TAG: Simba_005_f
But I don't know if talking about this is gonna help.

TAG: Simba_015_f
No, that's okay. It's kind of a me and Rafiki thing.

TAG: Simba_016_f
But I appreciate you wanting to help.
