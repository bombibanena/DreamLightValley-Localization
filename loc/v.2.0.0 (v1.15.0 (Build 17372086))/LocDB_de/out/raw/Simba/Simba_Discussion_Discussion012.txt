{PlayerName}, Nala and I are trying to figure something out.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Maybe you can help: Are bats birds?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, bats are birds.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No, bats aren't birds.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I have no idea.

TAG: Simba_002_f
That's what I thought!

TAG: Simba_003_f
They fly, they're not bugs... It just makes sense.

TAG: Simba_004_f
That's what Nala says. She thinks since bats don't have feathers, they're not birds.

TAG: Simba_005_f
But I say, if it flies, and it's not a bug, it's a bird.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I'm pretty sure bats are birds. They fly, they're not bugs... It just makes sense.
