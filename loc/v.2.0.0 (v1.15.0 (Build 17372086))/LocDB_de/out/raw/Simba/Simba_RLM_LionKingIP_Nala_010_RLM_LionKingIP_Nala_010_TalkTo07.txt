Great job! But I think this meal could use more crunch.

There are some <ActivityItem>Red Bugs</ActivityItem> over where you found me earlier. You'll have to dig up the stumps, so be careful.

Once you've got the stumps out, the bugs will start running away. You'll have to be pretty fast to catch 'em.
