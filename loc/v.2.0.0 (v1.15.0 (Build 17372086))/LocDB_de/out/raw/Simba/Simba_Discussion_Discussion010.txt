I'm trying to figure out this riddle Rafiki once told me.

TAG: Simba_001_f
What hide during the day, but guide us at night?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Fireflies.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Stars.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Nocturnal travel guides?

TAG: Simba_002_f
They do hide during the day! Or at least I can't see 'em.

TAG: Simba_003_f
And it's fun to chase 'em. That's kind of like them guiding us. Right?

TAG: Simba_004_f
I think you're right. Stars only come out at night.

TAG: Simba_005_f
And I know I've been guided by the stars...

TAG: Simba_006_f
I'm not sure what that is. But I doubt it's what Rafiki was talking about.
