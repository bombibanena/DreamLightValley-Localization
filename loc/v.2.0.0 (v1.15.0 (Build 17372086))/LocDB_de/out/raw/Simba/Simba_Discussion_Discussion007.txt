I love getting up early and watching the sunrise.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
It's very beautiful.

Why do you like it so much?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Does it remind you of something?

TAG: Simba_006_f
Yeah. And it's different every morning. Different colors. Different light.

TAG: Simba_009_f
It makes everything feel new.

TAG: Simba_007_f
I think it reminds me of my dad?

TAG: Simba_010_f
He got up early once to show me our kingdom at the first light of sunrise.

When I was a very small cub, Rafiki introduced me to all the animals of the kingdom.

TAG: Simba_011_f
I don't really remember. But sometimes I have dreams.

TAG: Simba_012_f
Dreams of being very tiny, and being lifted. And bright sunlight.
