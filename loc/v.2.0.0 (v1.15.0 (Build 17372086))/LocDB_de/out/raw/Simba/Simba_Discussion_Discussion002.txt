My buddy Timon's still a little nervous around Nala. Before they met, she tried to eat Pumbaa.

TAG: Simba_010_f
I'd like them to be better friends. Got any advice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Dinner party.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hunting together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hang out.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Have a party about dinner? What would we eat?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Bugs.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Antelope.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
A chocolate cake?

TAG: Simba_002_f
Timon and Pumbaa would love that. And Nala's starting to come around on 'em.

TAG: Simba_011_f
She's learning they can be slimy, yet satisfying.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Uhh... Timon and Pumbaa don't eat antelope.

TAG: Simba_012_f
And I think seeing Nala eat an antelope would just make Timon more nervous.

TAG: Simba_004_f
I don't know what that is... but I bet Timon and Pumbaa would like it.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I think going hunting with Nala would just make Timon more nervous. He's naturally wary of carnivores.

TAG: Simba_006_f
You mean spend some time relaxing together? That might help... if Timon can relax at all.
