Hey, {PlayerName}... I have an idea of what might be contributing to all the stuff going wrong in the Valley. Do you have time to talk?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm all ears.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not right now.

TAG: Simba_008_f
Okay, I have this theory about the Forgetting and the Night Thorns...

TAG: Simba_007_f
I've noticed how lots of folks come to you with all kinds of problems. Everyone around here seems to have a lot of worries.

TAG: Simba_013_f
Maybe if they could let go of some of those worries, it would help. Ya know, relax and get a new perspective?

TAG: Simba_000_f
My friends Timon and Pumbaa have a whole theory about not worrying too much â <i>hakuna matata</i>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yeah, worrying too much doesn't always help...

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I only worry about important things.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I worry about everything...

TAG: Simba_014_f
I'm glad you agree!

TAG: Simba_017_f
And you know what? I think we should start with you. I've noticed you seem to wear those coverings all the time, since you don't have fur.

TAG: Simba_002_f
But they don't look very comfortable. Maybe you could find some that are.

TAG: Simba_019_f
Good idea. I could put together the most relaxing and casual outfit of all time. That would be a fun challenge.

TAG: Simba_020_f
Well, I can't wait to see what you come up with!

TAG: Simba_015_f
Oh yeah, of course. You're the Ruler of these lands, and you have a lot of responsibilities.

TAG: Simba_003_f
But it doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to relax too. Like, I've noticed you wear those coverings all the time, since you don't have fur.

TAG: Simba_016_f
That doesn't sound very healthy, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Simba_018_f
Just hear me out... I think we can do a few things to help everyone relax a little.

TAG: Simba_004_f
And, hey, why don't we start with you? I've noticed you seem to wear those coverings all the time, since you don't have fur.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I understand. Well, whenever you can.
