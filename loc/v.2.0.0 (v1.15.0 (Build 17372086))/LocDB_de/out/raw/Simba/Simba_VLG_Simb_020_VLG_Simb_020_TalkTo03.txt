Oh, I feel so bad. I completely forgot I was supposed to help Nala today.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I've gotta make it up to her. And she said that odd thing about me having a special role here...

TAG: Simba_008_f
Yeah, it sounds like her memories started to come back when she was scouting for food.

TAG: Simba_021_f
Maybe yours will too. And it seems really important to Nala.

TAG: Simba_006_f
It is.

TAG: Simba_007_f
She wants to make sure all the animals in the Valley have food. Maybe Nala has the right idea and something isn't right with how the Circle of Life should be working.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds like she was right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Where do you want to start?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Please don't eat the critters.

TAG: Simba_009_f
Yeah, if everyone doesn't understand the Circle of Life, bad things can happen.

TAG: Simba_010_f
Nala's worried that the rabbits don't have enough to eat. Goofy says they like carrots, so how 'bout we plant and grow some <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem> just to be sure?

TAG: Simba_013_f
Let's take it a little further. I'll feed some of the animals around the Village too.

TAG: Simba_014_f
Good idea, but some of the creatures around here seem pretty hard for you to approach. I've gotten to know most of them. Do you want some help?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Yes, please!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm good. Let's go feed some critters!

TAG: Simba_015_f
Great! Which creatures do you wanna know about?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
The squirrels and sunbirds.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
The rabbits or the foxes.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
The baby turtles and the ravens.

TAG: Player_003_choice_003_f
The raccoons and crocodiles.

TAG: Player_003_choice_005_f
I'm good. Let's go feed some critters!

TAG: Simba_017_f
Oh, they don't fear anyone. They'll think you're a friend.

TAG: Simba_000_f
Just go to them. It won't be any trouble.

TAG: Simba_018_f
Oh, those guys love to run and play.

TAG: Simba_002_f
You'll have to join their game and catch them if you wanna give them food.

TAG: Simba_019_f
It's funny. You'd think turtles and ravens wouldn't have anything in common, but they do.

TAG: Simba_023_f
They're both shy, so it'll take time for them to get used to you.

TAG: Simba_003_f
Just stand near them calmly. That way, they'll know there's nothing to fear, and they'll relax.

TAG: Simba_020_f
Oh, they're the most wary creatures in the Valley. You need to be pretty careful when you approach them...

TAG: Simba_004_f
When you see them watching their surroundings, stop moving.

TAG: Simba_022_f
Only move again when you see they're relaxed... but stop as soon as you see them about to stand on guard again.

TAG: Simba_016_f
Okay. And hey, don't hesitate to ask me again if you change your mind.

TAG: Simba_011_f
You don't have to worry about that.

TAG: Simba_012_f
I have enough food around here with all the fish and stuff from Remy.
