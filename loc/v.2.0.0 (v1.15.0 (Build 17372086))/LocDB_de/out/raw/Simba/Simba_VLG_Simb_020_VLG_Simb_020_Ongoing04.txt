Could we plant and grow some <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem> in the Meadow for the Rabbits? I know that'll make Nala feel better.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Oh, and you also wanted to feed some of the other animals in the Valley. Do you need some pointers on how to approach them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, please!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm good. Let's go feed some critters!

TAG: Simba_002_f
Great! Which creatures do you wanna know about?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The squirrels and sunbirds.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The rabbits or the foxes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The baby turtles and the ravens.

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
The raccoons and crocodiles.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
I'm good. Let's go feed some critters!

TAG: Simba_003_f
Oh, they don't fear anyone. They'll think you're a friend.

TAG: Simba_000_f
Just go to them. It won't be any trouble.

TAG: Simba_004_f
Oh, those guys love to run and play.

TAG: Simba_011_f
You'll have to join their game and catch them if you wanna give them food.

TAG: Simba_005_f
It's funny. You'd think turtles and ravens wouldn't have anything in common, but they do.

TAG: Simba_006_f
They're both shy, so it'll take time for them to get used to you.

TAG: Simba_012_f
Just stand near them calmly. That way, they'll know there's nothing to fear, and they'll relax.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Oh, they're the most wary of creatures in the Valley. You need to be pretty careful when you approach them...

TAG: Simba_013_f
When you see them watching their surroundings, stop moving.

TAG: Simba_008_f
Only move again when you see they're relaxed... but stop as soon as you see them about to stand on guard again.

TAG: Simba_009_f
Okay. And hey, don't hesitate to ask me again if you change your mind.
