Everything here is your kingdom?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Everything the light touches.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Not just my kingdom. We all share in it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Well, except for the parts overrun by Night Thorns.

TAG: Simba_002_f
That's amazing.

TAG: Simba_006_f
I'm gonna go find Nala. I can't wait for us to explore this place together!

TAG: Simba_003_f
Simba! Wait. There's one thing I have to warn you about.

TAG: Simba_008_f
Watch out for Scar.

TAG: Simba_009_f
... Scar? He's here?

TAG: Simba_010_f
But... how? That can't be possible.

TAG: Simba_011_f
After everything he did to my family...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll keep Scar in line. Don't worry.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe you can help me handle him.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It'll be okay. <i>Hakuna matata</i>, right?

TAG: Simba_012_f
So far Scar seems too lazy to try anything. I've got him on a pretty short leash.

TAG: Simba_013_f
That's good. But still... I think I'll keep clear of him. There are just... a lot of bad memories.

TAG: Simba_018_f
Thanks for warning me, {PlayerName}. I'm gonna go find Nala.

TAG: Simba_014_f
Scar hasn't caused too much trouble so far. But if he does, I need someone like you around to help me deal with him.

TAG: Simba_015_f
Don't worry. If he tries anything, Nala and I will be there to stop him.

TAG: Simba_016_f
Dreamlight Valley's kind of funny. I don't think Scar is quite the Scar you remember him being.

TAG: Simba_017_f
That's good. But still... I think I'll keep clear of him. There are just... a lot of bad memories.

TAG: Simba_004_f
That's a good perspective for a ruler to have. I think we're gonna learn a lot from each other.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Night Thorns, huh? Maybe I can help you with that.

TAG: Simba_007_f
I'll bet you could. I'll let you know if I need your help.
