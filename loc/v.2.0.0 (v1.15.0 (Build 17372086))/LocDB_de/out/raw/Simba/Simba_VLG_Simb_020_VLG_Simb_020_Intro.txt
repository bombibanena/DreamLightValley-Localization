Hey, {PlayerName}, I have something I was hoping you could help me with. I want to do something to bring everyone in the Valley together.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure! Let's do this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Busy, sorry.

TAG: Simba_011_f
Thanks! But I should tell you, Nala and I both want to help the Valley, except we don't exactly agree on the best way to do it.

TAG: Simba_012_f
She's sure that something isn't right with how the Circle of Life should be working.

TAG: Simba_015_f
But I get the feeling it's more about community.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Community â that makes sense.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What do you want to do exactly?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Isn't Nala going to be upset?

TAG: Simba_016_f
I thought you'd understand. So here's what I want to do...

TAG: Simba_001_f
When I was a baby, all the animals in the Pride Lands gathered at Pride Rock for a celebration.

TAG: Simba_005_f
I'd love to do something like that here. Bring everyone in your kingdom together!

TAG: Simba_010_f
If we're doing this, we better do it right. And those things are always better with food.

TAG: Simba_003_f
I'm sure Remy has some ideas for what we can serve. I'll go see him.

TAG: Simba_006_f
Great idea!

TAG: Simba_017_f
I don't think so. Besides, helping in one way doesn't mean we can't also help in another, right? So here's my idea...

TAG: Simba_002_f
I understand. Come see me whenever you have the time.
