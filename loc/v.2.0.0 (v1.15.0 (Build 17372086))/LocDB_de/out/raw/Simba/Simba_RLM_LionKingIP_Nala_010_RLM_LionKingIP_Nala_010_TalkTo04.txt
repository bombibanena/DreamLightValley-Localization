Grr...

TAG: Simba_007_f
*ROAR!*

TAG: Player_000_f
Uh-oh. I think I scared Simba. What did Nala tell me to say to calm him down?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
<i>Hakuna matata</i>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No worries! No worries!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Here, kitty kitty!

TAG: Simba_002_f
Huh? Did you just say "<i>hakuna matata</i>"?

TAG: Simba_003_f
Are you a friend of Timon and Pumbaa?

TAG: Simba_004_f
Actually, I'm a friend of Nala! She sent me to find you.

TAG: Simba_011_f
Nala! I've been looking all over the jungle for her.

TAG: Simba_014_f
She's waiting on the other side of the river.

TAG: Simba_015_f
Wow! Thanks for the help. Any friend of Nala's is a friend of mine.

TAG: Simba_012_f
Oh, and uh... sorry about roaring at you before.

TAG: Simba_013_f
With all these hyenas around, we can't be too careful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Hey, no worries!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's always good to... be prepared.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Just don't roar at me like that again, okay?

TAG: Simba_016_f
You certainly know Timon and Pumbaa's motto. I think you'd get along pretty well with them.

TAG: Simba_019_f
Why don't we <Lore>go see Nala</Lore>? She's right near the entrance to the jungle.

TAG: Simba_020_f
Great! Let's go.

TAG: Simba_017_f
"Be prepared"? Hm. For some reason, hearing that is kind of unsettling.

TAG: Simba_001_f
Maybe it just reminds me of someone. Oh well.

TAG: Simba_018_f
Don't worry. I promise. No more roaring.

TAG: Simba_005_f
Do you mean "<i>hakuna matata</i>"?

TAG: Simba_006_f
Are you a friend of Timon and Pumbaa?

TAG: Simba_008_f
Kitty? Not exactly. Now, who are you?

TAG: Simba_009_f
Wait a second. I know what's going on here.

TAG: Simba_010_f
Are you a friend of Timon and Pumbaa? Did they send you to play a prank on me?
