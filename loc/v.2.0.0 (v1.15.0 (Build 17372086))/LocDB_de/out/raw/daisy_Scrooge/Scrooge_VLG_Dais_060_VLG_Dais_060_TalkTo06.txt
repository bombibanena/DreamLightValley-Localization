Ah, {PlayerName}, I heard there was some sort of kerfuffle up at the Castle. How can I help you?

TAG: Player_000_f
Daisy thinks you tried to sabotage her gala with a glitter bomb...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The glitter was in a box from YOUR store.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm just trying to find the culprit.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't think it's you, but I have to ask.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Sparkle me spats! If I sent a box of glitter with the rest of what Daisy rented, she would've opened it while she was getting ready for her party.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
That so-called glitter bomb would've gone off WELL before the end of the event.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The culprit hid the glitter in an empty box!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're being framed!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Precisely, detective. Someone's covering their tracks â but not very well.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Here's a REAL lead for you. If you want to find out who used glitter to ruin Daisy's gala, you should <Lore>follow the glitter on Dazzle Beach.</Lore>

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
I was taking my daily perambulation there, and someone's dropped an entire shipment of glitter! It's blended with the sand, but it forms a very clear trail.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
I'll bet my last Star Coin that if you follow it, you'll find the hideout of the real culprit.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
I need to see that for myself. I'll <Lore>investigate Dazzle Beach</Lore>.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
As though I'd waste my valuable time with such a childish prank. Glitter...

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
I appreciate your confidence in me, {PlayerName}. I promise I hadnae any involvement in the mischief!
