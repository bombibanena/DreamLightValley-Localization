Mickey, I was wondering if you could help me and the Beast out with something.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Sure, {PlayerName}, I'd be happy to!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
What's on your mind?

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Well, the Beast is trying to work on his relationship with Belle. We wanted some tips on how you and Minnie keep your relationship so strong...

TAG: Mickey_004_f
...while also giving each other the space to do your own thing!

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Wow, that's a great question. Hmm...

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Well, one thing we do a lot is go on special date nights so we can be together, just the two of us.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh, the classic date night!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's so simple â why didn't I think of that?!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Yep!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Sometimes if we have a week where we haven't done much together...

TAG: Mickey_009_f
We make sure to get together and share what we've been up to.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
We've been sweethearts for a long time, but we always wanna keep learning new things about each other!

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Thanks, Mickey!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
That's some great advice for the Beast!

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Anytime, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Aw, that's okay. It took Minnie and me a while to come up with the idea, too.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Well, she might not be in the Valley with us now...

TAG: Mickey_016_f
...but I can tell you what our routine used to be.

TAG: Mickey_017_f
We love having special date nights so we can be together, just the two of us.
