What was it like growing up in the Encanto, Mirabel?

It was actually pretty amazing. Our whole town is like a great big family.

We help each other, and there's always someone looking out for you.

That sounds nice. The palace where I grew up felt pretty lonely at times.

That must've been hard. I hope you don't ever get lonely here. The Valley's like a family, too.
