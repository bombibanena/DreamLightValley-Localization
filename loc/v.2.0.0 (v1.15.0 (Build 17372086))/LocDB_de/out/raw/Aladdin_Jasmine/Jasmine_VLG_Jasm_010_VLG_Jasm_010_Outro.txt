Jasmine! The Enchanted Flower bloomed!

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
It did! But... what's the secret?

TAG: Jasmine_019_f
I'm not sure... There's an old <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem> stuck within the petals.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Looking at it... it gives me a really strange feeling.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
It reminds me of when I was younger. I feel sort of...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...lonely.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...scared.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
...angry.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
You used to feel lonely?

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
Yes, sometimes. Even when I was surrounded by people, I still felt like no one really heard me.

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
This <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem> must have some kind of magic that's making me feel this way.

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
That must be it. I wonder what's written inside?

TAG: Jasmine_020_f
I'd suggest we check, but <Lore>it's locked tight, and it looks like we'll need two keys to open it</Lore>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
If we could open it, we'd know where it came from!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm nervous to see what's inside.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
This is so... confusing.

TAG: Jasmine_021_f
It must have belonged to someone important once, right?

TAG: Jasmine_024_f
That's exactly what I was thinking.

TAG: Jasmine_026_f
Hmm... There's a code on the cover that looks familiar. I'm sure I can decipher it if I have a little time.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
And that might open one of the locks?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It seems pretty complicated...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Ugh, this is frustrating!

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Possibly. I'll have to do some translations to find out for sure.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Why don't I take a closer look at this, and then come find you once I know what it says. I have a feeling it'll be a clue to opening the journal.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
All right. Thanks, Jasmine. Let me know when you work it out!

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
I've studied these sorts of codes before. I'm sure I'll figure it out.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
I understand, but I'm sure we'll figure it out.

TAG: Jasmine_022_f
It must have been hidden away for a reason, don't you think?

TAG: Jasmine_025_f
Maybe. But I also think we found it for a reason.

TAG: Jasmine_023_f
Who owned this journal? Why was it hidden away?

TAG: Jasmine_027_f
I don't know, but I'm sure we'll figure it out.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
You used to feel scared?

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
Yes, sometimes. There were all these expectations of me. I was afraid I could never live up to them.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
You used to feel angry?

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
Yes, sometimes. I had so many responsibilities! But all I wanted to do was be FREE.
