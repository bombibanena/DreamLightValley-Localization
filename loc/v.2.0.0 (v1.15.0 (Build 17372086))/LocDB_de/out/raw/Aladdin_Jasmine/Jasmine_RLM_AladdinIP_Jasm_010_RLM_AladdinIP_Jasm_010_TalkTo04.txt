Aladdin! It's really you!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Are you all right?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Well, let's go rescue Carpet!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Now we can work together to save Agrabah!

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Huh, you seem familiar. Like we met a long time ago...

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
It's me, {PlayerName}. I came to see if you and Jasmine want to visit Dreamlight Valley with me.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Dreamlight Valley? That sort of rings a bell...

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I'm here to find you! I got to Agrabah and found the Windcaller just looming over everything and whipping the winds into a frenzy...

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I was able to make my way over to Jasmine and she explained what was going on.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
Heh. Yeah, I guess I've been stuck here for a while now. I was trying to fly up to the Windcaller to figure things out, but Carpet and I got hit by a nasty downdraft.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
I fell here, and Carpet's been caught up in the winds ever since.

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
I'm fine. The worst I've had to deal with is some sand-burn.

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Well, get ready to head back into the marketplace to fix things up!

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
And then maybe you and Jasmine will be able to take a break and visit Dreamlight Valley with me.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Ya know, that place sounds more and more familiar... But Jasmine'll want to make sure that everyone in Agrabah's safe before we go anywhere.
