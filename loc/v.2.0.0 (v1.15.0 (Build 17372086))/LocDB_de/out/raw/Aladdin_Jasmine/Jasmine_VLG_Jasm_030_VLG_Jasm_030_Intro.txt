{PlayerName}, I've found a clue for the other key to the Secret Journal! Do you have time to look at it with me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yes! I want this mystery solved!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not right now.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
I discovered that on the back of the first key, there is an engraving of a seashell image. It got me thinking... What if the other lock is a clue to the second key?

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Great theory! What did you find?

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
That's the best part. The second lock does have an engraving... It's a SNOWFLAKE!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Why is that so exciting?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do you like snow THAT much?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Ugh, I hate the cold...

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Because that points us to SNOW! I think snow's fascinating, don't you?

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
There isn't any snow near Agrabah. So, as a child, I dreamed of cold, snowy lands to explore.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I didn't grow up with snow either.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I LOVED the snow as a child!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
We had TOO MUCH snow where I grew up.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
I used to daydream about snowmen and snowball fights all the time!

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
And sledding and warm tea after a cold day...

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
So what do you think? Should we head towards the snow?

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
Yes! I think that's the direction the lock is pointing us. I'll go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore> about this. If anyone will know about a mysterious key in the Frosted Heights, it's her!

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
I loved sledding and building snowmen and all that good stuff!

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
You're so lucky! I always wanted to go sledding as a child.

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
I enjoyed playing in it sometimes, but mostly it was just cold and wet.

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
Well, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound quite as magical.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
I do! Or at least, I think I do.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Really? I'm definitely more accustomed to the heat, but I find the cold fascinating!

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
All right. I'll be ready whenever you are.
