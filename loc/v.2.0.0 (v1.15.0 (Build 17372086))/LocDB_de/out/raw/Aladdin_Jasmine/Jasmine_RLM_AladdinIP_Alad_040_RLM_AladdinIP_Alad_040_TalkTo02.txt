Jasmine! How are you feeling?

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
I'm so relieved it's finally over!

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I keep running over a list in my mind of what the people of Agrabah need to be safe and... I think it's finally completed!

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Yeah! And now I think you deserve a well-earned vacation. Why don't you come visit Dreamlight Valley with me?

TAG: Jasmine_000_f
There are a lot of people that miss you and haven't seen you since the Forgetting. I promise, you'll start to remember once you get there.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
It's strange, but I feel like everything you're saying is... true. And right. Is there somewhere for Aladdin and I to stay?

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Not right now, but that can be the first thing we do when we arrive!

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Then I'd be happy to go. Thank you. I just need to say goodbye to my father and Rajah first.
