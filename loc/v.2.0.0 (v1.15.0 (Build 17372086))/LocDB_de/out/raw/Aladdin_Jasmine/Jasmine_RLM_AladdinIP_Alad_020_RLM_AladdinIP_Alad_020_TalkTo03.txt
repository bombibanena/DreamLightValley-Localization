Jasmine, could you take a look at this? Aladdin and I found it. We were wondering if you had any idea what it might be for.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
Oh, it's beautiful! The quality of the craftsmanship is exquisite...

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Hmm, now if I remember correctly, this phrasing signifies "protection" of some sort. But from what?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
From genies?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
From evil viziers?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
From ancient wind structures?

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
No, I don't think so.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
There are also mentions of caravans, and the "bite of the desert's rage"... Do you think that could be a reference to sandstorms?

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Protection against sandstorms?! That's perfect! There are those giant whirling veils of sand around Agrabah that are blocking me from exploring!

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Oh, but there are three indentations here that look like settings for gemstones.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
If we <Lore>find the three missing stones</Lore>, that might activate the power of the Amulet!

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Great, we've got our next objective then!

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
Thank you so much for your help. Here's the Amulet back. Once the stones are found, Aladdin should be able to set them properly.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Well, that would have been useful in the past, but no...

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Let's see...
