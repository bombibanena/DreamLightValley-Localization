Oh, that's a good question! I like a lot of things.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
But I suppose my favorite is exploring â seeing new places and meeting new people.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Me too!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I was never bitten by the travel bug.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
But exploring can be dangerous!

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Isn't it wonderful?

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
You never know what adventures await you in a new place.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
The travel bug? I've never heard of such a creature.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Oh, it's just an expression. It means you get a taste for travel, and want to do it all the time.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Well, in that case, I've definitely been bitten by that bug!

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Perhaps. But it's worth the risk, and I'm always careful.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
You just need to plan ahead.
