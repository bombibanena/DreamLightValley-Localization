{PlayerName}, we have a problem, and I think it might be linked to your <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem>. I'll need your help to figure it out.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd be happy to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't have time right now.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
I'm so glad because this is very strange.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I was taking a walk this morning and saw Donald Duck. He seemed upset about something.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Very typical of Donald.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Oh no! What about?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I don't see how Donald is linked to the journal...

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I suppose that's true.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
But I wanted to help, so I asked him what was wrong.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Apparently, his House is completely covered in old fish!

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Old fish? Where did they come from?

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
That's the thing... Donald had no idea. But he did tell me when they started to appear, and it's right <Lore>when we opened your Secret Journal</Lore>.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
That can't be a coincidence! I'll <Lore>talk to Donald and try to get to the bottom of this</Lore>! Can you ask around and see if anyone else has noticed anything odd?

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Of course. Good luck with Donald!

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Well, it's very odd...

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
I'll explain.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
I asked Donald what was wrong, in case I could help.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
All right. But it is rather urgent.
