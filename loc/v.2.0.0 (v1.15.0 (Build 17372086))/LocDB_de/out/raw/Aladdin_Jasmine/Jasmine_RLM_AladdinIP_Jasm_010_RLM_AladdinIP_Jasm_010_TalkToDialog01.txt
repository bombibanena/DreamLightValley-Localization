Jasmine!

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
Hello? Do I know you? If you're a visitor to Agrabah, I'm afraid you've come at a rather difficult time.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
Agrabah is unfortunately a dangerous place right now â I had not expected to see anyone here.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Oh, I'm {PlayerName}. I come from a faraway place called Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Dreamlight Valley... That does sound familiar, but I can't recall exactly where it is. And you... You seem familiar too.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
We met before, but it was a long time ago.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Maybe if we talk more, your memories will come back.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
All you need to know is that I'm here to help.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
There may be some magic at work here... Let's talk about it later.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
It's funny... For some reason, I know I can trust you.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
You can. I promise. So... what's been going on here?! Everything is all... windy and sandy.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
That's an understatement. When you came into town, did you see that <Lore>floating stone structure</Lore>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's kinda hard to miss.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I was wondering about that.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh wow, no â guess I was focusing on the market.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
Well, the problems began when we started some recent construction in the marketplace.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
I wanted to build a new fountain so that everyone in Agrabah could have an additional source of fresh water.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Sounds like a great idea!

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
I thought so, but it turns out I should've done more research before choosing a location.

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
When the construction crew was excavating to place some pipes, they stumbled onto a buried vault with that stone structure inside.

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
As soon as it was exposed to the air, these winds began to stir! The structure floated into the air, and the winds just got stronger and stronger.

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
In moments, it was hovering over the marketplace and the winds were depositing sand all over Agrabah!

TAG: Jasmine_019_f
We've been referring to it as <Lore>the Windcaller</Lore>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Do you know where it came from?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Where's Aladdin?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Are the people of Agrabah all right?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Let's get to work!

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
No. But it must be older than Agrabah itself! Or it's from a version of the city that's been lost to history.

TAG: Jasmine_025_f
Okay â what's our next step then? I'm here to help.

TAG: Jasmine_024_f
Thank you! I can't tell you how much I appreciate that. Now then, I think we should <Lore>find Aladdin</Lore> first. He was looking for a way to stop the winds from the rooftops, but I'm afraid he's been trapped somewhere.

TAG: Jasmine_030_f
I've been trying too, but most of Agrabah's streets are blocked by a strange, incredibly tough sandstone formed by the storm deposits.

TAG: Jasmine_032_f
Maybe I can find a way to help? Normally I would use my Royal Pickaxe, but it doesn't do anything to the sandstone!

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Do you think there's something around here that I could use to make it stronger?

TAG: Jasmine_031_f
Hmm... Well, <Lore>the Artisans' District</Lore> is nearby. With any luck, we'll find something there that will help.

TAG: Jasmine_021_f
I'm not sure. He and the Magic Carpet were trying to find a way to stop the winds, but Carpet got trapped in a vortex.

TAG: Jasmine_022_f
Aladdin must have been trapped somewhere as well, otherwise he would have certainly returned to me.

TAG: Jasmine_023_f
For now, yes. They're sheltering in the palace where they're safe.

TAG: Jasmine_029_f
But that's not a permanent solution. We need to stop these winds.
