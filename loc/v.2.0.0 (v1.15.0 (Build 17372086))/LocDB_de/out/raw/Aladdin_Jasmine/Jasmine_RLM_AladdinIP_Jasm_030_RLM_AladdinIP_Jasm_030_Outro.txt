{PlayerName}, you did it! I'm so happy the Magic Carpet's safe again. Thank you!

Easy as pie.

We all did it â together!

Agrabah will be back to normal soon!

Perhaps for you. I know it was a difficult task.

Now we only have the Windcaller to deal with.

I think you should work with Aladdin on that. Though the way's been cleared, I'm sure the winds up high are intense, and Aladdin's a much more experienced flyer than I am.

The three of you will have to <Lore>head up to the top of the wind swirl</Lore>, and then hopefully we can put an end to this whole mess.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
You're right. Things are always easier when you have friends to help out.

And I can't wait to tell the residents of Agrabah that it's safe to return to their homes.
