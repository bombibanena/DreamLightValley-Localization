I remembered one of my favorite pieces from when I was a child and did my best to recreate it.

You must have worked hard on this!

Are you okay parting with it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did it remind you of Agrabah?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This is great! Thanks!

It reminded me of playing by myself growing up and how lonely that could be.

I think it'll be good to see this centerpiece used for something I've made with a friend.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Thank you, Jasmine. I think you're right.

Now let's go win this competition so we can make the Beach Key and open that Secret Journal!

I'll admit: Building it brought up some... complicated feelings.

I'm glad you like it! We'll need something pretty fabulous if we're going to beat Maui.

Though I'll admit that building it did bring up some... complicated feelings.
