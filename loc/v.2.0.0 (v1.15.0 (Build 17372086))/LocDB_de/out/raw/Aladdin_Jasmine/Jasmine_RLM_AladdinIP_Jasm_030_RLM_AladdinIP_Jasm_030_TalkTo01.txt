Hey Aladdin, can we talk about your experience with wishes?

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
Sure! What do you want to know?

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
Any details you can share would be good. You never know what might lead us to some of the wish magic.

TAG: Player_000_f
Tell me about...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...your first wish.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...your second wish.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...your third wish.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
No, I know all about those wishes already.

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Oh, that one... Not exactly my smartest idea, but I wished to be a prince.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
I was in an oasis not too far from Agrabah, and Abu and I had managed to trick Genie into getting us out of the Cave of Wonders.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
He was kinda annoyed that we pulled one over on him, so I had to be pretty clear that this was my first wish.

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
Well, let's get started. Those remnants of Genie's wishes won't find themselves!

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
My second wish was a real emergency.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
I was caught by the guards loyal to Jafar, and they slapped some manacles on me and threw me into the sea!

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
I never would've made it without Genie's help. To be honest, I barely even remember making the wish, but I'm sure glad Genie saved me.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
That was definitely my best wish!

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
We were on a balcony overlooking the city, and I wished for Genie's freedom.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
Genie didn't believe me at first. I think I was halfway to being a prince again before he really heard what I'd wished.
