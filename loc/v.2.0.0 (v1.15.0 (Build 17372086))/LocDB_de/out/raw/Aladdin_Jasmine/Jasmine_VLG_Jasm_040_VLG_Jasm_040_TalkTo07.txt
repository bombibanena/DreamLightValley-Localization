You did it, {PlayerName}! The wish magic is completely contained in your journal. I can tell because it feels... calmer now. I don't know how to explain it.

I feel a lot better now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's all it took?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you SURE?

Doing the things that I wanted to do, just for ME, felt really good.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
I'm so glad to hear it.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Though I'd still like to make sure that the wish magic is gone for good.

Maybe we should check on Mike. His wish magic didn't work on you because you're the owner of the journal, but if I go near him and can control my laughter, we'll know everything's back to normal.

Great idea! Let's <Lore>test the wish magic by talking to Mike</Lore>. He could probably use a visit anyway. He was feeling down since everyone was laughing at him.

It seems so. I suppose the journal needed to know you've made your own wish come true. You embraced your freedom and made YOURSELF happy.

I have to admit, doing the things that I wanted to do, just for ME, felt really good.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I am. I suppose the journal needed to know you've made your own wish come true. You embraced your freedom and made YOURSELF happy.
