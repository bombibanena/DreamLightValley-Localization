I've spoken to Donald, Anna, and Mike. All of them made a wish that's gone a little haywire.

TAG: Jasmine_000_f
That lines up with a theory I have... In your journal, you wrote, "If only wishes really did come true"?

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
What if opening the journal caused this strange wish magic to escape?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
So this is my fault?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do you think the wish magic can be dangerous?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I was thinking something similar.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
It's no one's fault, {PlayerName}. Opening the journal was important.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
But now we need to rein in the magic so it stops creating such chaos.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
How do we do that?

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
I'm not sure. Do you remember the wish you wrote about in your journal?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I wanted more freedom.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I wanted to be understood for who I am.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I wanted to take care of myself for once.

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
That's right. So maybe if you do something to embrace your freedom, the wish magic can be contained again.

TAG: Jasmine_019_f
That's a good idea!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'd like to decorate a room in my House.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd like to cook my favorite meals.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Perfect! Decorating's a wonderful way to embrace your personal taste.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Okay, I'll go <Lore>decorate a room in my House</Lore>, and I'll make sure it really reflects me!

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
Fabulous! A meal cooked just to your taste is a wonderful way to do what YOU want to do.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
Okay, I'll go <Lore>cook two of my favorite meals</Lore>, and I'll make sure they really reflect me!

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
That's right. So maybe if you do something to showcase the real you, the wish magic can be contained again.

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
That's right. So maybe if you do something to take care of yourself, the wish magic can be contained again.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
I highly doubt it. Only fairly benign wishes are coming true.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
I thought you might have worked it out already.
