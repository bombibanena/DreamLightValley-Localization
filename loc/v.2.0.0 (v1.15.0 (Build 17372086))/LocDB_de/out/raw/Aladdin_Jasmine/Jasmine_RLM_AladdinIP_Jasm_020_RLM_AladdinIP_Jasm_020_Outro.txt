Okay Jasmine, I have the lamp, all ready to be enchanted!

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
Marvelous!

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Are you sure you aren't a genie, {PlayerName}? You're certainly making all our wishes come true!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Nah, I don't do well with itty-bitty living spaces.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Phenomenal cosmic powers? More like Dreamlight powers.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Kind of. But not exactly. Let's say genie-adjacent.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
Hmm... Sounds familiar.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
It turns out genie magic is going to help us. I've translated more of the Tome!

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
It says we need wish magic, and it explains that every time a genie grants a wish, there's a chance of a magical remnant or "echo."

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
If we can find remnants of the wishes that Aladdin made, we can use them to enchant the <ActivityItem>Golden Lamp</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
The question is â how do we do that?

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Hmm, sounds like it might be a job for some Dreamlight Magic!

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
Oh, I didn't know you had that sort of power, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Why don't you <Lore>talk to Aladdin</Lore>? He can tell you more about the wishes he made.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Well, I am glad for your powers â without them, this would be far more difficult.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Hmm... Perhaps you can explain more later.
