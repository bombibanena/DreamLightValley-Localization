You must mean Rajah. He's one of my dearest friends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How long have you known each other?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is he dangerous?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Does he enjoy being petted?

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
Since I was a little girl, and since he was a cub.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
I suppose you could say we grew up together.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
Not at all! Unless he thinks I'm in danger, Rajah's just a big kitten. He wouldn't hurt a fly.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
But... if that fly were a pompous, self-absorbed suitor...

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
...he might play with them a little to scare them off.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
By me? Yes... But he needs to be in a good mood if anyone else wants to pet him.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
You never want to pet a cat unless they want it.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
That's doubly true for a tiger.
