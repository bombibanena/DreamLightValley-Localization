I suppose I am. I'm rehearsing giving a speech.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
When I am queen, I want to speak to my people often.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What will you talk about?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Public speaking is NOT my thing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Should I give speeches?

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Oh, lots of things... What's happening in Agrabah and how I want to make things better.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I want them to know that the palace is there to help them.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
I also want a way for everyone to share their thoughts with me and tell me what they need.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Do you have any suggestions for how I could do that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A public forum?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
A suggestion box?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Disguise yourself and eavesdrop in the marketplace!

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
That could be complicated to organize, but I like the idea. I'll have to think about it.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Yes... But I'd like it to be a bit more personal.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
I know! I could have one of the palace staff stationed in the marketplace to take messages.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
Hm... I know someone who could help me with that.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I understand. I'm not very comfortable with it either. That's why I'm practicing.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Not if you don't want to. The Valley is small enough that you can talk to everyone personally.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Agrabah is much bigger, so it would be impossible to talk to every person very often.
