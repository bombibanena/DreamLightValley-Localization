Finally! We've made it. This is the <Lore>Artisans' District</Lore>.

It looks a little worse for wear.

Is there a metalworker nearby?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What will we do here?

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
You're right. I suppose being so close to the Windcaller, it was especially affected by the sandstorms.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
I wanted to come here because the artisans in Agrabah make special tools to work the extremely hard stone found in the area.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
We should be able to find ingots of a substance called <ActivityItem>Artisans' Alloy</ActivityItem> that's far harder and more durable than regular metals.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
That's great! If I find enough of that, I bet I can <Lore>upgrade my Royal Pickaxe</Lore> so it'll break down the sandstone barriers! Then, we'll really have a shot at finding Aladdin!

TAG: Jasmine_000_f
Wonderful! Don't forget to <Lore>check chests in the area</Lore> â the alloy is a valuable metal so would have been placed somewhere secure for safekeeping.

I'm afraid he's at the palace with everyone else.
