Jasmine! What are you doing here?

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I heard you were asking around the Village about some sort of pillar, covered in art. So I thought, perhaps, you could use my help.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I studied a lot of ancient art in the library at the palace.

TAG: Player_002_f
We think this pillar leads to treasure...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Now we can search as a team!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sounds like you're the expert we need!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I knew we should have invited you...

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
I'd love to join you.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
So, tell me... What combinations have you tried?

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
Combinations?

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
Yes. Combinations of symbols on this pillar. The <Lore>pieces rotate</Lore>, don't they?

TAG: Jasmine_000_f
I'm sure they'll <Lore>complete a story</Lore> from bottom to top. We should look around for clues that will tell us the correct order of symbols.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
I can't believe I didn't think of this before... I'm really glad you're here, Jasmine.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
I don't know if I'm an expert, but I might be able to help.

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
Well, I'm here now.
