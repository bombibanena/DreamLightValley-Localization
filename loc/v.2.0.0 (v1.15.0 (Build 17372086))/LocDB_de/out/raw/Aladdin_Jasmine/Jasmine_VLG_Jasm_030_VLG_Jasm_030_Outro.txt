Now that I have the journal... I guess there's nothing left to do but read it.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
You can do this. Remember: I'm here for you.

TAG: Jasmine_025_f
It says, "People expect so much from me. It's so hard. I feel like I'm falling apart at the seams..."

TAG: Jasmine_024_f
Oh, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
There's more...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
... "I don't think anyone really understands me."

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
... "I'm so sick and tired of responsibilities!"

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
... "I can't possibly meet everyone's expectations."

TAG: Jasmine_022_f
... "I wish I had the freedom to do what I wanted, just once. If only wishes really did come true..."

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Oh, {PlayerName}... I don't know what to say.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
I remember now... When I was young, it felt like everyone was telling me what to do all of the time. I never had a chance to do what I wanted, to just be myself.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I felt so alone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I was so frustrated.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It was so stressful.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Loneliness is one of the most difficult things for all of us to deal with.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
The worst part was how trapped I felt. This journal was the only place I felt free to be honest about myself.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
I understand what it's like to feel trapped and that no one understands you.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
I'm sorry you ever felt that way.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
Thanks. Finding this journal feels... strange.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I think I need time to think.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's bringing up a lot of old feelings.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I kind of wish I never found it.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Of course. Taking some time to work things out will help.

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
Whatever comes next, please know that you're not alone.

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
Thanks, Jasmine. I appreciate that.

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
Wait... {PlayerName}, did you feel that just now?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Yes! It felt like the journal was... shuddering?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I think so? I noticed SOMETHING strange...

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
No... What was it?

TAG: Jasmine_026_f
Yes, exactly!

TAG: Jasmine_029_f
What does that mean?

TAG: Jasmine_020_f
I don't know. The journal certainly has magical properties. I thought they were just protection spells, but now I'm not so sure.

TAG: Jasmine_023_f
I'll do more research. Whatever just happened, we can't stop it now. You need to take a break, {PlayerName}. I'll find you when I have more information.

TAG: Jasmine_027_f
The journal started to shudder!

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
I'm not surprised. There's a lot bottled up in this journal of yours.

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
I can see why you might feel that way.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
I'm sure that was very difficult.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
It certainly sounds like it.
