Jasmine! We've got the <ActivityItem>Alchemy Table</ActivityItem> all set up!

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Wonderful! I've been examining the <ActivityItem>Ancient Tome</ActivityItem>, and I think I know what we need to do to stop the Windcaller.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
The first thing we need is a <ActivityItem>Lamp</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Like... a magic genie lamp?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Shouldn't be a problem!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Please tell me this doesn't involve Jafar.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Well, something similar.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
If I'm right, we can create a lamp that will house the energy surrounding the Windcaller in the same way that a lamp contains a bound genie.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
All right, how do we craft it?

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Well, we'll need <ActivityItem>Gold Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
There was some that was going to be used to decorate the fountain, but the ingots got pulled into the winds and set down with the sandstone deposits.

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
If you can find <ActivityItem>Gold Shards</ActivityItem> and a mold we can pour the gold into, that should do the trick.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
I'm sure there's a <ActivityItem>Lamp Mold</ActivityItem> in the <Lore>Artisans' District</Lore>... though it may be buried under the sand.

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
All right, I can handle that â especially with the <ActivityItem>Protection Amulet</ActivityItem> that I made with Aladdin. And once I have the <ActivityItem>Lamp</ActivityItem> forged?

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
I'm still not sure. Why don't you come see me once you've made the Lamp, and I'll keep studying the <ActivityItem>Ancient Tome</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
Fabulous!

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Fortunately not!
