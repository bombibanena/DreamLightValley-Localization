I found this <ActivityItem>Envelope of Seeds</ActivityItem> in Merlin's library! Do they look familiar?

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
The seeds! Oh, I remember now! I asked Merlin to help me... There was something I needed to keep safe from harm.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What was it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What kind of harm?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Using flower pots and seeds...?

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
I can't remember that part, but I do know it was something important.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Something important?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How important could it be if you've forgotten about it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
And you really don't remember what it was?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Merlin mentioned something about this...

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
I'm not sure... It's just a feeling I have.

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
Hmm... Actually, Merlin mentioned something, as well.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
There was a secret hidden inside an Enchanted Flower. You must have been helping to protect this secret. I just wish you remembered what it was.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
So do I... But it's good to know we're on the right path. Did Merlin say what we should do next?

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
We need to <Lore>craft the Enchanted Pots of Blooming</Lore> and <Lore>gather the correct flowers</Lore> to plant in them.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Merlin said they needed to be carefully tended to, in order for the magic to work.

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
Well then, while you gather everything we need, I'll make some adjustments in my House so the environment's perfect for the flowers.

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
Sadly, no.

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
Merlin also couldn't remember details, but he did mention something...

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
Oh? What did he say?

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I'm not sure. I just know whatever the item was, it needed to be protected. So it must've been something important.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Yes, but not just any seeds and flower pots! There's magic embedded in them.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
I was trying to protect something important.
