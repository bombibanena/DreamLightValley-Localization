Jasmine! The Enchanted Flower is MISSING!

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
How is this possible?

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
I have no idea. Do you think someone stole it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That has to be it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No way! Who would do such a thing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I really don't know!

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
The flower certainly didn't grow legs and run out of here on its own!

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
But who would go to such lengths to steal an Enchanted Flower?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I bet it was Ursula.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Who other than Mother Gothel?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe Remy?

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
She probably took it to add it to a potion or something.

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
That does sound like something she might do.

TAG: Jasmine_019_f
Exactly! It has to be her!

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Maybe we should look for evidence before we make any accusations.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Okay, let's start by <Lore>searching the Plaza for clues</Lore>. We can work our way around from there!

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
I can't think of anyone else obsessed with flowers that possess magic, can you?

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
True, she DOES have a certain... history.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
I'm sure he didn't mean to steal it, but he's always looking for new ingredients to try in recipes.

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
And you think he wants to use the Enchanted Flower in some of his food?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Well, the flower DID look delicious... Don't you think?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I know flowers are sometimes used as ingredients.

TAG: Jasmine_020_f
Um...

TAG: Jasmine_021_f
True... like jasmine flowers.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I can't think of anyone who would steal an Enchanted Flower!

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Unless...

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
Unless what? Do you know who did this?

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
I can't imagine someone just stealing an Enchanted Flower like that...
