Jasmine, I'm trying to track down remnants of Aladdin's second wish.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
He was underwater when he made it, so I don't think I can really find any of the wish magic hanging around here. But, can you tell me any more about this fountain that you were building?

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Of course! There aren't many sources of fresh water nearby, so Genie used his magic to enchant a reservoir to change sea water to fresh water.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
The reservoir is almost full, but with the work on the fountain halted, we were never able to pump any water into Agrabah.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's quite the infrastructure project!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can you direct me to the reservoir?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What work is left on the fountain?

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Well, we have some very talented engineers here. And Genie, of course.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
If you can help us finish the work on the fountain, the water you need can be piped right to you!

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
We just have to <Lore>hook up the pipes</Lore>.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
It's just a short distance outside of Agrabah.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
It's nearly done!
