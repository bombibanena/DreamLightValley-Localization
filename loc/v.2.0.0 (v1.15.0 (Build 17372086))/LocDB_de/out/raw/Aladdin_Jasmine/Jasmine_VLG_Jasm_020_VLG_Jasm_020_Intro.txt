{PlayerName}, I was able to decrypt that strange code on the Secret Journal! I know what needs to be done next, but I could use your help. Do you have some time?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yes, of course!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe later.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
Wonderful!

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
Now, it turns out the code was actually a recipe to craft a key. It must be one of the keys to open the journal.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
The Ingredients indicate we should go to Dazzle Beach. Though, I don't completely understand them. Perhaps someone more familiar with beaches could help us.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I bet Moana can help guide us!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe Goofy?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Merlin usually knows everything!

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
I was thinking the same thing.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
There's also something about needing <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem>. I'm not familiar with those, but maybe she'll have some insight.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Okay, I'll go <Lore>talk to Moana</Lore> and see if she can help us make our <ActivityItem>Beach Key</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
Fabulous! In the meantime, I'll keep researching the Secret Journal.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
Good luck!

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Hmm... I'm not sure. We might end up fishing up a shoe or a fishing rod if we ask Goofy.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Maybe we should start with Moana, instead.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
That's true... but I think he'd just encourage us to speak to someone who's spent more time on a beach.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
I think we should ask Moana about these Ingredients.

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
All right. Just come and find me when you're ready.
