I'd love to explore more of the Valley.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
Where should I go, {PlayerName}? What would you say is the most interesting place in the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Peaceful Meadow.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Dazzle Beach!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Let me think of other options...

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
It's pretty in the Meadow, but it's not very exciting, is it?

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I want to go somewhere that says, "adventure!"

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
That's a wonderful idea. I do like it there. But even more than the beach, I adore the ocean!

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
You know, I'd never seen an ocean before I got here, except in paintings.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Rivers and lakes, yes. But nothing like the ocean. And it goes on forever.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The Dream Castle.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The Frosted Heights?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
The Glade of Trust!

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
The Castle IS interesting to explore â because it leads to so many worlds.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
I do wish I could go through those doors... Maybe someday?

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
The Frosted Heights are so beautiful! And so cold...

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Like night in the desert, but even colder â and all the time.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
I'd need to get warmer clothing before I go exploring there.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
The flowers in the Glade are very beautiful.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
But if I go there, I might have to talk to Mother Gothel.

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
She and I... don't see eye-to-eye on most things.
