Thank you so much for helping me free Aladdin!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Tell me about the Magic Carpet.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Tell me about the marketplace.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Tell me about the Windcaller.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Let's get to work!

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
There's still a lot of work to do in Agrabah, but now that there's three of us, I feel much better about our chances.

TAG: Jasmine_000_f
Hey Jasmine, can I ask you a question? Where's Genie?

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
How come he's not helping you with all this?

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
Unfortunately, he's still traveling. And we have no way to get in touch with him.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
Well, hopefully I can help a little in his place.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I'm not going to stop until Agrabah is back to normal and you two feel safe leaving the city as-is.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
So what's next?

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Well, we have to rescue the Magic Carpet as quickly as we can, then there are repairs needed in the marketplace, and of course, we need to figure out how to disable the Windcaller.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Oh, he got stuck in a flurry of winds surrounding the Windcaller.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
The winds there are so intense that poor Carpet hasn't been able to get free.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
We need to figure out a way to quell the winds and get him out.

TAG: Jasmine_020_f
Sounds tricky, but we can do this!

TAG: Jasmine_019_f
Yes! Now why don't you <Lore>talk to Aladdin</Lore>? I am sure he has some ideas about what we need to do to rescue Carpet.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
To put it simply, it's a mess.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
Most of the market stalls are broken, and some are covered in ruined produce.

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
Then there's the fountain. We never got to finish it.

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
As I said, we found it locked away in a vault under the city.

TAG: Jasmine_016_f
I suppose that means that people in the past had to deal with it too. We just need to figure out how!

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
If you and Aladdin <Lore>look in the South Market</Lore> for a clue, I'll keep looking here.

TAG: Jasmine_018_f
Hopefully, one of us can find a lead.
