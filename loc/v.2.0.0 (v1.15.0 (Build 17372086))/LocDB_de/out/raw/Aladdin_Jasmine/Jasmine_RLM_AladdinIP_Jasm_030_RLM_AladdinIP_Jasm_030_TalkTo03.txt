There's just one wish left to track down, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
Yeah! What can you tell me about Aladdin's last wish?

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
The wish that freed Genie...

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
You know if I hadn't already fallen in love with Aladdin, such a selfless act would have made me do so immediately.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Genie deserved his freedom!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Poor Genie had to have been waiting for so long...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I wonder where Genie is vacationing now.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
He did! After waiting for so long...

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
He was so happy that as he flew around, he created these lovely lights â almost like the fireworks I saw with Aladdin when we went on our magic carpet ride.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Then the lights became these amazing sparks that we used to make our own fireworks â they made the most fabulous colors in the sky!

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
We called it <ActivityItem>Genie's Joy</ActivityItem>. I know we didn't use them all. If you can find some, I'm sure we can use them to enchant the lamp.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Yes. Thousands of years.

I suspect someplace far away. The clothes he conjured for himself were unlike any I'd ever seen.
