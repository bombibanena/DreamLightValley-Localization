We met in the marketplace in Agrabah. I took an apple and gave it to a little boy.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
The owner of the apple stall got angry with me and said I was stealing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That was kind of you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I guess you technically broke a law...

How did Aladdin come into it?

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
The boy was hungry â I had to do something! But... it was also a mistake. I know that now.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I'm very lucky that Aladdin intervened.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
He distracted the stall owner.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
He made up a story that was pretty silly but the gentleman believed him.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That was really clever!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
He's a quick thinker!

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
I thought so too.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
He is. Aladdin learned so much growing up on the streets of Agrabah.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
I've learned a lot from him.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
And he learns from me too. I think we have a good balance.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
I did. And I know that now. But it's wrong for people to go hungry while others have so much. Father and I are working to change that.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Oh, that's my favorite part...
