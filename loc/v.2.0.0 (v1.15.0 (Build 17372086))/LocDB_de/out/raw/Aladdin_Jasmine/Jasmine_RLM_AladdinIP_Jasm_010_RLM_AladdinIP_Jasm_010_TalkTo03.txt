<ActivityItem>Artisans' Alloy</ActivityItem> acquired!

TAG: Jasmine_002_f
Oh, that's wonderful! I hope the adjustments you make to your Pickaxe work.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
I'm getting rather worried about Aladdin. We need to find him.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Do you have any idea what we might run into as we keep searching?

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Unfortunately, I don't... I haven't been able to see what's beyond the marketplace gates for a while now.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
I suppose we should be ready for anything. I think we'll have to <Lore>avoid dust devils, break down more sandstone, and use planks to get across the rooftops</Lore>, at the very least.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds tricky...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I won't be stopped!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll do my best.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Perhaps. But I'm sure we can do it, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Well, I'll get started on <Lore>crafting the upgrade for my Pickaxe</Lore>, and then let's try to find Aladdin!

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
And neither will I!

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
That's all I can ask for. You've already been so helpful.
