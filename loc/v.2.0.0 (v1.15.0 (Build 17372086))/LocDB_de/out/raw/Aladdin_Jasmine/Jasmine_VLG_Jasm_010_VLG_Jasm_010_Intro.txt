Oh {PlayerName}, I'm so glad you're here! I found the oddest note in my House. Do you have a moment to help me figure out what it means?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd be happy to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe another time.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
The note was at the very back of a drawer. It's clearly written in my handwriting, but I have no memory of it.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Must have been before the Forgetting...

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
That's what I thought. The note contains instructions for how to make "Enchanted Pots of Blooming." But I have no idea what the pots are meant to be used for.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Hmm... That IS strange.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe they'll grow something magical!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
They're probably just regular flower pots... but fancy.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Isn't it?

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
Looking at the instructions, they wouldn't be just regular flower or vegetable pots.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
Whatever it is, we'll figure it out! We just need to decide where to start looking.

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
Hmm... I used to spend a lot of time researching with Merlin. He always had the most fascinating puzzles to solve. Maybe he knows something about this.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
That's a great hunch. I'll go <Lore>talk to Merlin and see what he knows</Lore>. You should keep looking around your House, and maybe see if anything jogs your memory!

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
I will! Thank you, {PlayerName}. I'm certainly looking forward to getting to the bottom of this.

TAG: Jasmine_009_f
I suppose it's possible.

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
Hmm... I don't think so.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
I understand. We can talk about it later.
