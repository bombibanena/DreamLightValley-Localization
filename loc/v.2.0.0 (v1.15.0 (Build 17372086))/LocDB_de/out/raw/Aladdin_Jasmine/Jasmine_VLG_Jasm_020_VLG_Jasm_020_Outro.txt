It worked! We unlocked one lock.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
Jasmine, I...

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
{PlayerName}? Are you all right?

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
I know what this is... This is MY journal... I wrote in it when I was younger.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I can't believe it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I had a feeling this was mine...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Did you know?

TAG: Jasmine_010_f
I completely forgot about this thing.

TAG: Jasmine_014_f
So all this time, it was YOUR secret I was trying to protect?

TAG: Jasmine_015_f
I guess so. You truly don't remember what the secret inside is?

TAG: Jasmine_019_f
I'm sorry, but no.

TAG: Jasmine_020_f
I remember you asked for my help. Whatever you wrote in the journal, you wanted it hidden away.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I was hiding my own feelings from... myself?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm sure I had a good reason.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What if I did something terrible?

TAG: Jasmine_024_f
That doesn't sound so strange to me.

TAG: Jasmine_021_f
Sometimes, when we feel things very strongly, it's easier to lock the feelings away rather than face them.

TAG: Jasmine_025_f
What do you think we should do now? I want to know what I wrote... at least, I think I want to know... but there's still another lock.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
Let me take some time to examine the Secret Journal a bit more. Maybe there's a hint we're missing.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
That's a good idea. Thanks for everything, Jasmine. We make a pretty amazing team.

TAG: Jasmine_022_f
I'm sure you did, too.

TAG: Jasmine_023_f
Knowing you, that's not possible. I think this is less about what you did and more about how you felt.

TAG: Jasmine_011_f
How I felt when we first found it was so familiar.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
No! I promise I couldn't remember.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
But now that you've told me, bits and pieces are starting to come back. You asked me to hide it. To protect it.

TAG: Jasmine_017_f
So do you know what the secret inside is?
