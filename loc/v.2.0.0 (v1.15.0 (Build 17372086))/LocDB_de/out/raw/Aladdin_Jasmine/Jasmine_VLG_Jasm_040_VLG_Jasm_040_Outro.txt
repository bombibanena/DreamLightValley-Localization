Well, we did it, {PlayerName}. We opened up the Secret Journal and contained the wish magic.

Not only that, I also learned...

...it's important to take care of my own needs.

...I shouldn't lock away my past pain.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...it's okay to do what I want sometimes.

TAG: Jasmine_003_f
Yes, that is SO important! You deserve care, {PlayerName}. Please don't ever forget that. You know, I think I understand now why you gave the journal to ME to protect.

TAG: Jasmine_006_f
You should hold on to the journal.

TAG: Jasmine_012_f
I'm certain it's one of the Mementos you've been searching for.

TAG: Jasmine_013_f
My youthful angst and wishful thinking trapped in a book. No wonder I had TWO locks on there.

TAG: Jasmine_007_f
Thank you, Jasmine. This journal is a part of me, a part of my history... It means a lot to have it.

TAG: Jasmine_008_f
Oh! I have one last thing to give you. I've so loved spending this time with you, I wanted to give you something as a token of our friendship.

TAG: Jasmine_001_f
The journal... Wow, looking at it makes me feel... a lot of things.

TAG: Jasmine_004_f
That's true! We can learn a lot from our past struggles.

TAG: Jasmine_005_f
Absolutely! As a matter of fact, I think it's important that you do just that.
