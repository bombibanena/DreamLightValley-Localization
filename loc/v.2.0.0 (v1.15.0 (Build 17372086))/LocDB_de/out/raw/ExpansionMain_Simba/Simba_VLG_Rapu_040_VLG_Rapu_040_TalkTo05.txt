This paint is different from the pigments my friend Rafiki has, and I can't use brushes, but I'm gonna work with what I've got.

Like Timon and Pumbaa say, "Hakuna Matata"!

TAG: Simba_002_f
Hey! Not too bad, right?

I love it â so creative!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This is the ESSENCE of hakuna matata.

Did you boop the canvas with your nose?

TAG: Simba_003_f
Really? You do?

TAG: Simba_004_f
Of course! I'm not LION to you!

TAG: Simba_005_f
What? Oh! Ha-ha. Good one.

Skipping the brushes was a bold choice, and the colors are so expressive.

TAG: Simba_007_f
Thanks. I think I could get into this painting stuff. Maybe it's something Nala and I could do together.

Well, Rapunzel said it's important for an artist to sign their work.

That is true... and adorable.
