OK Gaston, we're all done!

TAG: Gaston_001_f
What did you think of our performances?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
Well, I wouldn't consider EITHER of your actions up to my standards...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm not surprised...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What?! But I worked so hard!

TAG: Gaston_003_f
Of course, the standards I set for myself would be impossible for you.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Still, since I'M not competing, I suppose I must pick a winner between the two of you.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
And one of you CLEARLY came out on top.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
That contestant is... {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
YES!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sorry, Oswald...

TAG: Gaston_008_f
While I must admit I winced at every swing of your Pickaxe...

TAG: Gaston_009_f
...you at least TRIED to use your strength for the task I set.

TAG: Gaston_010_f
The rabbit just... used some sort of strange sorcery.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
It's clear that you "won." Although the real winner is ME, for being a fair judge of this sad display.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Gee... Thanks for being a judge, Gaston.

TAG: Gaston_004_f
You did. What a pity.
