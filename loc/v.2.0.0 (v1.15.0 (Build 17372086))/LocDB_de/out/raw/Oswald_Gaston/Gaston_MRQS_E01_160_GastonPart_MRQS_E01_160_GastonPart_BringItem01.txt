Ah, now THIS is a breakfast worthy of me!

Though I've been thinking, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You of all people should know that's dangerous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You? Thinking? That's weird.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Thinking about what?

TAG: Gaston_002_f
It has been in the past, but not today!

You see, if you're expecting me to pose heroically, then I'll need a sidekick posing beside me. There were TWO platforms in that picture you showed me.

TAG: Gaston_007_f
No problem. I'll go get Olaf.

TAG: Gaston_008_f
Ugh. No! That puny little snowman is becoming bothersome.

TAG: Gaston_009_f
Why, just yesterday, he asked me if I knew that "Gaston" only needed a few letters to become a mixed-up version of "Antagonist"?

TAG: Gaston_010_f
I told him I had no time for anything involving spelling and to get out of my sight!

TAG: Gaston_015_f
There's only one sidekick for the job â a new and improved LeFou. A SHINIER LeFou!

I made the last one out of coconuts. But YOU could make one more fitting my impressiveness with some precious gems from around the Isle.

<ActivityItem>Bronze Ingots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Bumblestones</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Alexandrite</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Spinel</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Jade</ActivityItem> ought to do nicely.

TAG: Gaston_005_f
Of course, you might need some <ActivityItem>Paint</ActivityItem> to finish it.

TAG: Gaston_006_f
No problem. Rapunzel told me I could always <Lore>borrow some from her tower</Lore>.

TAG: Gaston_011_f
No problem. I'll go get Stitch.

TAG: Gaston_012_f
Ugh! No! I've had quite enough of that little blue beast.

TAG: Gaston_013_f
Why, just yesterday he told me that I needed to work on my "goodness levels." Ridiculous!

TAG: Gaston_014_f
There's no one gooder than me.

TAG: Gaston_003_f
It's boring work, but I'm afraid it must be done on occasion.
