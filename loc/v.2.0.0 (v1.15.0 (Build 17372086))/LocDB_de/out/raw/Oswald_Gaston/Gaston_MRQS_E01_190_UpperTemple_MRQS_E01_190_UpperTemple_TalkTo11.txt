{PlayerName}, something is not quite right here.

First, no one is singing songs of praise about my many heroic deeds.

Less importantly, a number of things are turning black and white.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Glad to see your priorities are in order.

It's all Jafar's doing.

Trust me, {PlayerName}, if there's something nefarious afoot, you want your heroes to feel appreciated.

I'll keep an eye out for any more evil doings.

Ah-ha! I knew the Mirage Wizard had to be behind all this.
