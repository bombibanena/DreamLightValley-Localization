Now, I think I remember who used to drink which tea...

TAG: Mulan_003_f
Merlin likes <ActivityItem>Chrysanthemum Tea</ActivityItem> because it's floral and calming.

TAG: Mulan_000_f
Mirabel likes <ActivityItem>Oolong Tea</ActivityItem> for its strong flavor and because it can be very energizing.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
And Mr. McDuck likes the finest <ActivityItem>Jasmine Tea</ActivityItem> both for the quality and the delicate taste.
