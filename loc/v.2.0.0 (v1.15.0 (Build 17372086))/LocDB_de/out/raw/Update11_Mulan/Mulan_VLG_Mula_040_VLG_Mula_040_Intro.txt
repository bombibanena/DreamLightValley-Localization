Hey, {PlayerName}! Would you like to join some other Villagers and me for a fun competition?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I volunteer!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe later.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Great! I've been keeping up with my daily regime, and some other Villagers have joined in!

TAG: Mulan_006_f
We've even started training together. This morning, we were discussing how teamwork is crucial to success. Mother Gothel overheard and started to laugh at us.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
She said that the only person you can truly depend on for success is yourself.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That sounds like her.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Mother Gothel works out?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
She has a point.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
I challenged her to a contest. My team against her, alone, in a "capture the flag" style competition.

TAG: Mulan_011_f
Would you like to be on my team?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Of course, I love teamwork!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sure, but for fun. Not competition.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Yep. Mother Gothel needs a reality check.

TAG: Mulan_015_f
Great!

TAG: Mulan_013_f
You should probably tell Mother Gothel you've joined us. I don't want her to be surprised.

TAG: Mulan_014_f
I'm headed to my tactical table to make a plan. See you soon!

TAG: Mulan_000_f
That's totally fine. I'm glad to have you on my team.

TAG: Mulan_002_f
Maybe just a lesson in being humble?

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Not with us, but I guess she has some sort of routine. I know I see her walking a lot.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
I don't agree. There are some things a lone defender can do on their own, but I believe in the strength of many working together.

TAG: Mulan_005_f
Okay. I hope you come back soon!
