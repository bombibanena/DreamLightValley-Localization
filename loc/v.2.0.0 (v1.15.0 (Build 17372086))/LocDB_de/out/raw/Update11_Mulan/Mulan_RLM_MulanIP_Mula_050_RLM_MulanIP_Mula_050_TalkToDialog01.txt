Welcome to the Training Maze. Before you start, I need to give you something.

Here.

What is that?

TAG: Mulan_004_f
<ActivityItem>Training Weights</ActivityItem>. They're roughly the weight of your pack when you walk.

I hope you didn't expect to walk through the maze carrying nothing. That would've been much too easy.

I laugh in the face of your challenge.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm prepared for anything!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
My back is already hurting just seeing those.

Don't be too confident, {PlayerName}. That just might be your downfall.

Put the weights on, open the door, and come talk to me. I'll explain the rest of your goals for this exercise then.

TAG: Mulan_007_f
Thinking like a defender already. I like that.

Well, don't forget to stretch afterwards. It helps.
