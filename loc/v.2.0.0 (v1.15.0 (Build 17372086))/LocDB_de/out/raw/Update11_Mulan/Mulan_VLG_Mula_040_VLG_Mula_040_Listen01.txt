There's no need to make such a display of your victory.

TAG: Mulan_003_f
You win... I concede.

TAG: Mulan_004_f
Even though you cheated.

TAG: Mulan_005_f

Well, did you need a team? Or just {PlayerName} to secure your victory?

TAG: Mulan_007_f
{PlayerName} is a great leader, but my entire team did their part.

TAG: Mulan_008_f
That's the thing about working together. You can play to everyone's strengths.

TAG: Mulan_009_f
Hmph. If you say so.
