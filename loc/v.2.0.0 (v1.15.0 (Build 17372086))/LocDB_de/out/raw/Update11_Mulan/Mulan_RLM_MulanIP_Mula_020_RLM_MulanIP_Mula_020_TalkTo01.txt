{PlayerName}, the road and the river look great. Thank you!

I noticed a lot of damage and weak points in the perimeter. The camp is not prepared for another landslide.

TAG: Mulan_006_f
I'd like to make sure it doesn't happen again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's a great idea.

Where should we start?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you sure it's necessary?

TAG: Mulan_007_f
I'm glad you agree.

Let's plant some <ActivityItem>Trees</ActivityItem> to repair some of the damage from the landslide.

TAG: Mulan_000_f
I'm gonna dig some holes for the seeds and let you take care of the actual planting. I'm not much of a gardener.

TAG: Mulan_010_f
Here are some <ActivityItem>Tree Seeds</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mulan_011_f
All right, I'll <Lore>handle the planting and the watering</Lore>!

As Captain Shang says, "better to be over-prepared than under the heel of your problem."
