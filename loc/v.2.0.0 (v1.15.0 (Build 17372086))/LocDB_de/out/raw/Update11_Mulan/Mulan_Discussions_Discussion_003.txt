Fulfill your duties calmly and respectfully...

TAG: Mulan_020_f
Oh! {PlayerName}! Ha, I was just trying to recite something I memorized back home.

TAG: Mulan_001_f
Are you good at memorizing things?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm... okay at it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm terrible at memorizing things!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I've never forgotten anything, ever.

TAG: Mulan_016_f
My friend Chien-Po told me that if you need help memorizing a list of things, imagine them each associated with one finger.

TAG: Mulan_018_f
C'mon, let's try a memory game!

TAG: Mulan_021_f
I'll say three words, and you say them back to me.

TAG: Mulan_022_f
Honor.

TAG: Mulan_023_f
Mushu.

TAG: Mulan_024_f
Magnolia.

TAG: Mulan_026_f
Got it?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Honor. Discipline. Chrysanthemum.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Honor. Mushu. Magnolia.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Patience. Mushu. Magnolia.

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
I already forgot what you said!

TAG: Mulan_028_f
Not quite! Maybe we could try again sometime.

TAG: Mulan_027_f
That's right! I'll have to challenge you with more words next time.

TAG: Mulan_029_f
So close. Just one word off!

TAG: Mulan_030_f
That's all right. Maybe we could try again sometime.

TAG: Mulan_015_f
It's not my greatest strength, either. I used to put notes on my arm in ink just in case. But it's good to practice.

TAG: Mulan_017_f
Really? That's impressive.
