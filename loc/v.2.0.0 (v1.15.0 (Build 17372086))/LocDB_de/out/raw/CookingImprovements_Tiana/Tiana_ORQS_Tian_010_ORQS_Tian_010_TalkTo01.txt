{PlayerName}, you're just who I was thinking about!

Seems that you and I used to prepare loads of dishes in <Lore>large batches</Lore> with this machine.

All you need to do is choose the recipe and add the Ingredients! It'll take some time, but that just means you can do other things while you wait.

Now, I'm sure you can <Lore>build one yourself</Lore> with things found right here in the Valley.

TAG: Tiana_008_f
I'll give you the list for what you'll need and <Lore>my famous Gumbo recipe</Lore> for you to try out when the Slow Cooker is finished.
