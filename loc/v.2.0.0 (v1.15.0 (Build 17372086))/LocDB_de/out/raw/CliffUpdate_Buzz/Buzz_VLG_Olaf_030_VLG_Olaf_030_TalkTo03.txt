You want me to audition for a play? Hmm...

TAG: Buzz_009_f
"I am Donald Duck."

TAG: Player_000_f
Uh... could you try it with a little more...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...emotion?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...energy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...Donald Duck-ishness?

TAG: Buzz_001_f
What's the role?

TAG: Buzz_002_f
Donald Duck. We thought you could pull off the bravery and heroism needed for the part.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Why, um... thank you. I'm flattered.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Perhaps I should audition for you right now.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Uh... okay, but it's actually Olaf who you need toâ

TAG: Buzz_006_f
Ahem, ahem. Just getting into character.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
"Hello there."

TAG: Buzz_008_f
"..."

TAG: Buzz_010_f
Of course. Let me take it again from the top...

TAG: Buzz_011_f
"HELLO THERE!!!"

TAG: Buzz_012_f
"I..."

TAG: Buzz_013_f
"...AM DONALD..."

TAG: Buzz_014_f
"...DUCK!!!"

TAG: Player_001_f
Uh...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I think we're going in a different direction.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Thanks! Bye! We'll let you know if you got it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Your talents would be wasted on local theater.

TAG: Buzz_015_f
Of course. I... I understand. Let me know if there's another role that might be better suited to my talents as a thespian.

TAG: Buzz_016_f
Roger that. And thank you for your direction. You, my friend, are a real professional.

TAG: Buzz_017_f
You really think so? Thanks, {PlayerName}!
