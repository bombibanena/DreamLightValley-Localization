Boom, look at that successful setup!

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Yes, I am quite pleased.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
You are nearly as efficient an assistant as Iago.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
At least I have opposable thumbs.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you calling me bird-brained?

TAG: Jafar_007_f
True. Yet it is remarkable what Iago can accomplish without them.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
You should be able to use the <ActivityItem>Geometrically Repaired Objects</ActivityItem> to return the planar topography to its expected dimensions.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
However, I suspect that you may need to experiment with the placement. My analysis was unable to determine the exact configuration required to solve this once and for all.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How did you get so good at geometry?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Great, on it!

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Okay, well are we going to fix this problem, or did you just want to be mean and then go back in the lamp?

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Let us not be hasty â much work remains.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
That's what I thought.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
My research has uncovered a worrying fact.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
The objects we have repaired may only be a symptom of a flattening plague affecting the entire Isle.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Oh... that doesn't sound good.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Indeed, but with my help it can be stopped.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
In addition to my knowledge of the arcane, I also possess an endless well of more mundane knowledge. That is... of the natural world.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
Agrabah has long been a center of learning, and I have studied the works of all its best mathematical minds.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
I doubt you would have heard of any of them.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I dunno; try me!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Yeah, math isn't my strong suit.

TAG: Jafar_020_f
Another time. I presume you have more pressing matters to attend to?

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Okay, Jafar. Be that way. I'm off to try and fix things for good. Hope your geometry skills were enough to settle this!

TAG: Jafar_025_f
Trust me, {PlayerName}... they are.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
One wonders if you possess suits of any strength.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
You're trying to insult me?

TAG: Jafar_023_f
I am not trying. I am succeeding.

TAG: Jafar_026_f
Hope your geometry skills were good enough to do the trick here...

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Hardly. I would not wish to insult my feathered friends.
