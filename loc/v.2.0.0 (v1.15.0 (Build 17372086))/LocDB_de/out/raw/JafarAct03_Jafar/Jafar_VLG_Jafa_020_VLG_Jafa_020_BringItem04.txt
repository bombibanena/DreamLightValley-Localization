What?! This is not the Gilded Stone! This is nothing more than a common <ActivityItem>Stone of Creativity</ActivityItem>. It is as powerless as a paperweight!

TAG: Jafar_003_f
I must think... Where did the calculations fail?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Do we need additional essences? Perhaps a type of refined gold?

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Hurry, {PlayerName} â back to EVE! We need more Iron Dust!

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Whoa, hold up, Jafar. I have an idea to fix this.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
You? You would deign to educate ME on alchemy?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
May I remind you that I have spent years studying the works of the greatest alchemical minds? I have spent even longer searching for rare components and performing rigorous experiments.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
But please, go on, {PlayerName}; what revelation have you for me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No need to be so mean about it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, your knowledge is clearly working here...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Never mind; you can figure this out yourself.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
I... I... apologize, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
Emotive Essences? You have not mentioned them thus far.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
We were so close. I seem to have gotten carried away.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Please, go on.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Well, you said alchemy is about the secret rules of the universe, right?

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Indeed. I am pleased that you were paying attention.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Well, maybe that's the problem â we're using Dreamlight Valley resources, but we're still using the rules you learned back in Agrabah.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
That... that...

TAG: Jafar_019_f
...that is quite sensible. What would you suggest?

TAG: Jafar_020_f
I was told there were two special <ActivityItem>Emotive Essences</ActivityItem>. Let me try and track them down... Maybe if we combine them with this stone we'll get somewhere!

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Oh yeah, the Fairy Godmother told me about them when I was tracking down info on the Minor Essences.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
The Emotive Essences are super rare! You need to call them out of Dreamlight by performing certain actions.

TAG: Jafar_023_f
I think it was the <ActivityItem>Essence of Benevolence</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Essence of Wisdom</ActivityItem> that I heard about. I'll try to get ahold of those.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
Hmm... interesting. It is certainly worth an attempt. I shall be here when you return.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Jack Skellington filled me in about how they work!

TAG: Jafar_025_f
Ursula told me all about them... in exchange for that favor from you.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
*sigh* I see your point.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
No! Wait!
