{PlayerName}! I have news for you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Great! Did you figure out our geometric issue?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Hold on; I'm busy now.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
I have!

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Clearly something is wrong with the dimensionality of these objects.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
But rather than being simply ripped away, the dimensions have been folded down...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Fascinating!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Skip the technical talk please.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
I must admit, I am surprised that you appreciate the finer details of geometry. Now...

TAG: Jafar_015_f
All right, fine; I'll be back soon enough. Merlin is going to keep an eye on you.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
If I am correct â and I most certainly am â I know what is needed to resolve this situation.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
However, it will not be simple.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
All right, what do you need?

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Supplies, to begin with. <ActivityItem>Levers</ActivityItem>, a <ActivityItem>Mirror</ActivityItem> from the <Lore>Cave of Wonders</Lore>, and <ActivityItem>Power Cables</ActivityItem> from EVE's House.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
And after that... I will inform you of what to do next.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
You can't just tell me now? You're kinda on thin ice.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Now, now, why would I tell you everything just to be rudely thrown back in a lamp?

TAG: Jafar_014_f
All in due time.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Of course. I would not expect you to understand.
