Take a look, Jafar. I think we're getting somewhere!

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Yes! Excellent work.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
The Gilded Stone is nearly within my grasp!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
"Our" grasp, Jafar.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
This alchemy is kinda fun...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What are you planning with it?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Yes, yes, I could not do it without you, and all that.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
That didn't seem very sincere.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Please do not take it personally, {PlayerName}. I am merely consumed with the spirit of alchemical inquiry.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Let us not waste any more time. The Stone awaits us!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
All right, here goes!

TAG: Jafar_005_f
"Fun"? {PlayerName}, we are uncovering the secrets of the universe. Our work is far more profound than the simple pursuit of "fun."

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Okay, okay, calm down.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Better to ask what I am NOT planning with it!

TAG: Jafar_000_f
Excuse me?! I don't like the sound of that.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Pardon me, {PlayerName}. I merely meant to express how the possibilities are endless when you have as much gold as the Gilded Stone is capable of creating.
