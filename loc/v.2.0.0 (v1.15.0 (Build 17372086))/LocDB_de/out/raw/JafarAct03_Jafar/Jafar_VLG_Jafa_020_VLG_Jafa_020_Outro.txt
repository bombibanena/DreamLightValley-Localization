Okay Jafar, we've got the <ActivityItem>Stone of Creativity</ActivityItem>, and we've got the additional essences. Are you satisfied with your alchemical experiment now?

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Just a moment, {PlayerName}. Allow me to combine them all...

TAG: Jafar_006_f
This... this is not the stone I wanted!

TAG: Jafar_007_f
What? You didn't get the Gilded Stone? What did that do?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
It... This is most disagreeable.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
The stone is clearly activated. I feel it summoning... emotions within me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The horror!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Which emotions?

TAG: Jafar_010_f
I see â your response to having been taught a Secret Science is to engage in mockery.

TAG: Jafar_000_f
Hmm, now that I consider the matter more fully...

TAG: Jafar_020_f
I have learned much from this failure. And there is much that I may now attempt in the future.

TAG: Jafar_001_f
Yes, I believe I may find a use for this stone after all!

TAG: Jafar_021_f
Well, that's good to hear! What kind of stuff?

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Oh, I will be sure to contact you anew should I require more assistance. But rest assured, it will be for the good of the Valley...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Good to hear!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Okay...

TAG: Jafar_011_f
I'm sorry, Jafar; I guess I don't feel like emotions are particularly horrible.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
I feel... joy. Joy and compassion.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
Oh, that's not too bad then!

TAG: Jafar_014_f
These are entirely inappropriate emotions for my current state of mind.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Compassion is a distraction. And joy... About what do I have to feel joyful?

TAG: Jafar_016_f
No, I can feel the stone working its way into my mind like a parasite.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Perhaps you would be more suited to such an artifact, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
I don't know â maybe it would be good for you to keep this on you!

TAG: Jafar_023_f
Until next time, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
That's somewhat ominous.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
My apologies, {PlayerName}; I may have grown unused to speaking with others during my imprisonment. Rest assured: I have everyone's best interests at heart.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
In truth, I find failure helpful as then I must reflect on what is necessary to achieve greatness.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
I shall keep the stone as a reminder that science is often a process of learning from one's mistakes.

TAG: Jafar_026_f
If you say so...
