AT LAST! I am free! The spell worked! Now to seek revenâ Oh. Hello.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Hello. What spell are you talking about? Were you using magic to try and escape?

TAG: Jafar_003_f
What I was or was not doing in the prison you banished me to is between myself and the lamp.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
I'll take that as a yes. Listen, Jafar; we need to talk.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Clearly you freed me for a reason. Pray tell, {PlayerName}, what catastrophe has befallen you for which I am your last resort?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Wow, that was quick.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We didn't have enough snarky people around.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
My time of imprisonment has not diminished my mental acuity.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Ah yes. Well, seeing as I have few choices at present, I accept.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
I will require some time to study the problem, but I will inform you the moment I understand the nature of this anomaly.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Perfect. And Jafar?

TAG: Jafar_020_f
Yes?

TAG: Jafar_021_f
Don't get any ideas â I've got my eye on you.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
I would not expect otherwise, {PlayerName}. Now if you will excuse me, I have work to do.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I found some strange two-dimensional objects around Eternity Isle.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
You did, did you? Now, this is interesting...

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Oswald did... something. We need your help fixing it.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
I see. And how will this endeavor benefit me?

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Consider this a shot at a second chance, Jafar.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
If you can put aside your evil and do something for the good of Eternity Isle, I might be inclined to let you stay out of the lamp.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
And if not?

TAG: Jafar_016_f
I've defeated you once before, and I can do it again.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
I see. You have freed me merely to engage in mockery.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
No, you're right. I need something.
