All right Jafar, how are you feeling after that?

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Feeding the cobra was almost pleasant.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
But there was a disappointing aura of Dreamlight "cuteness" around the reptile that I found insulting to its natural dignity.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Hey, snakes can be cute!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Well, happy that you enjoyed it somewhat.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
Just because one can do something does not mean one should.

TAG: Jafar_014_f
And overall? How do you feel?

TAG: Jafar_015_f
I suppose a bit nostalgic... I find myself recalling fondly the afternoon I acquired Iago.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Such glorious days, {PlayerName}. I had dozens of nascent plots, just waiting to be enacted.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
The Sultan, doing my bidding. Iago, on my shoulder offering the cutting commentary my lessers so deserved. Those were marvelous times, before things became... complicated.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I guess that remembering your friendship with Iago is a positive thing...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's not very nice...

TAG: Jafar_006_f
How about the monkey?

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Less pleasant.

TAG: Jafar_008_f
Oh? Why is that?

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I suppose it brought up too many memories. Memories of that street rat and his thieving simian companion.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Fair enough; we all have different associations with different animals. And the capybaras?

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Strange creatures. Their placidity is... uncanny.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
They seem to remain consistently unbothered by whatever occurs around them.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
I would hesitate to describe it as "friendship," but yes, that was a pleasant reminiscence.

TAG: Jafar_021_f
Now, have my actions been sufficient to satisfy the service to the community that you demand?

TAG: Jafar_022_f
Pretty much! There's just one last thing, but I need to talk to the other Villagers. I'll be back soon enough.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Very well.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
{PlayerName}, have I ever claimed to be "nice"?

TAG: Jafar_020_f
No, I suppose you haven't.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Well, I do have an affinity for them.
