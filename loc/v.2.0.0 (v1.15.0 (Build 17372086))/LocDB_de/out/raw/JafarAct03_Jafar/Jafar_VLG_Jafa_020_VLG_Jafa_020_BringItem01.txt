I made some gold! Check it out!

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Hmm, I see...

TAG: Jafar_007_f
Pretty cool, huh?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
That is one perspective.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
Personally, I find the pitiful yield of gold rendered from the process unsatisfactory.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, it is kinda tiny.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What?! We got GOLD from IRON!

TAG: Jafar_012_f
Where did we go wrong?

TAG: Jafar_013_f
According to my calculations, we should have gained a 1-to-1 yield. If that is incorrect, this does not bode well for making the stone...

TAG: Jafar_014_f
Hmm, maybe alchemy works differently in Dreamlight Valley?

TAG: Jafar_015_f
I am... impressed, {PlayerName}. That is quite a well-reasoned suggestion.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Guess I'm more than an assistant!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why, thank you.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're not the only smarty-pants around here!

TAG: Jafar_011_f
I would not go so far.

TAG: Jafar_029_f
Cool, talk to you soon.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
Dreamlight Alchemy... now that is an interesting proposition.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
But it does somewhat invalidate my prior research... If we want to make the Gilded Stone, we will need more information... but from whom?

TAG: Jafar_023_f
Well, you're not the only one interested in potions and alchemy here.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Oh? Do go on.

TAG: Jafar_025_f
<Lore>Jack Skellington</Lore> is an amateur alchemist as well! <Lore>Ursula</Lore> regularly works with potions, and <Lore>the Fairy Godmother</Lore> is something of an expert on the magic here!

TAG: Jafar_026_f
What if I go and get some advice from them?

TAG: Jafar_027_f
That would be... most appreciated.

TAG: Jafar_028_f
In the meantime, I will test a hypothesis I have recently formed.

TAG: Jafar_018_f
You are most welcome.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
Perhaps the alchemy has also infused your head with vast quantities of hot air. That aside...

TAG: Jafar_010_f
Yes, though a trifling amount of it.
