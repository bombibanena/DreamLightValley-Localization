{PlayerName}, I am unsure of how to respond to all this pageantry.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
You don't have to respond any particular way at all!

TAG: Jafar_003_f
We recognized that you were making an effort to be nice to the other Villagers, so we wanted to give something to you too.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
You're a citizen like everyone else now. You can just be yourself and relax!

TAG: Jafar_005_f
I am... unused to such treatment. Had the Sultan recognized me like this, perhaps I would have reconsidered my actions.

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Well, this is the vibe I'm trying to cultivate here. And I have to admit...

TAG: Jafar_008_f
...I wanted to think the best of you, and you proved me right.

TAG: Jafar_017_f
Hmm, yeah, well if they do...

TAG: Jafar_018_f
...I'll still be here, ready to stop your plots before they even get going.

TAG: Jafar_019_f
I would not expect anything less of you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I'm glad that we were able to get you to make amends with everyone and settle in properly.

TAG: Jafar_011_f
Well, when the choice was between biting my tongue for a time or going back into the lamp...

TAG: Jafar_012_f
...the choice was clear.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
"Biting your tongue"? Jafar, are you saying that you still have plots brewing?

TAG: Jafar_014_f
I said nothing of the sort.

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Well, I guess that's as good as I can get with you, isn't it?

TAG: Jafar_020_f
{PlayerName}, you truly are my most competent adversary, and for that, you have my respect.

TAG: Jafar_016_f
I cannot be but myself. One can only hope that does not put us at odds again.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
...I thought you were up to something, but I've never been happier to be proven wrong.
