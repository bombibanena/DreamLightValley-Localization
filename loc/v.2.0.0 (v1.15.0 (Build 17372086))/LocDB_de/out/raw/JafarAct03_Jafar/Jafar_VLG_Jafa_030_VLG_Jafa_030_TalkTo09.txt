Hey Jafar, got a moment?

TAG: Jafar_009_f
I have been hard at work here. That automaton simply has it out for me.

TAG: Jafar_010_f
EVE? Really?

TAG: Jafar_011_f
It is understandable â not everyone here shares your perspicacious outlook.

TAG: Jafar_012_f
I would imagine that she simply needs more time to see the truth of my changed nature.

TAG: Jafar_013_f
But please, do not chastise her on my behalf. I am sure she is simply working with the good of the Isle at heart â despite her lack thereof.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Hmm, that's very forgiving of you, Jafar.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're up to something; I know it!

TAG: Jafar_001_f
I am rather consumed by my work at the moment.

TAG: Jafar_002_f
Well, there's something really strange going on.

TAG: Jafar_003_f
Oswald is feeling sick, and some of the Villagers are acting very unlike their regular selves.

TAG: Jafar_004_f
How unfortunate.

TAG: Jafar_005_f
Yeah... Do you know anything about it?

TAG: Jafar_006_f
Alas, I do not. I have been hard at work in my laboratory. I am afraid I know little of the goings-on of the rest of the Island.

TAG: Jafar_007_f
You sure? EVE mentioned that you planted... or gave something to people?

TAG: Jafar_008_f
That is utterly preposterous!

TAG: Jafar_015_f
Yes, it seems that compassion is in the very air here.

TAG: Jafar_022_f
I am? Pray tell, {PlayerName}, what am I up to?

TAG: Jafar_023_f
I don't know yet, but I've got my eye on you.

TAG: Jafar_024_f
Goodness. How simply terrifying.
