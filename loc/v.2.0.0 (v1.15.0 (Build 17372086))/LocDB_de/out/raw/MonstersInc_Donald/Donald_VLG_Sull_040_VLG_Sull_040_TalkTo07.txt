Oh brother, it's {PlayerName}. Our Villager of the Month.

Hi, Donald. Sulley wants to invite you to take part in a scavenger hunt he's organizing.

TAG: Donald_003_f
Trying to get back on my good side, huh? Hmm... Who're the other contestants?

TAG: Donald_004_f
Well, it'll be Vanellope, Stitch, Olaf and... you.

TAG: Donald_005_f
What?! Does Sulley think I'm a kid?

TAG: Donald_006_f
Does this mean you won't participate?

TAG: Donald_007_f
No, I won't! It... uh... it wouldn't be fair to the others.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's what I thought.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you afraid that Vanellope might beat you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Your loss. It sounds like fun.

TAG: Donald_008_f

TAG: Donald_009_f
WAK?!

TAG: Donald_011_f
Don't be ridiculous.

TAG: Donald_012_f
I just don't want her to get sad when *I* win.

TAG: Donald_010_f
Then you can have my spot.
