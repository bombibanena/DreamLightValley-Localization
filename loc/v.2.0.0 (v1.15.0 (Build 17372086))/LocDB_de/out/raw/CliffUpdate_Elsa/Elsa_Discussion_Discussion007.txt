{PlayerName}. I've been thinking about Olaf.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What about him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's a sweetheart.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's annoying.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
About what he represents.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
He was the first living being I made out of snow. I've started being more careful about making life.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's smart.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
No! Make an army of tiny snowmen!

TAG: Elsa_003_f
I hope so. I just feel responsible for anything I create.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
I kind of already did. I had a cold. And I accidentally made snowmen when I sneezed.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
There are a lot of them. And I feel responsible for all of them. Probably no more living snowmen for a while.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
I'm also very fond of him.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
He can be a little exasperating at times.
