You spend a lot of time talking to people, don't you? I still find that difficult sometimes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's easy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Just say what you feel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Just start.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
That's what Anna says. What makes it easy for you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Trust.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Indifference.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
Hmm. That makes sense. I usually trust the person I'm talking to, so I shouldn't worry that they'll be upset if I say the wrong thing.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. That helps.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
I guess it is easier to talk if you don't care about the people you're talking to.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
Fortunately, I am seldom in that position.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
Well, I am getting better at understanding what I feel. I suppose that's a good step.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
It is.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
If they don't like what you say, that's their problem.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. That helps.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
I don't think that's a very responsible approach.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Well, that's what Anna and Olaf do. They just start talking. It's almost like they jump off a cliff into words.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
It's kind of impressive and... really brave.
