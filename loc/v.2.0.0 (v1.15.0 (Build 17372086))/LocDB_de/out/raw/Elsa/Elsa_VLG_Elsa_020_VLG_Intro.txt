{PlayerName}, I could use some advice. Do you have a moment to talk?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Of course. What do you need?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Not right now, sorry.

TAG: Elsa_028_f
Well... have you ever...

TAG: Elsa_001_f
I guess I'm just wondering if...

TAG: Elsa_017_f
Hmm... This is hard.

TAG: Elsa_018_f
I'll start over...

TAG: Elsa_029_f
Since I've arrived here, I've tried to find my place, to fit in with everyone.

TAG: Elsa_030_f
But I feel a little lost. Have you ever felt like that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_012_f
I understand. I feel the same way.

TAG: Player_000_choice_013_f
Have you always felt like that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_014_f
I've never had that problem...

TAG: Elsa_013_f
I'm surprised. You seem so at ease. Running everywhere, helping everyone.

TAG: Elsa_037_f
This is rather strange, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Elsa_038_f
When I started reading through these recipe books, they brought back a memory of my past here in the Valley.

TAG: Elsa_027_f
I was cooking with my friends...

TAG: Elsa_039_f
And it felt like something we'd done before. I just couldn't remember it.

TAG: Elsa_040_f
We were making <ActivityItem>Arendellian Fish Pie</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Arendellian Pickled Herring</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_041_f
It was so nice. Maybe we could make one of the dishes together again.

TAG: Player_003_f
Let's make both!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
It'll be fun.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
I'm super curious about your cuisine.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
You'll feel at home twice as fast.

TAG: Elsa_016_f
But it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who feels this way.

TAG: Elsa_020_f
Hey, I just thought of something that Remy told me the other day. He was talking about how our senses of smell and taste are the most connected to our memories...

TAG: Elsa_026_f
If you want to feel more at home... why don't we try cooking something that reminds you of where you come from?

TAG: Elsa_033_f
Cooking...? How interesting. But I haven't done much cooking before...

TAG: Elsa_034_f
Well, that's another thing Remy says.

TAG: Elsa_035_f
"Anyone can cook."

TAG: Elsa_032_f
You know, it's funny â I did see a couple of traditional Arendellian <ActivityItem>Recipe Books</ActivityItem> in the Ice Cavern.

TAG: Elsa_036_f
I'll go get them...

TAG: Elsa_021_f
Oh, thank you! I really appreciate it.

TAG: Elsa_000_f
According to the <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem>, what makes the <ActivityItem>Arendellian Fish Pie</ActivityItem> so special is that you use <ActivityItem>Dandelion Syrup</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Herring</ActivityItem>, plus some <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Butter</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_024_f
The <ActivityItem>Dandelion Syrup</ActivityItem> is made from <ActivityItem>Garlic</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Lemons</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Dandelions</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Onions</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_019_f
If you bring me these Ingredients, maybe we can prepare the syrup together. The instructions are all right here.

TAG: Elsa_025_f
Oh, and the <ActivityItem>Arendellian Pickled Herring</ActivityItem> is fairly easy. Here's the <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Elsa_022_f
Oh, thank you. I hope you'll like it.

TAG: Elsa_023_f
That sounds wonderful. Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
Well, I used to when I was hiding my powers and so isolated. But these last few years, thanks to Anna's help, I've felt a lot more at peace.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
You're very lucky.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
Oh, I understand. I'd love to catch up, when you have some time.
