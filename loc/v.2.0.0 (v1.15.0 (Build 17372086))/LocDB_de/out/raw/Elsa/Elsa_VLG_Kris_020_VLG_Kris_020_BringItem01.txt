Perfect! You found everything we need.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
Can we cast the spell now?

TAG: Elsa_002_f
Yes. Here we go...

TAG: Elsa_003_f
It... it didn't work.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's not your fault.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe the magic isn't strong enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
This whole idea was crazy anyway.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
I know. We did everything correctly.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
My memories with Kristoff must not be strong enough for the enchantment.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
I didn't want to involve her because I didn't want to get her hopes up, but we'll need a lock of her hair.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
But Anna has such pretty hair!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
One Anna haircut, coming right up!

TAG: Elsa_011_f
You're right, she does. But we just need a small piece, and it will grow back. I promise you, she'll be happy to do it.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
Fine. I'll go ask Anna...

TAG: Elsa_013_f
Whoa! We just need a small piece. You don't have to give her a full haircut.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
Right. Okay. I'll go talk to Anna.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
No. It's not that. We did everything correctly.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
No, it's not. It's going to work. It's just...
