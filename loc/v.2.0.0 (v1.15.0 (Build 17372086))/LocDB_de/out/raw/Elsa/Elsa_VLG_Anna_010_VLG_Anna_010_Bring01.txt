Hello, {PlayerName}. I'm glad to see you again. Is my sister enjoying her visit to your Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She's happy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She's a great friend.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She misses you. A lot.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Oh, I'm so glad.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
But once that's all sorted out, I'll let you know that I'm ready to come to the Village.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
I'll tell Anna. Thanks, Elsa!

TAG: Elsa_011_f
There is one thing that would make her happier, though.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
Oh?

TAG: Elsa_005_f
You. I have this letter for you.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
A letter? I recognize this seal! It's from Anna.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
Hmm... She says your Valley is amazing... Oh, and this photograph? What a strange Ice Cavern. She wants me to come and see it in person.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
I do miss her... so much. And things here have been back in balance for a while now. Maybe I could visit your Village...

TAG: Elsa_004_f
There are just a few things I need to take care of first.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
That she is. No one will stand by your side like Anna. Even if she has to fight her way through a blizzard to do it.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
There is one friend she's missing an awful lot though.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
I miss her too.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
She thought you might. That's why she wanted me to give you this...
