I remember it all now... I wanted to keep something safe. Something the Forgetting was threatening.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Anna helped me hide the <ActivityItem>Crests</ActivityItem>, but then I realized anyone could stumble upon them. So I went to Merlin...

TAG: Elsa_003_f
He made sure they would only reappear if someone wielding Dreamlight Magic was near.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
Well, now that we've put the <ActivityItem>Crests</ActivityItem> back in their rightful places, we need to put the right items on these glowing pedestals.

The Forgetting was so disturbing that I wanted to be sure what I held dear was safe.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I would have done the same.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I have no idea how I would have reacted.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
My solution would have been WAY SIMPLER.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
That's good to hear.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
Now, Merlin created magic links to both Dreamlight Valley and Arendelle.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
I helped him pick the items to use.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
A plate of <ActivityItem>Arendellian Pickled Herring</ActivityItem> for the food I brought to the Village. A <ActivityItem>Passion White Lily</ActivityItem> to represent ice and snow.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
A <ActivityItem>Carrot</ActivityItem>, since they're rather special to some of my dear friends, and a <ActivityItem>Gold Ingot</ActivityItem> for the bond Anna and I have to our royal heritage...

TAG: Elsa_016_f
If we place one of each on the pedestals, we'll find what I hid.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
Thank you for being so honest, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
I'm sure. But I think Merlin liked the idea of creating a puzzle. He said it would be educational.
