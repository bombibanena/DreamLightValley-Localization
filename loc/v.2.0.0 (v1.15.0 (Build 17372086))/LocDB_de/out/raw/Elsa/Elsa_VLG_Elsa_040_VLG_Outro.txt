I remember now... There is one snowflake sewn into the lining...

It was the <Lore>first snowflake ever to fall on the Valley</Lore>...

TAG: Elsa_002_f
...because I brought snow here!

But it was your idea. You wanted me to feel at home here.

Well, we've certainly come far together, {PlayerName}.

I remember everything now: adventures, stories, the friendships I shared with everyone.

Before I came here, the Frosted Heights were just rocky cliffs. I used my magic to transform them... and I was so happy that I could contribute to this wonderful place.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
Thank you. You've been a marvelous friend.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
Which is why I want you to keep this. As a token of my appreciation.

It was the Old Ruler's idea. They wanted me to feel at home here.
