What do you mean?

You've made so many beautiful dresses!

I love the shimmery blue dress you made.

I like the white dress with the diamond pattern.

The dresses you wear around Arendelle are so pretty.

Ha! I enjoyed that one. It was important to me to wear something new.

Though thinking back on what I did back then is embarrassing.

When I was young, I used it to control myself. My gloves.

I'm glad you got rid of those.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You wore those to keep Anna safe.

Now you're older.

I am too. They felt necessary at the time, but they were painful to wear. It's good to feel the breeze on my fingertips.

I did. I felt so guilty for so long. But I was a child. It's silly to blame a child for an accident.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
I am. And I know how to trust myself.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
Thank you. I was very proud of that one.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Oh, I don't make those. Those are normal dresses. Other people sew them. I do commission them, though.
