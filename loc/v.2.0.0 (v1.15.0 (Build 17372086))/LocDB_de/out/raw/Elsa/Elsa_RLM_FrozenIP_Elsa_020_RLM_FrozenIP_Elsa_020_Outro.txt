It's... beautiful.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
And so familiar...

TAG: Player_000_f
You've been here before.

You'll remember. Give it time.

The Forgetting stole your memories.

Trust me.

You're right. It's already coming back to me. It's just a bit... cloudy. Like a dream.

The Forest of Valor was swallowed up by Giant Night Thorns. Anna and I left here to return to Arendelle.

But soon we'll all be back together. I can tell it's going to be different this time.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
Thank you for bringing me back, {PlayerName}. I can't wait to see Anna again... and all the other friends I've missed.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
Wait... I remember that... it's just a bit cloudy, like a dream.

It's a lot to take in. But it's starting to come back to me...
