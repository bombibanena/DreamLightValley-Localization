{PlayerName}, I've remembered something else about the mystery in the Ice Cavern. Do you have time to help me finish solving this puzzle?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Finally! I want answers now!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I need to prepare first.

TAG: Elsa_000_f
I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who's been getting impatient.

TAG: Elsa_017_f
Thanks to your help and support, more and more of my memories have been coming back.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
And I've remembered something about the <ActivityItem>Crests</ActivityItem> we found together â I'm the one who hid them.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Wow! That's a plot twist.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Why did you do that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Oh, NOW you remember?

TAG: Elsa_001_f
I was surprised too. I know there's more I should remember, but I just keep seeing an image in my mind of the statues of Anna and me in the Ice Cavern.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Let's go there.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What does it all mean?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
What are we going to do about it?

TAG: Elsa_012_f
Yes, that's what I was about to suggest.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
I'm guessing that's where our next clue may be. We should go there as soon as we can.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
Come with me. I want to take a closer look at them.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
I don't know. Every time I try to remember more, I just keep seeing an image in my mind of the statues of Anna and me in the Ice Cavern.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Believe me, I'm as frustrated as you are that my memories didn't come back sooner.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
Especially because every time I try to remember more, I just keep seeing an image in my mind of the statues of Anna and me in the Ice Cavern.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Of course. The cavern does seem to be getting colder.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
That doesn't bother me, but I know you need to stay warm.
