I've learned a lot about my powers in the last year. And about the Spirits of Nature. Would you like me to tell you about any of them?

The Water Spirit is also called the Water Nokk. It takes the form of a horse and has the power of the ocean.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
The Nokk guards the Enchanted Forest fiercely and won't respect you unless you prove yourself worthy.

The Fire Spirit appears as a tiny salamander who leaves a trail of fire as it runs. We call it Bruni.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Its flames can be frightening, but it only makes them in times of unrest or strife. Bruni likes it when I make snowflakes that it can eat.

The Earth Giants can be dangerous if you disturb them.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
They sleep most of the time, so you might mistake them for hills or mountains.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
But if they wake, they stomp and throw boulders. So... it's best not to wake them.

The Wind Spirit can be a playful, gentle breeze, or a swirling vortex. Olaf named it Gale.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
My mother knew Gale when she was a young girl. Gale helped her save my father.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
And Gale guided us at many points during our journey through the Enchanted Forest.
