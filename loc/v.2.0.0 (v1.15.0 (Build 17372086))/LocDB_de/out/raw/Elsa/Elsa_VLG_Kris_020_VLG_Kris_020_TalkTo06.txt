Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
I knew Anna would be happy to give us this.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Here we go...

TAG: Elsa_010_f
We did it! We have a <ActivityItem>Magic Ice Block</ActivityItem> with a memory inside!

TAG: Elsa_011_f
What do I do with it...?

TAG: Elsa_012_f
Put it down somewhere and try hitting it with your Pickaxe to find out which memory is inside.

Then show the memory to Kristoff. If the spell worked, it should bring back his memory.
