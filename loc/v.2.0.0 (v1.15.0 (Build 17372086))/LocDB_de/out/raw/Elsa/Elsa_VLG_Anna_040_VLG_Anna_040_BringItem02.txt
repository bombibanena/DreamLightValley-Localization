What's this?

TAG: Elsa_004_f
It's a gift for you from Anna and me.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
A birthday cake? But it's not my birthday.

TAG: Player_000_f
Yeah, but Anna wanted to give it to you anyway, because...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...she loves you 365 days a year.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...it's never a bad time for cake.

TAG: Elsa_006_f
That sounds just like Anna. I'm very lucky to have her as a sister.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
She had one more gift she wanted you to have.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Oh! What's this? A <ActivityItem>Book of Portraits</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Elsa_010_f
It's... us. It's drawings of our whole family from when we were little.

TAG: Elsa_011_f
Anna and I would build snowmen and then Alf, the court painter, would sketch us beside them with our parents.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
This is wonderful. Thank you for reminding me of my family and one of my favorite times.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
And I'll make sure I thank Anna, too. She always finds a way to make me feel better.

How true. And if I know Anna, it's chocolate cake!
