Hey {PlayerName}, I've been thinking... How'd you like to get around the Valley with your own <Lore>Dreamlight Magic Carpet</Lore>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
My own flying carpet? Let's make it happen!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe later!

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Ha-ha! I thought you might say that!

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
After chasing all those enchanted coins from Mr. McDuck's vault around the Valley, I bet you could really use a carpet to get around quick.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It would be nice to glide around in style!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm kind of afraid of heights...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Well, most days I'm way over my step count, so sure!

TAG: Aladdin_013_f
That's what I was thinking!

TAG: Aladdin_015_f
Trust me: Some kind of <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Carpet</ActivityItem> will change your life.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
I mean, it won't be exactly like my friend Carpet, but I think you could have a lot of fun getting around the Valley on it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'm in â what do we need?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That's so thoughtful of you!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Not sure I'm good at carpet weaving...

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Well, I guess there's really only one place to start: We gotta figure out how to make a carpet fly.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
Would you <Lore>talk to Merlin</Lore> and ask him if he knows anything about enchanting carpets?

TAG: Aladdin_016_f
While you do that, I'm gonna ask around about carpet weaving.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Hey, you deserve it!

TAG: Aladdin_017_f
First things first...

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
That's okay. We won't be doing this alone.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Oh, okay. Well, we'll make this one low-flying.

TAG: Aladdin_014_f
"Step count"? You'll have to explain that later. But glad you're interested!

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Sure, no problem. Come talk to me when you've got some time.
