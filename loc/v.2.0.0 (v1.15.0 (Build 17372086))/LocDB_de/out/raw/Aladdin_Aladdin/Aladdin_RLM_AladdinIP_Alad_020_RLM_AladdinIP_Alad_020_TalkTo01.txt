Aladdin! I spotted the <Lore>gemstones from the Protection Amulet</Lore>! The monkeys up on the rooftops have them!

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Did... did Agrabah have troops of monkeys roaming the streets before?

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
No way! They must've moved in and claimed that area of the marketplace after everyone had to flee the sandstorms.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The monkeys are pretty cute!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What would Abu say about the monkeys?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
There are a lot of monkeys â wouldn't want to make them angry.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
They are, aren't they? But if they're anything like Abu, they'd HATE being called cute.

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
If Abu had the gemstones, how would you get him to hand them over?

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Oh, he'd never just hand them over. I'd have to trade for them.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Well, they seem to like the shiny gemstones. Maybe we should find something else shiny.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Yeah. Maybe if we keep <Lore>cleaning up the marketplace, we'll find something they like better than the gemstones</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Oh, he'd probably be mad that they're taking food he wants to steal.

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
No, I think we're gonna have to be clever here.
