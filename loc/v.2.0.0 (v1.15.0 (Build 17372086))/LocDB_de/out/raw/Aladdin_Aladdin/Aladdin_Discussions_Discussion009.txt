Well, it's definitely different from what I'm used to, but I pick things up pretty quickly.

There's lots of rules, and etiquette. Luckily, Jasmine knows all that stuff.

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
AND she's a patient teacher.

Sounds like you make a good team.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Etiquette? Sounds boring.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I thought Jasmine didn't like rules?

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
We do! She teaches me, and I teach her stuff, too.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Some days, I still can't believe we found each other.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Actually, it's not! I know, I was surprised too. But it is really complex.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
I try to see things like that as a challenge or puzzle. That makes it fun!

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Just the rules that don't make sense. Jasmine is VERY smart about traditions, rituals, history...

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Pretty much everything, actually.
