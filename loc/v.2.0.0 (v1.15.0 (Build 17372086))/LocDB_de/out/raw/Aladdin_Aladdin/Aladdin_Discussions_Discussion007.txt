Wow, that's, uh... quite a question.

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
Well, there's a lot more to it than I imagined. The clothes, the attention, the responsibility...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Tell me more about the clothes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Did you enjoy the attention?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Were the responsibilities steep?

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Okay, I can't lie â THAT I really liked.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
You'd think prince clothing would be itchy and stuffy...

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
But no! It was cool and really comfortable.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Maybe not as comfortable as my usual clothes, but pretty luxurious.

TAG: Aladdin_012_f
How 'bout you? Would you wanna be royalty?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
In a heartbeat!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Seems like too much work.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I already am royalty! Dreamlight royalty!

TAG: Aladdin_013_f
Well, I hope you have a great time with it!

TAG: Aladdin_014_f
Yeah. You should see the list of duties Jasmine has. I try to pitch in where I can, but it's exhausting just to watch!

TAG: Aladdin_015_f
Oh, sorry! My apologies, your highness! Heh. Guess I'm still learning the etiquette.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Gotta admit, I really liked it at first.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
But after a while, the pressure starts to get to you.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
You can't just go for a relaxing walk down the street without everybody looking at you.

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
For me, not really.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
But then again, I wasn't really a prince â no kingdom to run. I just had to stay on top of my story. Which... turns out, did NOT work so well.
