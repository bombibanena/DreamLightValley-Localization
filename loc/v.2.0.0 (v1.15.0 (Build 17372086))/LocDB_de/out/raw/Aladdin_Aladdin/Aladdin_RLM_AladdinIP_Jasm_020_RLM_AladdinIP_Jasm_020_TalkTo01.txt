Hey! How'd the talk with Jasmine go?

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
She's hard at work translating the <ActivityItem>Ancient Tome</ActivityItem>, but she thought you could help me gather some stuff we'll need.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Sure! What's on the list?

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Well, we have to get an <ActivityItem>Alchemy Table</ActivityItem> set up for further crafting.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
And the table in the Artisans' District has definitely seen better days. Guess we're fixing it up!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Exactly!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
... Are you secretly an alchemist?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
How do you know about Alchemy Tables?

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Wow, this brings me back...

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
I remember when the <Lore>Artisans' District</Lore> was really thriving. Every morning, there'd be plumes of colorful smoke and the strangest smells...

TAG: Aladdin_014_f
If we're gonna repair the table, we'll need to <Lore>find a Cauldron, a Crucible, and a base for an Alchemy Table</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
And you'd better <Lore>keep that Protection Amulet on, in case some of the stuff's in the sandstorms</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
Given how strong those winds are, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the pieces <Lore>ended up outside the walls of Agrabah</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_015_f
Guess we'd better get to work! I may have some questions for you later, so let's meet back in the <Lore>Artisans' District</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Nah. I just kinda like the place.

When you grow up on the street, you learn to keep your eyes open.
