{PlayerName}, did you hear what Jasmine said?! She said the flowers reminded her of the palace.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Seemed to me that she LIKED them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Doesn't that mean they were really impressive?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hm, yeah, she's probably been given lots of flowers before...

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
But I was hoping I could give her something she LOVES. *sigh*

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Wait... I do have this scroll that points to something that MIGHT impress her...

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Mr. McDuck gave it to me after we defeated his security system. We were talking about his old treasure-hunting days...

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
He gave the scroll to me, and told me to have a new adventure.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A treasure hunt? Sounds fun!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What does it say?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You ALREADY impress Jasmine.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
You'll join me? Great! I bet this'll get me the impressive gift I'm looking for.

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
The scroll says, "To begin at the mermaid's isle."

TAG: Aladdin_015_f
Huh... Okay, maybe it means a place where a <Lore>mermaid was stranded in the Valley</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
You're probably right. I know that she loves me for who I am. But that doesn't mean I can't try and find something special for her.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Good point! Let's treasure hunt.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm not sure... but I'll help you.

TAG: Aladdin_013_f
Yes!

TAG: Aladdin_014_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. You're a good friend.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
To anyone else? Yeah. To a princess raised in a palace? I don't know...

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
You're right... I need to try harder. Jasmine deserves something really special.
