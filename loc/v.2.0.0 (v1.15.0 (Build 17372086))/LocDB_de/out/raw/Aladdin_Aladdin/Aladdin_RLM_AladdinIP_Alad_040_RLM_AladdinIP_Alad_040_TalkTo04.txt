Wow, Agrabah looks almost as good as new.

Well, the Valley will be waiting for him when he's ready, but let's get you and Carpet back for now.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Great! I know Carpet will be excited to spend some time with you after you helped save Agrabah.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Yeah! You really helped with all the sandstone deposits.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
I buried what's left of the Windcaller crystals out in the desert, so hopefully nobody will stumble onto it again.

And the Sultan will deal with the fractured stone around the Central Market.

So you're ready to come and visit Dreamlight Valley?

TAG: Aladdin_014_f
Yes! Carpet and I are ready to head there now. Abu's gonna stay in Agrabah for a while and keep the Sultan company, but he might join us later.

TAG: Aladdin_015_f
Abu is friends with the Sultan? That's a surprise!

TAG: Aladdin_016_f
Are you kidding? They're best pals now! The Sultan loves hiding treasures for Abu to find, and Abu loves pretending that he gives them back.

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
Don't worry â once a month, I clear out his favorite hiding spots and return everything.
