Well, I didn't really go anywhere growing up, and I don't like to be gone from my friends for too long...

But sometimes a romantic carpet ride to a far-away land is just what you need.

Hmm... Oh, there's this garden on the water with an amazing building surrounded by giant columns and beautiful trees.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
The apples aren't bad either.

Where would you visit next?

Does Carpet ever get tired?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'd love to travel more.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Honestly, I'm happy here for now!

I've got Jasmine with me, good friends, and so much still to explore. Why leave?

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
Yeah, sure. But I let him take the lead.

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
Whenever he needs to rest, we always take a break.

TAG: Aladdin_012_f
You definitely should!

TAG: Aladdin_013_f
You learn so much about the world â and yourself.

Oh, there was this one place that seemed to be having some sort of festival. They were shooting sparkling lights up into the sky! It was incredible!

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
I don't know how they did it, but it made my time there with Jasmine pretty romantic.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Well, there's this desert city, but it's on a river! And there are these huge stone pyramids.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Though Jasmine and I do feel a little bad about distracting this sculptor and ruining his big statue.
