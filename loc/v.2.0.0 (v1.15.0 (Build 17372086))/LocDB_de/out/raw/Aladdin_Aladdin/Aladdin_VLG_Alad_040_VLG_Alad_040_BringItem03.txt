Everything's looking good! And hey â while I was working, I had another idea.

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
It'd be nice to have a bit of Agrabah here in the Valley. What if we made our own marketplace?

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
We could get other Villagers who have stalls involved. Or at least ask them for advice.

A little market area sounds amazing!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Let's get started right away!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
But I don't know anything about running a market!

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
Glad you think so!

TAG: Aladdin_013_f
Could ya go <Lore>talk to some stall owners</Lore> and see if they're interested in joining our market?

TAG: Aladdin_014_f
The Gem Stall just needs a few finishing touches.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
I knew you'd be on board!

Don't worry; this isn't just on you. It's about everyone coming together as a community.
