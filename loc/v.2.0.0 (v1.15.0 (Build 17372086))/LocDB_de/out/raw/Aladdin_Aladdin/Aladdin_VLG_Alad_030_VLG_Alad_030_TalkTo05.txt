All right! We fixed the pillar!

... And nothing's happening.

Maybe a piece is missing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe these symbols are instructions.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I have no idea what to do here!

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Could be. Is there <Lore>someone in the Valley who knows about the island</Lore> who could help us figure out if there's a missing piece?

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
I'll <Lore>take a photo</Lore> and <Lore>go ask around the Village</Lore> about the island, the symbols, and art history.

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
Great! I might stay here and keep watch over this thing or search the Village for more clues.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Maybe it just needs to be a certain time of day and a shadow will point to the treasure. Or it might need gems to power it up...

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Could be. But I've never seen symbols like this before. Is there someone in the Village who has?

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Me neither... But maybe someone in the Village does. What do you think?
