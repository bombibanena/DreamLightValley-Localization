Whoa. That's different. And a little intense.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We can figure this out together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What did we get ourselves into?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Mr. McDuck's security isn't ready for us.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Yeah. Sure. You're right.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Let's look around and see what we're dealing with. What jumps out at you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Lights.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Buttons.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'll figure it out as we go!

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
You're right. There are new <Lore>lights shining in big pools</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Something tells me we <Lore>need to stay out of those</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Right. Buttons like the one on the wall beside the counter.

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
That button started the system. Wonder <Lore>what these ones will start... or stop</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
Okay, let's jump in!

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
We have to <Lore>make it to the vault without getting caught</Lore>.

TAG: Aladdin_012_f
Just need to be careful, go slow, and take our time.

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
Why don't ya try <Lore>pushing that button on the table over there</Lore> to see what it does? I'll keep watch. I don't want any surprises.

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Don't panic, {PlayerName}. We just need to stay alert, and we'll get through this.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
That's right. I know we can figure this out.
