Heh. I guess I was. It's just... there's so much food in this Valley!

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
You can just pick apples. Or catch fish. Anytime you want.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
There's enough for everyone.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You need to go to Remy's or Tiana's for really good food.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You sound confused?

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Yeah. There is. It's kinda different from how I grew up.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Whatever you're doing here, it's great!

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Oh, I believe it.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
I'm pretty happy with most food, and it smells great.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
It's just so different from how I grew up.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Seems sort of... magical.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
I guess that's a big part of this place, huh?
