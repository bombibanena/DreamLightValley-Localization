So, uh, how do you feel about tigers?

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
I'm told they are cousins of a sort. Belle showed me an image of one once. They certainly lack majesty.

Hmm, Rajah seems pretty majestic to me. He lives in a palace.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Oh you can put a tiger in as many palaces as you like...

That won't give them the mane that defines lions as the rulers of all they see.

Wait â are you saying to be worthy as a leader I need to change MY hair?
