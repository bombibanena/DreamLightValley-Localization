It was definitely tricky up there, but now Agrabah can start getting back to normal.

Mission accomplished!

I couldn't have done it without you and Jasmine.

No way am I letting weird ancient magical wind structures mess with my friends!

Not every visitor would have stuck around and helped like that. You're a real friend.

So, what's next? Are you ready to visit Dreamlight Valley with me now?

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
I better make sure everything's settled down here first.

But why don't you <Lore>talk to Jasmine</Lore>? She definitely deserves a break. She's been so worried since this whole mess started.

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
True! The fountain is done and the people of Agrabah are safe. She does deserve to relax.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
And we couldn't have done it without you!

Well, we â and Carpet â are happy to be considered your friends.
