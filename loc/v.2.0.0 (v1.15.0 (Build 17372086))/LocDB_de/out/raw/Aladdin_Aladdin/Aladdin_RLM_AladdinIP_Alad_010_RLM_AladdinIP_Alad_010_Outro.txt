Aladdin, I managed to repair all the stalls!

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Great! While you were doing that, I found this old-looking piece of jewelry! It's got some strange writing on it that I can't read.

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
Hmm... What if we take it to Jasmine?

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Great idea! She's studied all sorts of stuff â art, history, science, and ancient languages.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
If anyone can figure it out, it's her. But we gotta hurry. We can't forget that Carpet's in trouble too, stuck in the Windcaller's vortex.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sure we'll be able to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can't imagine being stuck in a magical construct like that...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Yeah, Jasmine really knows her stuff.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Now that you're here with us, I've got a lot less doubt.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Well, let's go bring the <ActivityItem>Amulet</ActivityItem> to Jasmine and keep our fingers crossed.

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
Yeah. And it's not the first time. He was stuck in the Cave of Wonders for I don't know how long.

TAG: Aladdin_012_f
She's so smart! I learn something new from her every day.
