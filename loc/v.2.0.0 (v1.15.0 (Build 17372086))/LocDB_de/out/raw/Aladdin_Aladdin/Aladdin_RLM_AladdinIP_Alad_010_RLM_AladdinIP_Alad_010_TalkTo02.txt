Whoa, this looks even worse up close!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yeah, it... does not look great.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I wonder what useful stuff we can find there.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I bet it will look incredible once we fix it up.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
I can't believe it... Wish you could've seen it before.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
It's got all kinds of rare goods brought in by traders from just about everywhere.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
If we're lucky, maybe we can find something that'll help us stop the Windcaller.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
And hey, while we're doing that, let's also look for stuff to repair the stalls.

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Fine Rope</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Timber Stacks</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Bolts of Silk</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Okay! I'll find all of that and make us some <ActivityItem>Stall Repair Kits</ActivityItem>. We'll have everything we need to fix up the stalls in one convenient package.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Sounds great. Oh, and you should take this. It'll help clear away the smell from all the rotting fruit.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
Hopefully, lots.

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
Yeah! It will! The <Lore>South Market</Lore> was incredible before the Windcaller messed everything up.
