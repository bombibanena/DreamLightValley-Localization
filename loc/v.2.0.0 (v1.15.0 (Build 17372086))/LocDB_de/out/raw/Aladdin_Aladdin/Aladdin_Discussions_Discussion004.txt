If you had three wishes... No, that's too complicated.

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
If you had ONE wish, anything in the world, what would you wish for?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Money.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Love.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Something else...

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
I get that. I used to think being rich, living someplace fabulous, would mean you'd never have any problems.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
But I learned that's not true.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Don't get me wrong. Having enough to take care of yourself and those you love is super important.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
It's just NOT ALL that's important.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Sorry, but that's against Genie's wish provisos. What else?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Knowledge.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Power.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
A thousand monkeys!

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
I never thought about that. What a great use of a wish.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
I bet that's the sort of thing Merlin would wish for.

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
Huh. I knew a grand vizier who'd agree with you.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
Not sure that's the best choice.

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
Really? Are you sure?

TAG: Aladdin_012_f
I know one monkey pretty well, and Abu's a handful all by himself.
