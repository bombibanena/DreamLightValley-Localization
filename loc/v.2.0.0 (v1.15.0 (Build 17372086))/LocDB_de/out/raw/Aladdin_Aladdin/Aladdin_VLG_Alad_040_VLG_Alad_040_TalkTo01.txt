I think WALLÂ·E really loved our gift for his collection.

TAG: Player_000_f
I think so too.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He was so excited!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd be pretty happy if someone brought ME gems.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Gems are shiny. Shiny good.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Yeah! Gems are pretty valuable. There's a lot to be excited about.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
More than you think. Lots of Villagers use gems for plenty of things. Magic, arts and crafts, decorating...

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
Really? Do ya think the Village would like it if they could get their hands on gems more easily?

TAG: Player_001_f
You mean like a gem stall?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Everyone would love it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I NEED IT.

TAG: Aladdin_013_f
Well, then I say we make it happen.

TAG: Aladdin_016_f
I love the stalls in the Agrabah marketplace.

TAG: Aladdin_018_f
The vendors from far-off lands, the fruits, the breads...

TAG: Aladdin_019_f
Ya know, I'd like to bring some of that here. {PlayerName}, could you <Lore>head back to the marketplace in Agrabah and get building supplies for our stall</Lore>?

TAG: Aladdin_000_f
I'm gonna start collecting gems and some other supplies we'll need.

TAG: Aladdin_014_f
You sure?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I've been waiting for a gem stall forever!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Very sure!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
This is not joke time; this is SERIOUS!

TAG: Aladdin_015_f
Whoa, I can tell!

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Me too. Gems are pretty valuable.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Ha. You and Abu would definitely get along. Plus, gems are pretty valuable.
