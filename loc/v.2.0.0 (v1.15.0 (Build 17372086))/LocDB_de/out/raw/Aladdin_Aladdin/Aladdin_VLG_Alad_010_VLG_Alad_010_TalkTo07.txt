Okay... We're here.

Seems... kinda normal in here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
... Nothing looks different.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
No laser beams? No robot dogs?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll explain that joke some other time.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
I'll hold you to that. Let's keep going.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
