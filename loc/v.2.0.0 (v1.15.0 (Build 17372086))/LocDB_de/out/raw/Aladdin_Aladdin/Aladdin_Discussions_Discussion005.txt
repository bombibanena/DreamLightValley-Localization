Carpet's great. I met him in the Cave of Wonders. He saved Abu and me, big time.

We have SO much fun flying together.

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Have you ever gone flying?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I have!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Never.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I've flown in an airplane.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Then you understand. It makes the world feel completely different.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Like you're free. Like you can go anywhere â do anything!

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Oh, you gotta try it! It's like nothing else.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
I could ask Carpet if he'll take you for a ride sometime. Would you like that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do I have to sing?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm scared of heights...

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Great! I'll ask Carpet next time I see him.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
What? No, definitely not.

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
Oh, well then, maybe not. Unless! You could ask Carpet to fly really low to the ground. It'll be like you're floating.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
I don't know what that is. But if it lets you fly, that's great!
