My favorite? Whoa, it's so hard to choose...

Well, I'm definitely happy to be back here with all our friends.

The Forgetting took those memories away, but I think I knew something was missing. And if I haven't told you â you've done a great job fixing things up around here.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why, thank you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I wouldn't trust anyone else with decorating!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
SOMEBODY had to do it.

Hey, credit where it's due.

I know how much work it is to be in charge. I try to help Jasmine and the Sultan out, and they're STILL busy all the time.

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
I don't just mean the decorating. I mean... You're helping all the Villagers.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
Bringing us back together, looking after us. It's kinda amazing, really.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Well, we're lucky that somebody is you.
