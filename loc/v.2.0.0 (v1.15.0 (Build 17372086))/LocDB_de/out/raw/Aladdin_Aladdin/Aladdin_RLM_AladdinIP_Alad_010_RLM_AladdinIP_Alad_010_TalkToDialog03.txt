Rats! I'd usually go through here, but there's so much wreckage in the way...

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
Hmm, do we need to backtrack and find another route?

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Depends â do you trust me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, no.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I trust that you know Agrabah...

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Then let's get clearing.

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
If the sandstones didn't stop you before, you should be able to clear the way easily enough.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Okay. Well, you're welcome to try and find another route to the <Lore>South Market</Lore>, but I don't think you'll have much luck.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
If you change your mind, I'll be here.

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
I see your point. What did you have in mind?

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
Then trust me when I say we need to clear the way here.
