Okay, here's the surprise...

One of my favorite memories with Carpet was taking Jasmine on this amazing nighttime tour. We saw things we'd never seen before... And even the things we already knew looked different. More magical, somehow.

So I set up a tour for you to take around the Valley on your new <Lore>Dreamlight Magic Carpet</Lore>!

That's the perfect way to test it out!

It's not a race, is it?

What if I get carpet-sick?

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
I'm glad you think so!

While you're out there, keep an eye out for the <Lore>banners I set up</Lore>. They'll show you where to go.

But before you do, I have some fresh-baked treats from Minnie for you. She was so excited about this, she was baking while I was weaving.

Flying's actually kind of tiring. This'll help keep your energy up.

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
No way; this is just for you. Go as slow or as fast as you want.

In my experience, flying carpets are usually pretty smooth. So hopefully, it won't be a problem.
