Well, I picked some bananas. I'm headed to Remy's. He's gonna teach me how to make something called a "banana split."

TAG: Aladdin_001_f
It's for the raccoons in the Forest of Valor.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You sure they like banana splits?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Raccoons are adorable.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How would Abu feel about raccoons?

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Well, I know they prefer berries...

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
But who knows; maybe they'll appreciate a change of pace!

TAG: Aladdin_004_f
Won't know until I try. AND, I'll have a great treat to make for Abu in the future.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
They are. And smart!

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
Did you know they have thumbs?

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
They can open things with their little hands!

TAG: Aladdin_008_f
... Can you tell that Jasmine and I've been reading about the animals here?

TAG: Aladdin_009_f
Oh, he'd be suspicious at first.

TAG: Aladdin_010_f
But he'd warm up to them eventually, especially if they share food.

TAG: Aladdin_011_f
Abu knows he'll always be my best friend. Hey, maybe I'll make HIM a banana split the next time I see him!
