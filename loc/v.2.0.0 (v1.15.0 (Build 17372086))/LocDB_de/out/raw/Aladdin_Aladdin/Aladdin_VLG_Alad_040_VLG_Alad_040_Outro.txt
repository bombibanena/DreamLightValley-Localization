{PlayerName}, we really did it. I think everyone in the Village is gonna get a lot of use outta the new stall.

Feels good to help people out, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's the best part of community!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The Gem Stall is great for me, too!

If I don't do it, no one will!

TAG: Aladdin_003_f
Yeah, and now the marketplace can keep bringing us all together.

TAG: Aladdin_005_f
We make a pretty great team. Testing Mr. McDuck's security system, weaving magic carpets, treasure hunting, and now this?

TAG: Aladdin_006_f
It's been nice spending time with you in the Valley again.

TAG: Aladdin_007_f
WALLÂ·E, Jasmine, and I are gonna go treasure hunting now. But before I leave, here's something to... well, I guess to mark our friendship.

TAG: Aladdin_002_f
Excellent! I'll be sure to keep it stocked up.

You're a good leader, {PlayerName}.
