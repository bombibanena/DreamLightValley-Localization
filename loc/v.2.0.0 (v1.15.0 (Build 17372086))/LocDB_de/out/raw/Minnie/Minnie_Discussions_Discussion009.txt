Oh, {PlayerName}, I just love how the Valley looks at night.

When I'm standing on Dazzle Beach as all the stars come out over the Beach...

TAG: Minnie_002_f
It's almost magical.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I feel the same!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I prefer the daytime.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Right at sunset, that's the best.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Somehow I thought you would. You'll have to join Mickey and me on one of our evening strolls.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Well, I do love a nice sunny day in the Meadow.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
But there's something enchanting about the Valley at night.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
I agree! Mickey and I love to picnic in the Meadow and watch the sun set over Dream Castle.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
It's the prettiest sight in the whole Valley.
