I've been thinking of writing a song about the Valley.

But I'm having trouble thinking of a good name for it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
"Dreamlight Ditty."

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
"The Valley Twist."

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
"Let It Go."

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Oh, that's adorable! Thank you!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
That would be a perfect name for a dance tune!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Hmm... Sounds familiar. Hee-hee!
