Yoo-hoo, {PlayerName}! I've been thinking about all the wonderful work you do.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
It's so kind of you, but I think you could use some help.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
So, I think it's time we put the Cheerful Chums Club back together!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's the Cheerful Chums Club?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'll be back! I'm busy!

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Oh, I thought I'd mentioned it to you. The club was a group of Villagers.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
We made sure everyone in the Village had what they needed.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
It was a lot like what you do.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Before the Forgetting, we used to hold secret meetings in the swamp.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
(We usually held those secret meetings to plan surprise parties! *giggle*)

TAG: Minnie_005_f
We even had our own banner! Hmm... I wonder if there's anything left of it...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Busy being helpful, if I were to guess. {PlayerName}, make sure to rest sometimes!
