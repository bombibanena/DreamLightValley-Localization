Excuse me, Moana? Do you know of a good place to gather seashells?

TAG: Minnie_001_f
Sure! I can show you my favorite part of the Beach.

Thank you! The shells here are so pretty. I'd love to make something with them.

I could show you how to make a shell necklace, if you'd like.

That would be wonderful! Thank you!
