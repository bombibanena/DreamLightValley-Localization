I just love bows! They're my favorite accessory. And there are so many kinds... Butterfly bows. Button bows. Ribbon bows.

I'm not a bow kind of person.

Those are such fun! My favorite big bow is made out of loops of pretty red ribbon.

Me too! My favorite small bows are a pair of little navy blue bows. I also have some gold ones I wear on my black shoes.
