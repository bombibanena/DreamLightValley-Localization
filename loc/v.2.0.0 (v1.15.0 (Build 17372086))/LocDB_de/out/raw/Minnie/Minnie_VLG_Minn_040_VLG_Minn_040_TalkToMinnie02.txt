Hello, {PlayerName}! Oh, what do you have there?

TAG: Minnie_002_f
The next thing to do is get some new members.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Anna and Woody used to be in the club. I'll see if they're here.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
And of course, you should be an official member, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
Actually, you should be the president!

TAG: Minnie_013_f
Would you mind if we had our first meeting in your House?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No problem at all!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's a bit messy...

TAG: Minnie_001_f
It's a bit of a mess... but it's a banner and it says... "Cheerful Chums"?! Oh, of course!

TAG: Minnie_007_f
That's the banner from the club I told you about!

TAG: Minnie_008_f
I asked, but I couldn't find any remaining members of the club...

TAG: Minnie_009_f
So, we'll just have to start it up again!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Now, we had a saying at the club...

TAG: Minnie_004_f
"Always make sure Dreamlight Valley is a happy and beautiful place!"

TAG: Minnie_005_f
I think Anna and Woody came up with that. We should repair the banner for them.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Let's see... We'll need to make a new red dye, and gather some <ActivityItem>Fabric</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Gold Nuggets</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
Wonderful! I'll go get the other members, and we'll meet you at your House!

TAG: Minnie_015_f
It may take me a while, so you should have time to repair the banner and hang it up to welcome everyone to the club.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
Hmm... Well, it will take me a while to gather the other members. That should give you enough time to do whatever you need to do.

TAG: Minnie_017_f
Oh, and don't forget to hang the banner to welcome everyone to the club!
