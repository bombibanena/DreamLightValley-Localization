Mickey! Mickey!

TAG: Minnie_009_f
You couldn't be more right. Oh, Mickey, I love you! And I want to make sure I remember that in my heart and in my head, always.

We have to protect our Memories from the Forgetting. Where's that Dreamlight Magnifier?

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Minnie? What's wrong? Are you okay?

TAG: Minnie_000_f
I'm wonderful! I remember everything! I remember you!

TAG: Minnie_001_f
You do? You do! Ha-ha! I knew you would!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
But Minnie... why are you crying?

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Oh, Mickey, I'm so sorry. I forgot I loved you.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Gosh, Minnie, don't be sorry. It's not your fault.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
And you didn't forget. Not really. Not in your heart.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
We never really forget memories we keep in our hearts.
