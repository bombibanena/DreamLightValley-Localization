Thank you for bringing my House back! I feel much more awake now!

TAG: Minnie_010_f
But my head is still a little bit muddled. Are you Mickey?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No, I'm {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's a really weird question, Minnie.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You don't remember Mickey?

TAG: Minnie_001_f
Oh, it's lovely to meet you, {PlayerName}. But I really must find Mickey.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
I wandered for so long, and all I remember is that I was looking for Mickey.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
It was very important that I find him.

TAG: Minnie_013_f
Don't worry. He's here. And I've gotta go talk to him!

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Minnie? Is that my name? Well, that's very good to know.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
I think I've forgotten a few things. Maybe... a lot of things.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Well, I remember the name. But not much else.
