{PlayerName}, did you know there used to be a <ActivityItem>Rustic Clock Tower</ActivityItem> in the Plaza?

TAG: Minnie_005_f
It was quite large and elegant, and it helped everyone keep time.

TAG: Minnie_001_f
It seems to have disappeared during the Forgetting.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Would you help me bring it back to Dreamlight Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course I'll help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll help later! I promise!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Wonderful! Now let me see...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
It was very tall. Built of <ActivityItem>Stones</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Oh, and the clock hands were made of Iron.

TAG: Minnie_004_f
I'll be looking forward to it. Come back when you're ready!
