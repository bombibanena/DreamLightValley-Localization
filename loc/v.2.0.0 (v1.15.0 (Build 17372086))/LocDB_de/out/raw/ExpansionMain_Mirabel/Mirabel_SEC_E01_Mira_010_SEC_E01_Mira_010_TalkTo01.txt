Antonio is going to love the pictures you took!

TAG: Mirabel_001_f
But some of those chigÃ¼iros looked a little hungry. I wonder if we should try <Lore>feeding them</Lore>?

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
What do you think their favorite food is here?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Veggies...?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Anything 5 stars?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Obviously molten chocolate lava cake.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
That makes sense... But what kind of vegetables?

TAG: Mirabel_007_f
If we can <Lore>figure out the chigÃ¼iros' favorite food</Lore> and feed them, I can include that in my letter to Antonio.

TAG: Mirabel_008_f
He'll want to know if they're like the ones back home.

TAG: Mirabel_009_f
There must be <Lore>someone who's spent a lot of time in the Wild Tangle</Lore> who knows what they like...

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
Hmm... If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably something simpler.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Heh-heh! I think you're thinking of Anna, not the chigÃ¼iros.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Ooh, no. I think that would make a chigÃ¼iro sick.
