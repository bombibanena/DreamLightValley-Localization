Hola, {PlayerName}! For my painting today, I'm thinking about... self-expression, my family, and Casita â my favorite inspirations.

What do you think? It's a self-portrait inspired by the art on the doors Casita creates.

Such a creative and personal idea!

Casita will love it!

Casita's style's pretty amazing, so I've got a lot to live up to.

You think? I can't wait to bring it home!

Well, I don't think I'm as good as Rapunzel yet. I've got a lot to learn!
