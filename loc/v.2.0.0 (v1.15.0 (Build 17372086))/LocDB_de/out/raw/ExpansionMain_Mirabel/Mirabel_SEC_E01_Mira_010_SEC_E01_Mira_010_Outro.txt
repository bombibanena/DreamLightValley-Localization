The chigÃ¼iros love <ActivityItem>Cabbage</ActivityItem>? So does Antonio! Especially MamÃ¡'s repollo guisado.

{PlayerName}, will you help me finish my letter to him?

TAG: Mirabel_002_f
I just need the perfect send-off...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
"AdiÃ³s to my favorite cousin!"

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
"Come visit soon!"

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You said he was your roommate, right? Maybe, "To the world's best roomie."

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
Actually, it's true. Just don't tell my other cousins.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
And... It's done! I'm gonna send this letter right away!

Oh, I almost forgot... While I was studying the chigÃ¼iros, I learned something from EVE about the <ActivityItem>Monkeys</ActivityItem> in Ancient's Landing.

She showed me that they're crazy for desserts! Maybe you could try feeding them some of the ones that I got from Remy?

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
I hope he does. There's so much here I would love to show him!

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Of course! Spending all that time with Antonio in the nursery was really nice.
