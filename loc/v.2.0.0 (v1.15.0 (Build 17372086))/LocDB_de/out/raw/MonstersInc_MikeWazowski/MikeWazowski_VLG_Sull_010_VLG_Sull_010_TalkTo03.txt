...

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
OH! I remember! Monster Movie Night! That's great news!

TAG: MikeWazowski_000_f
Let me guess. He needs me to make my famous snack mix? He always burns it.

TAG: Player_000_f
It's like you're reading my mind...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is there a batch waiting for me already?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you need anything to make it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Please tell me you're not reading minds.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
No. It's better fresh. I'll take care of it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Oh, I'm so excited! Monster Movie Night was the best!

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
You can tell Sulley I'll bring the snacks, no problem.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Quick question, {PlayerName}... Are you planning to go to Monster Movie Night dressed like that?

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
What's wrong with my outfit?

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Nothing per se... But it's a cozy movie night with pals. You'll wanna be relaxed and in the monster spirit.

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Oh, you know what Sulley would love? If you put on something <Lore>blue and a pair of scarer slippers</Lore>. It'll really make him feel appreciated.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
No, I have a special secret recipe! It's infallible!

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
You'll never know. Heh-heh.
