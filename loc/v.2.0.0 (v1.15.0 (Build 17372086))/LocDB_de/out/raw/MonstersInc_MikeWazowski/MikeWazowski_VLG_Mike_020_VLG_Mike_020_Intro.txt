{PlayerName}, just who I wanted to see! We need to talk about the Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure, what's up?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, I'll have to get back to you about this.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
How do I put this politely...

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
...your Valley's too nice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a problem for you?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
... Thanks?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Oh no, whatever will I do?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
There's no edge to it. No culture. No... no grit. You get it, right?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Uhh, not really.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Okay, let me explain... I went by both Remy's restaurant and Mr. McDuck's store and, well...

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
What happened at Mr. McDuck's?

TAG: Player_003_choice_003_f
What happened at Chez Remy?

TAG: Player_003_choice_004_f
I take it you have some ideas?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Nothing, except... He desperately needs some lessons in what's fashionable!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Hey, he does his best.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I like what he stocks!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
He could have some more variety.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Well, I heard he had an amazing dish, but it was all about FRESH fruit! Something about a "Celebration of Raspberries"!

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
I thought Remy was supposed to be a good chef!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Yes!

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
What?! No, no, no! We're goin' with the classiest of Ingredients.

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Rotting fish.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Excuse me?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
This is a joke, right?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Sure!

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
So what's the plan?

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Well, this place needs a little style. A little pizzazz.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
A little "je ne sais quoi" that apparently only I can provide.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
All right, what do you want to bring into the Valley?

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Cologne.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
It's so... nature-y here. I wanna smell like I'm about to spend a month's salary at Harryhausen's.

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Not like I just stepped off the farm.

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Sure, what kind of cologne do you want to make? I can get some spices like vanilla, maybe some musk...

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
Look, if you talk to Sulley, he'll say Eau de Rotting Fish is old-fashioned. But to me, it just says... classic sophistication.

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
This shouldn't be too hard to make.

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
First step: <Lore>Get a good old fish from Remy</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
Then <Lore>bury it and let the scent mature</Lore>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_029_f
Despite my better judgment... I'm on it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_030_f
Great!

TAG: MikeWazowski_023_f
... I see I have a lot to do if I wanna bring a touch of sophistication to this place.

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
Finally, someone around here with taste!
