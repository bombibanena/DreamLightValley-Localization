So? Am I the new superstar visionary of the Valley or what?

Let's not exaggerate TOO much here.

I don't want you to be lonely here!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Uhh...

Hold your applause while I get ready for my close-up!

Actually... Remy didn't like the <ActivityItem>Gourmet Rot Dog</ActivityItem>.

What?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
Sorry Mike, but I think your tastes are a little TOO experimental for most folks here.

Ah, but it gets lonely sometimes when success lifts you up this high.

I have an idea â why don't you go share that <ActivityItem>Gourmet Rot Dog</ActivityItem> with Sulley?

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
I bet you he'd love a little taste of home.

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
Great idea, {PlayerName}!

TAG: MikeWazowski_028_f
I'll go find him now.
