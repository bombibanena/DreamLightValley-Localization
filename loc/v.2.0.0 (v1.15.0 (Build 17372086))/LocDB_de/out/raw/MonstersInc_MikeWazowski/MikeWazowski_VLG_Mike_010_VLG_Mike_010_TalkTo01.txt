How's this? Mr. McDuck hooked me up with a set of goggles.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Wow... Those are heavy duty. Like something you'd find in a CDA supply closet.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You don't like them?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Yeah, it kinda freaks me out too.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
WE'VE GOT A 23-19!

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
No, they're perfect! I feel like I'm back in Monstropolis.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
What do you need?

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Well, I can get you a list, but I'm not exactly sure where to find the Ingredients.

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
Are you up for a little scavenger hunt?

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
Sure!

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
Okay, first I'll need some <ActivityItem>Desiccated Fishing Bait<ActivityItem>...

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
Then some <ActivityItem>Ancient Crumbs</ActivityItem> and finally some <ActivityItem>Suspicious Fridge Gunk</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Those are... really gross, Mike.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sure, any idea where I might be able to find everything?

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Now that I'm all goggled up, do you feel a little better?

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Definitely! But if you wanted to REALLY make me feel comfortable...

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
You could help me with my... my... ACHOO! My allergies. I swear, the flowers around here are raining pollen!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Oh, you've got pollen allergies?

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
Afraid so. One of the many reasons I like living in the city!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Can I get you some kind of allergy medicine? Maybe talk to Merlin about a potion?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Mmm, not sure anything you'd have here would do the trick. I need somethin' with a real monstrous kick, ya know what I mean?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
BUT... if you bring me some special Ingredients, I can make a <ActivityItem>Monstrous De-Pollinator Solution</ActivityItem> that'll knock your socks off!

TAG: MikeWazowski_033_f
Gross? Are you kidding me?! These are top-tier Ingredients we're talking about here!

TAG: MikeWazowski_034_f
My formula will not work with sub-par supplies.

TAG: MikeWazowski_036_f
Okay, sorry I asked! Where can I find your unique shopping list?

TAG: MikeWazowski_035_f
I don't know. Maybe try the <Lore>Houses of different Villagers</Lore>?

TAG: MikeWazowski_037_f
Cool, I'll start there.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
There's somethin' about the way they magnify your eyes...

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
WHERE?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Actually, you're kinda the 23-19 here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
But don't worry; we don't have an incinerator.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Well, that's a relief.
