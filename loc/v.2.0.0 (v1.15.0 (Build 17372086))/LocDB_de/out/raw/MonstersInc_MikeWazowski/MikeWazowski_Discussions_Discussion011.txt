I've got some more jokes for ya! Hot off the press!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's hear them!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hmm, maybe later...

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
What's a drummer's favorite vegetable?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I don't know â what?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Actually, that's enough joking around for now.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Beets! Good, right?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
For my next one... Why can't you trust Scar?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Because he's a villain?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Why?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
That's enough comedy for now.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Well yeah... But also â he's always lion!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Last one: How many tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
How many?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
... I hope you didn't tickle Ursula.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
That's enough joking around for now.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Ten-tickles! Get it? Because octopuses have tentacles? That's gotta be a new classic.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
But octopi only have eight arms? And they're not tentacles; you're thinking of squid.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
And you're OVERthinking this joke! Sheesh!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
No way. I am not messing with her!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Wow, tough customer...

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Because he's always lion!
