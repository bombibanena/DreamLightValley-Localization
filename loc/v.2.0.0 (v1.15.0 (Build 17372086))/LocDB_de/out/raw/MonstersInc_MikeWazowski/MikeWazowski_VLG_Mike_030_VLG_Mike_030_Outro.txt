Wow, what a meet and greet!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
You had a good time?

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
It was a blast! The Monsters, Inc. holiday parties have nothin' on this!

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
And it was good to see Vanellope.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
I'm a little disappointed that she's gonna go with prop humor, but we all have to start somewhere.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I like prop humor!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Yeah, she's young.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Well, you're not really a comic's comic, are ya?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Guess not...

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I just need to take her under my wing a little, teach her the finer points of comedy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Worth a shot.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Vanellope isn't really the "go under someone's wing" type.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Well, time to work on my set some more.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
You keep the <ActivityItem>Comedic Meet and Greet Decor</ActivityItem> though. Maybe it'll inspire you to work on your own routine!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Really? Thanks Mike!

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
You bet!

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Now if ya see me around the Village, know that I'm hard at work on my set!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Really? Even if you're fishing, or even just staring into the distance?

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
That's how the comedic mind turns, {PlayerName}! When we look like we're slacking off, that's when we're really doin' the work!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
If everything goes according to plan, folks here are gonna be laughing so hard nobody'll get anything done for days!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Really? Hmm... I'll have to give that some thought.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
She shows promise, though.
