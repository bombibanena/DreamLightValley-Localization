Today's the day, {PlayerName}!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Are you ready to laugh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Always!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Soon? Dealing with something else now.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Okay, here's an appetizer:

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
What's up with Dazzle Beach?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I don't know; what's up with Dazzle Beach?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's weird that it never smells like seaweed.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
I'm just sayin': It may be full of Dazzle, but where's the Razzle Beach too?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Boooooo.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I don't get it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Heh.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Oof, tough crowd.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Okay, okay... maybe I wasn't a fan of that one.

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
All right... That's fine. I'm still polishing my set. They can't all be winners, right? And like I tell my comedy students: It's important to get feedback!

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Hey, while I work on my set, can you go make sure Vanellope's ready to go on?

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
She's a kid, you know â might be dealing with some stage fright.

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Sure, see you in a bit!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Razzle dazzle? No?

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
That bad, huh?

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
I laughed!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
You exhaled forcefully. That was not a laugh.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
But I guess that's Dreamlight Magic at work?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
{PlayerName}... that's not how the bit works.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Oh, sorry! What's up with Dazzle Beach?
