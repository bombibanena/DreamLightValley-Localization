{PlayerName}, you got any ideas for where I should practice my jokes?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Right here!

At home. Alone.

All right! Tell me if you've heard this one...

What's worse than a centipede with athlete's foot? Me with pink eye!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Get it? 'Cause I have a giant eye. Ha! I crack me up sometimes.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
What? How would I know if my jokes are funny if no one's there to laugh at 'em?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Oh... Wait. I get it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
You're so sure that my jokes are funny you don't think I need to practice in front of an audience.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
You're the best, pal!
