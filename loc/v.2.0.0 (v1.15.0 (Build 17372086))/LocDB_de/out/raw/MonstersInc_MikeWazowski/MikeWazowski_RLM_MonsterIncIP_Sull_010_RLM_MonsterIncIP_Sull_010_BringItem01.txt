I have "The Wazowski Special" for you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Mollusk monsters make... uh... perfect purple pies?

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Yeah, just doin' my vocal warm-ups. Gotta get 'em in before I head through today's first kid door as Monsters, Inc.'s Top Jokester!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Oh, you brought my coffee? Sulley was right: You ARE a great intern!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Okay, warm-ups are done, and I've had a DELICIOUS Wazowski Special. Now the day can REALLY begin!

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
Prepare to observe the BEST Jokester in the biz!

What does a Jokester do exactly?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Excited to see you work, Mr. Wazowski!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Your humility is truly inspiring.

Jokesters, my friend, are the backbone of Monsters, Inc.! We make kids laugh, which creates laugh energy, which powers... everything!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
See, there was a time when everything was scream powered, and this place was ruled by Scarers, but NO MORE! Now it's my time to shine â all the time!

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Ya know this is basic energy knowledge. Don't you watch the news?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Oh, right! I knew that monster-y stuff. I just forgot!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't have a TV?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I musta missed that episode.

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
Don't sweat it! Consider your refresher complete!

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
{PlayerName}, are you ready to see the greatest Jokester of all time go to work?

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
WHAT?! How can you â uh, I mean, not my place to judge. Anywhoo...

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Episode! It was only like the biggest story to rock Monstropolis! But that's not why you're here...

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Hey, you called me Mister! I knew I liked you!

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Well, since it's the first day of the internship, you are in for a real treat. Mike Wazowski is about to perform!

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
Ya know how Sulley said we were coming up with the plan?

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Well, the plan is me workin' my green behind off to keep this place goin'!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Time to make 'em laugh!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Hey there, pal, I invented sarcasm! I know it when I hear it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
You'll understand why I'm the best soon enough. Just watch and learn!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
You are a LIFESAVER! I can't do top-notch Jokester work without my coffee.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
... OR my vocal warm-ups... Which is what I was doing by the way â not just talking to myself.

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Hey, that's another great vocal warm-up. I might use it next time!
