WE DID IT! LOOK AT THAT!

We beat it by miles! By kilometers! By whales!

Dreamlight Valley, here we come!

... By whales?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Thanks, pal! Couldn't have done it without you... Well, I could've done most of it, but definitely not all!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Yep, my burp tank never fails!

It's time to head to Dreamlight Valley, right?

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Almost. There's one last thing I gotta take care of.

In the meantime, maybe you could check on our hotel room? House? Beachside bungalow? We're not picky. Just be sure it's someplace nice.

Sulley works so hard, he deserves a head start on the R and R.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Can we go tell Sulley?

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
They're big, right?

There was an open encyclopedia on the book kid's desk. The point is, we did good. We make a great team!
