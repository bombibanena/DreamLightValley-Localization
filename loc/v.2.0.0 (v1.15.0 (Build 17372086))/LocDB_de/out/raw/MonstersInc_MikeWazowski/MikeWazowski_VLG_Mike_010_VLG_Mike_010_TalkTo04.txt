These are perfect, {PlayerName}!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Here, let me just mix 'em together...

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Do you have a special recipe or something?

Wazowski family secret! My mother passed it down to me before I left for college.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Good thinking!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That's quite an interesting gift for a college student.

That's my mother for ya â always lookin' out for me! Hey, if you ever run into her...

I should be able to water a handful of them, and the magical root network will carry the <ActivityItem>Monstrous De-Pollinator Solution</ActivityItem> to all the others!

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
That's great!

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
*sniff* Oh, and could ya <Lore>bring me some flowers after they've been de-pollened</Lore>? My place could use a little color.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Got it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
...tell her I made good use of it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Aaaaand, here you go!

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
Thanks for helpin' me deal with those nasty, pollen-filled flowers, {PlayerName}.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Sure! Putting it in my <ActivityItem>Royal Watering Can</ActivityItem> should do the trick.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
You're a lifesaver! Literally. All that pollen is... is... ACHOO! Ugh, it's killin' me!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
I know that watering every single flower in Dreamlight Valley is gonna be a tough task, but I appreciate you taking the time to help me!

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Well, fortunately Merlin recently told me that Dreamlight Magic links all of the flowers here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
What can I say? Some kids get handmade quilts, I got a botanical super formula.

Took a while to convince the campus gardeners to use it. But when they did, allergy visits to the infirmary went down 70%!
