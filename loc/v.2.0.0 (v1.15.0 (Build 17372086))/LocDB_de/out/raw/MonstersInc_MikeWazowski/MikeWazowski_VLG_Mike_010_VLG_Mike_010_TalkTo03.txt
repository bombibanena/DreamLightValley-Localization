<Italic>Hello Wazowski</Italic>...

TAG: MikeWazowski_034_f
AHH! Roz! What are you doing here? How did you get here?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_035_f
Mike, it's me, {PlayerName} â I'm wearing a Roz costume!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Oh, PHEW! The resemblance is uncanny.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
Until I saw your legs, I thought you were Roz!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's working! Let's keep going.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
<Italic>Wazowski</Italic>...

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
<Italic>Where's your paperwork, Wazowski?</Italic>

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Oh, I... was busy... and in another world... and the little animals here ate it. I'll get it done, promise!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
<Italic>Don't let it happen again.</Italic>

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
No, I'llâ

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
You know what? No, I don't have to take this!

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
You hear me, Roz? I'm done with your paperwork! Done, I say!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
<Italic>How daring of you, Wazowski</Italic>...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
<Italic>I'll take this to Waternoose if I have to</Italic>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
That's right! I'm the most daring, top-performing Jokester you've ever seen!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
This is your chance, Mike: Let it all out!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
We're so close to a breakthrough!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
<Italic>Is this really about paperwork, Wazowski? Dig deep, really open yourself up</Italic>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Hmm... well there is something else...

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
It's your hair! It's your hair, Roz!

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
My mother has the same hairstyle. Do you know what it's like to come into work every day and see your sweet mother's hairstyle on the bane of your existence?

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
Ahem, lemme get my best Roz voice going again...

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
<Italic>Wazowski... maybe your mother and I are besties. Maybe we're as close as sisters</Italic>.

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
<Italic>From now on, call me "Auntie Roz."</Italic>

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
Don't even joke about that.

TAG: MikeWazowski_022_f
You're not my boss, Roz! You don't even work at the factory anymore!

TAG: MikeWazowski_031_f
Now I can finally breathe! I feel restored! Rejuvenated!

TAG: MikeWazowski_032_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}! I think I can actually enjoy it here now.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
By the way, I heard that the Villagers try to show their thanks by giving you gifts?

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
Yeah, it happens sometimes, but don't feel compelled.

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
Oh, but I do. Here, take this!

TAG: MikeWazowski_037_f
One of the best from my collection.

TAG: Player_003_f
That's...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
...really gross, Mike.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
...a very unique gift!

TAG: MikeWazowski_023_f
If I wanna hand in my paperwork late, then you or Roze can go bug Sulley about it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
Yeah, go Mike â wait, what?

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
Sulley's the CEO. Paperwork's his problem. I am the TALENT!

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
Huh! I'm sure that helps. But... did THIS help? Do you feel better?

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
I... feel...

TAG: MikeWazowski_028_f
...SO MUCH BETTER!

TAG: MikeWazowski_029_f
Wow, {PlayerName}, that really did the trick!

TAG: MikeWazowski_030_f
Happy to help! We can't have our new visitors feeling anxious in their new home.

TAG: MikeWazowski_038_f
If dripping snot-filled tissues are gross to you, so be it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_039_f
Hope ya like it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_033_f
Since I'm no longer so anxious, or sneezing, I'm gonna see how we can make this place better than ever!

TAG: MikeWazowski_036_f
Well, I can't wait to see what you come up with! Talk to you later, Mike!

TAG: MikeWazowski_040_f
Well, the Wazowskis have a reputation for unique gift-giving!

TAG: MikeWazowski_041_f
So kind of you!

TAG: MikeWazowski_042_f
Hey, I'm just that kinda guy.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Waternoose? He's in jail! I don't have to care what that scream-sucking suit says anymore!
