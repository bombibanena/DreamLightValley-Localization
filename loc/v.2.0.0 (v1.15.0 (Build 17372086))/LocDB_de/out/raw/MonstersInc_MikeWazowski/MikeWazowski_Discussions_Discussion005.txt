I had another nightmare about paperwork!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Tell me about it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Kind of a boring nightmare...

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Every night I dream I need to file my paperwork, but I FORGET the system! Then, I remember it as soon as I wake up.

The pink copies go to accounting, fuchsia goes to purchasing, and the goldenrod ones go to records.

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
That seems complicated...

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
Right? Okay, pop quiz: Where do the fuchsia copies go?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Accounting.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Purchasing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Records.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Wrong! See what I mean? It's so stressful! And it's all memorization; no logic.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Exactly! And where do the goldenrod ones go?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Accounting.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Records.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
The trash.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
Nailed it! Whew. I'm feeling better about my next nightmare already.

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Ha! I'm saving that one for my next nightmare.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
Hey, believe me, I'd rather have bad dreams about scary clowns and taxes like everyone else!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
But nooo, every night it's Roz and the "fill these out in triplicate, Wazowski!" and "where do the pink copies go?"

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Yeesh. I gotta snap outta this!
