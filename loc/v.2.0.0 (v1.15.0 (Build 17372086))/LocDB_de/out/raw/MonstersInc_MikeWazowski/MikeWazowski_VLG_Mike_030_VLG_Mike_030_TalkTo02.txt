Mike, I'm back!

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Well, how'd it go? Don't keep me in suspense, here, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll give you the quick summary.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're gonna want to hear the details...

TAG: MikeWazowski_030_f
Vanellope knocked it out of the park â no contest.

TAG: MikeWazowski_031_f
She was excited, clever, motivated...

TAG: MikeWazowski_026_f
Then I think we've got our opener â Vanellope sounds great!

TAG: MikeWazowski_027_f
Why don't you <Lore>go talk to Sulley</Lore>? He and Vanellope have been hangin' out a lot.

TAG: MikeWazowski_028_f
He can probably give us tips for how to help Vanellope reach her true comic potential.

TAG: MikeWazowski_029_f
Sure, on it!

TAG: Player_002_f
I'll tell you about...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...the Fairy Godmother.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...WALLÂ·E.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...Vanellope.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
She's very sweet, but unfortunately, comedy isn't really her thing.

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Really? Are ya sure?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
I tried to tell her a "chicken crossing the road" joke and she asked if she could help it cross.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Ah... I see your point.

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
I tried to tell her a knock-knock joke and she wanted to know if her enchanted door could respond.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
I tried to tell her the "six afraid of seven" joke and she got concerned seven was being too mean.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Great! How'd he do?

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
I've got good news and bad news.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The good news is...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The bad news is...

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
He's got GREAT comedic timing.

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
Fantastic! What about the bad news?

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
His vocabulary is pretty limited. He communicates mostly by sounds and gestures.

TAG: MikeWazowski_015_f
Right. I hadn't considered that.

TAG: MikeWazowski_020_f
Well... sounds like WALLÂ·E would be great as part of a duo, but I'm gonna have to pass on givin' him a stand-up set.

TAG: MikeWazowski_021_f
Fair enough.

TAG: MikeWazowski_016_f
His vocabulary is pretty limited. He communicates mostly by sounds and gestures.

TAG: MikeWazowski_017_f
Right. I hadn't considered that.

TAG: MikeWazowski_018_f
What about the good news?

TAG: MikeWazowski_019_f
He's got great comedic timing!

TAG: MikeWazowski_023_f
She... was actually hilarious!

TAG: MikeWazowski_024_f
Really?

TAG: MikeWazowski_025_f
Yeah, she's funny, she's confident and she's excited about the possibility of performing...
