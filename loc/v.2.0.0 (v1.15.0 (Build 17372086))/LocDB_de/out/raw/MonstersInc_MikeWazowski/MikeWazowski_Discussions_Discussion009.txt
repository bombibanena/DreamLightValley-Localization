You know what the Valley needs?

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
More roads for cars!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Why?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
But we can walk everywhere.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I kind of like that there's no traffic here.

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
So I can drive my car! I have got the sweetest ride in all of Monstropolis!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Tell me about your car!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't like cars.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What about a bicycle?

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
She's red and fast and purrs like a puma.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
I'd take you for a ride sometime... if we had roads here. Just think about it!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
You don't?! But they're fast and shiny â what's not to like?

TAG: MikeWazowski_006_f
Wait... I know what this is. Sulley told you to say that, didn't he?

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
He just doesn't appreciate that a good vehicle is more than the energy it uses. It's... an extension of your personality. A statement.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
Do you know how funny I'd look on a bicycle?!

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
... Hey, maybe you're onto something!

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Sure, but walking's not as fun as driving!

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
And... I have got the sweetest ride in all of Monstropolis.

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Sure, but no traffic means no cars!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
And my car is the sweetest ride in Monstropolis.
