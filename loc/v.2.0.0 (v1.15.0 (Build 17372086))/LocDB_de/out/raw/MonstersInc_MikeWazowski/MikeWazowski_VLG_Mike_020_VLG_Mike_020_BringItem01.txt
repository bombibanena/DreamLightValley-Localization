Here we go, one <ActivityItem>Rotten Carp</ActivityItem>, as requested.

TAG: MikeWazowski_001_f
Hmm, let me give it a sniff...

TAG: MikeWazowski_002_f
*sniff sniff sniff*

TAG: MikeWazowski_003_f
{PlayerName}... it's perfect!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Awesome!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll take your word for it.

TAG: MikeWazowski_004_f
You gave it just the right amount of time to age!

The key to evaluating whether or not it's ready to use is all down to smell...

TAG: MikeWazowski_007_f
If it smells fishy, it's not ready yet.

TAG: MikeWazowski_008_f
But when you get top notes of ammonia and that dumpster sweetness, you know it's perfect!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm in awe of your scent knowledge!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I can't believe I'm doing this.

TAG: MikeWazowski_009_f
Well, my girlfriend Celia took me to a perfume-making class once.

TAG: MikeWazowski_011_f
So what's next?

TAG: MikeWazowski_012_f
Next, we gather the final Ingredients for the cologne!

TAG: MikeWazowski_013_f
We'll need an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem> to put the cologne in and <ActivityItem>Rich Soil</ActivityItem> for those earthy notes.

TAG: MikeWazowski_014_f
Once it's ready, we can <Lore>bring it to Mr. McDuck</Lore> and see if he wants to stock it for the other Villagers.

TAG: MikeWazowski_010_f
Hey, we're all beginners at some point!

TAG: MikeWazowski_005_f
Oh, you can trust me on this.
