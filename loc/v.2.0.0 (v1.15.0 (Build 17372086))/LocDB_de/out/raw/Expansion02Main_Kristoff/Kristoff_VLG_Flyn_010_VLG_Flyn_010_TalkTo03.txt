Hey, {PlayerName}! It's good to see you.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Hey Kristoff, do you have a second to help me out?

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
After everything you've done for me? Of course!

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
It's about Flynn. Maleficent placed him under a curse. Now I think he feels...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...lonely.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...heartbroken.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...sad.

He's fighting it, but it's clear he misses somebody, and being the Wolf of the Wilds really messed with his head.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Oof, that sounds rough. What can I do?

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
I was thinking you could lend an ear and get him to open up?

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
I'm happy to give it a try. Let's <Lore>go to Flynn's House</Lore> and see if he'll talk to me.
