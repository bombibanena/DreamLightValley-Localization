Ah, {PlayerName}, what can I do for you?

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
I'm helping Sulley bring back something called Monster Movie Night.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
He was wondering where your rental videotapes went.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Hmm... I did see him lookin' around the shop earlier.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Well, now you know what he was looking for!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why didn't you talk to him?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm surprised you didn't urge him to buy something.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Why didn't he just ask me?

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
I guess I'll have to ask each of them until I find who has it... Thanks, Mr. McDuck!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Sulley didn't want to bother you.

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Nonsense. I'm always here for my customers. Especially the paying ones!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
As for the tapes, I'm afraid I cannae offer that service anymore.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
How come?

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Because I was always havin' to chase the Villagers down to get 'em back! Eventually, I decided to cut my losses.

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
I suspect some Villagers still have tapes from before the Forgetting. And, if I remember correctly, one of 'em would be perfect for Monster Movie Night. "20,000 Giant Arachnids Under the Bed."

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
I don't remember exactly who has it, but it's either Ursula, Mickey, or Goofy.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Hmm... Though I do recall that whoever rented it did it for a special occasion with a special someone.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Well, I had another customer, and some Villagers don't like to be pestered while they browse.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Well, I had another customer. And they were contemplatin' a rather LARGE purchase, so I had to give 'em my undivided attention.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Why didn't Sulley ask me about the tapes?
