Why, {PlayerName}, what's this you're bringin' me?

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
It's the Valley's hottest new cologne! Designed by Mike Wazowski and yours truly.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Go on, give it a whiff!

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Why, certainly!

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
*sniff sniff* ...

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
What do you think?

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
{PlayerName}... I cannae find the words for how HORRID this smells!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh, that's a shame...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Try and find some. We want feedback!

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
Wait just a moment, {PlayerName}; I think I do have the words...

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
Try <Lore>Scar</Lore> and <Lore>Vanellope</Lore>. That seems like a disparate and representative sample to me!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
It smells worse than when my three great-nephews were all in nappies and got the stomach flu!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Oh...

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
AND it smells like Goofy left his catch in the sun for a week!

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
Actually, funny you say thatâ

TAG: Scrooge_014_f
Still... I am a businessman...

TAG: Scrooge_015_f
If ya can point me to a Villager that likes wearing your cologne, I'll consider stocking it. IF you put a triple seal on the bottles!

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
The customer is always right, after all!

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
Okay, I can work with this.
