So... I hear that you're Vanellope's manager now?

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Aye. The lass needed representation, and who am I to turn down a nice percentage?

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Is this the same kind of percentage that Gaston is giving you?

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
I... er... certainly hope not!

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
Now, acting as Vanellope's manager, I must inform you that the star has a contract rider that must be followed.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
Should her required items not be provided, she'll not perform.

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
How demanding!

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Between you and me, {PlayerName}, I quite agree.

TAG: Scrooge_013_f
But the talent makes the rules!

TAG: Player_001_f
So what does she want?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A scale model of Dreamlight Valley in candy?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
An arcade machine with every game in existence?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
For everyone in the Valley to dress like Ralph?

TAG: Scrooge_016_f
Och, no. Nothin' too extravagant.

TAG: Scrooge_017_f
She's grown rather fond of <ActivityItem>Cheesecake</ActivityItem>. So, be sure she has some on hand.

TAG: Scrooge_018_f
Okay, I guess I can swing that.

TAG: Scrooge_019_f
Talk to you later!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Well, hope you make your money's worth.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
As do I!
