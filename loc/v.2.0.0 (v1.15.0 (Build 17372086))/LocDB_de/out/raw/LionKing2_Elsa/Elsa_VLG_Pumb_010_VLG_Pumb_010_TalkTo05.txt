Elsa... I heard you left Chez Remy this morning when Timon and Pumbaa came in...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Please, tell me what happened. You can be honest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you mad at Pumbaa?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Guessing that wasn't a coincidence.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
I... I hate to say it, but Pumbaa's breath is... very strong.

TAG: Elsa_008_f
Daisy did mention a smell.

TAG: Elsa_013_f
I know it's not his fault. I hope you can help him.

TAG: Elsa_016_f
Huh... Maybe it's something he's eating? I'll <Lore>talk to Remy</Lore>.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Hmm... I guess they don't really brush their teeth out in the jungle. Which isn't a problem until you're somewhere they DO brush all the time.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I finished my meal and left as quickly as I could. I'm so sorry he noticed.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
Don't worry, Elsa. Pumbaa wants our help with this. Thank you for being honest.

TAG: Elsa_015_f
I'm going to <Lore>talk to Daisy</Lore> to get some more info.

TAG: Elsa_003_f
Not at all. Pumbaa's wonderful! So friendly and positive. But... he WAS also part of the reason I left.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
No. It wasn't.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
I really love Pumbaa. But his breath...
