Hey, {PlayerName}! Are you still helping Mike out with his cologne?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Ah well, worth a shot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is that good or bad?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I guess that means Mike will love it.

TAG: Remy_001_f
We've moved on to making tasty treats, and as the Village's culinary expert, we'd love to get your opinion!

TAG: Remy_002_f
Oh wow, what did you make?

TAG: Remy_003_f
It's a spin on one of Mike's favs from back home.

TAG: Remy_004_f
A <ActivityItem>Gourmet Rot Dog</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Remy_005_f
Okay...

TAG: Remy_006_f
Here, have a bite!

{PlayerName}, I'm sorry, but this tastes like garbage.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Hey, you can learn a lot from what goes wrong.

TAG: Remy_013_f
I'm sure you worked hard on this.

TAG: Remy_014_f
And no shame to garbage â my family and I ate LOTS of garbage before I became a chef.

TAG: Remy_015_f
But I'm happy that that chapter of my life is done.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Fair enough!

TAG: Remy_017_f
Why don't you <Lore>bring it back to Mike</Lore>? I'm sure he'll enjoy it.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Well, from my perspective...

TAG: Remy_011_f
It's not great.

TAG: Remy_012_f
I gotta say: I am fascinated by his palate.
