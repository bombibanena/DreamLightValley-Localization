Hello, {PlayerName}! Hmm... by the look on your face, I suspect you have a question for me.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
I do. Mulan is putting together something called a shadow play to show the Village and...

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Oh, I just love shadow plays!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
You know about them?

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Of course. I'm interested in all sorts of arts. And shadow plays are beautiful! Let me guess... Mulan would like some help with the <ActivityItem>Shadow Puppets</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, it'd help A LOT.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you think you can make them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Were you spying on Mulan and me?

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Well, I'd love to make them.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
She wants to regale us with the journey she and Mushu took back to their Realm during the Forgetting.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
Oh, that'll be fascinating!

TAG: Minnie_000_f
I'll get started on the puppets right away and bring them to Mulan once I'm finished.

TAG: Minnie_014_f
Thanks, Minnie!

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Absolutely. You just need to tell me what the story's about.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
No, I'd never do that. But Mulan has told me before that sewing and crafts aren't exactly her forte.
