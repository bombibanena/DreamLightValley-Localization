Oh! Thank you, {PlayerName}. These meals look incredible!

I wish I could eat them myself, but... if I'm gonna make friends with all those birds in the Forgotten Lands, I'd better save it all for them.

Why are you trying to befriend the birds?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Those birds sure are picky.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hey, as long as somebody eats them, it's all good.

My cousin Antonio wants to hear about ALL the animals in the Valley.

TAG: Mirabel_003_f
So, he asked me to make friends with them. But those birds are tough.

TAG: Mirabel_006_f
Thanks again for your help, {PlayerName}. And please, take this for your trouble.

TAG: Mirabel_004_f
You're telling me. Before now, I thought only my cousin Antonio could make friends with them. But thanks to these meals, I think I've got a pretty good shot.

TAG: Mirabel_005_f
Don't worry. Those birds are gonna love them. And I'll finally be able to tell Antonio that I made friends with every animal in the Valley.
