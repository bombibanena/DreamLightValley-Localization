Would I joke about that?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
No, you seem quite serious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Well, you are an aspiring comic...

TAG: Vanellope_000_f
Looks cheesy, and cakey... This will do, my good friend!

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
So you're back to being able to perform?

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Well... maybe.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
I've been thinking, {PlayerName}. If I'm the future of comedy, how come I'm opening for Mike?

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
Oh, I bet he'd say something about paying your dues...

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
Yeah, what's up with that old-fashioned nonsense? If I've got the talent, who cares how long I've been performing?

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Tell Wazowski that either we go up as dual headliners, or I don't go up at all.

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Seriously?

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
I'll let Mike know!

TAG: Vanellope_010_f
This is about business!

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
And today, I'm very serious about business!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
Okay, I'll inform Mike.
