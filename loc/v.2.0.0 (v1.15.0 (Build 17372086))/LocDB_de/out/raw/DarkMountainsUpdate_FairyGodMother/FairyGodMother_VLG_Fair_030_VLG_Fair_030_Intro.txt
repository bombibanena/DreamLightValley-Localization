{PlayerName}, thank goodness you're here! May I ask you to take up the mantle of substitute fairy godparent once again?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure! I love it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Some other time.

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
Oh, that makes me so happy!

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
You see, I'm afraid I got a bit turned around and completely forgot something I meant to do for Minnie.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I feel like you're overworking.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How many people are you helping?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe you need a planner or something?

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
Nonsense, child. A fairy godparent is never overworked.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
Though we do appreciate a bit of help on occasion. Such as now.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
Would you prepare a nice comforting cup of <ActivityItem>Peppermint Tea</ActivityItem> for Minnie?

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
I can do that.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
Splendid! Here's the <ActivityItem>Recipe</ActivityItem>.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
Why, everyone, of course! I may be Cinderella's fairy godmother, but a fairy godparent helps all they can.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Which, I suppose is how I find myself in my present predicament. I've obligations elsewhere, but I wanted to bring Minnie a nice, comforting cup of <ActivityItem>Peppermint Tea</ActivityItem>.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Could you see to it for me?

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
A planner...? Oh, you mean a book! Yes, an enchanted book of tasks would help me keep track of everything...

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
But I'm afraid it won't help with the problem of the day...

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
Whenever you've time, my dear!
