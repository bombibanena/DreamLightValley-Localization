Thank you, dear! I hope Minnie liked the <ActivityItem>Peppermint Tea</ActivityItem> you brought her.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
Well, I'd say it's very useful! I'll go help Minnie with her magical problem right away.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Oh, but then I'll be late to help the other Villagers...

TAG: Player_000_f
Let me deal with it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I love playing with magic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sure I can help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm getting pretty used to fixing this kind of problem!

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
She did, but she's having a little problem with the <ActivityItem>Phonograph</ActivityItem> you enchanted for her.

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
Oh dear. Is my magic misbehaving?

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
That will never do.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
Tell me, {PlayerName}, what is the enchantment doing?

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
Here, look at this.

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
A picture?! Gracious! How did you do this?

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
It's called a camera. It makes... magical paintings.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Well, then it's settled. And you know... there may be a way to enchant your "camera" so it not only creates these still images, but can also keep my enchantments in their proper state.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Now then, what could we use...

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
Hmm...

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
Oh! Let's start with <ActivityItem>Diamonds</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Crystals</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem> to reveal the enchantment.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
Then add <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> to seal the spell.

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
I'll need a <ActivityItem>Lens</ActivityItem> I can add to my Camera. Maybe WALLÂ·E has one to spare. I'll ask him.

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
Wonderful! Once you have everything, bring it to me, and I'll enchant your <ActivityItem>Lens</ActivityItem> to add my magic to yours. Oh-ho-ho! This is going to be a marvel, indeed!

TAG: FairyGodMother_017_f
Of course you can, dear. And you know... there may be a way to enchant your "camera" so it not only creates these still images but can also keep my enchantments in their proper state.

TAG: FairyGodMother_018_f
And you're very good at it, {PlayerName}. That's why everyone seeks your help.

TAG: FairyGodMother_019_f
Now, there may be a way to enchant your "camera" so it not only creates these still images but can also keep my enchantments in their proper state.
