{PlayerName}! Something's happened, hasn't it?

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
The sky above the Valley seems to be... opening.

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
Wait a moment... What's happened to the <ActivityItem>Orb of Remembrance</ActivityItem>?

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
The Forgotten showed up and stole it from me.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
The Forgotten?! Oh dear.

TAG: Player_000_f
That's not all. The Forgotten is planning some sort of spell to tear down the wall between Dreamlight Valley and the dark side.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
None of it made any sense.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
A spell so "no one will ever be lonely again."

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
Goodness. They want to rend the fabric of reality? Tear down the wall between one world and the next?

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
That's a very dangerous sort of magic!

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
With just the slightest slip, the Forgotten could destroy... everything!

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
You mean... all of Dreamlight Valley?

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
No. I mean EVERYTHING.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Dreamlight Valley. The dark side. The Here and There. The Realms...

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Perhaps even the waking world.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I didn't sign up for this!!!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I am FREAKING OUT.

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
No lost inner child of mine is going to destroy the universe. I know I can stop this.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
It's difficult magic, dear. For now, Dreamlight Valley is safe and stable. But we must do what we can while we're able!

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
Soon, you'll have no choice but to cross to the dark side of Dreamlight Valley and confront the Forgotten.

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
I'll consult with Merlin on how we might do that. In the meantime, you should do what you've always done.

TAG: FairyGodMother_017_f
Keep taking care of Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
I'm just having a bit of trouble processing the fact that my lost inner child is about to ACCIDENTALLY DESTROY THE UNIVERSE.
