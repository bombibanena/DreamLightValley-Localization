Now, what in the world did I do with that... It's not in my pockets... Not in either of my sleeves...

TAG: FairyGodMother_001_f
Where could it possibly...

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
Ah! {PlayerName}! Just who I hoped to see. Would you be a dear and help me grant a few wishes?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, of course.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm sorry, I can't right now.

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
Marvelous! I'm sorry to ask, but I simply cannot find a <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> that Merlin lent me.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
You see, he's asked after it, but it seems to have sprouted legs and run off! ... Oh! Not that I mean actual legs, dear... though I suppose a book of Merlin's might do that...

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
Where was I... Oh yes! Other Villagers are waiting for my help...

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
Could you aid them in my stead while I look for <ActivityItem>Merlin's Book</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Just point me in the right direction!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How many wishes are we talking about?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You haven't forgotten who needs your help, have you?

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
Oh, thank you! Now, it's nothing too complicated. You shouldn't have any trouble making these wishes come true.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
First, our dear friend Anna feels a bit under the weather. Some <ActivityItem>Pumpkin Soup</ActivityItem> should make it all better.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Here, take this <ActivityItem>Recipe</ActivityItem> in case you need it.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Now who else... Oh! Ursula was in need of <ActivityItem>Amethysts</ActivityItem> and that delightful Olaf fellow would like a pile of <ActivityItem>Sticks</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Okay, got it.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Why sticks?

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
Thank you, dear. Now, I'll go look for that <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem>...

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
You know, I haven't the faintest idea.

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
He did say something about a project of some sort. And he seemed quite amused by it all. I'm sure you'll find out.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
Well, good luck, {PlayerName}! I'm off to look for that <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem>!

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
Oh, no more than two or three. You shouldn't have any problem fulfilling these wishes.

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
Goodness no! I could never forget a thing like that. And you shouldn't have any problem granting these wishes.

TAG: FairyGodMother_017_f
I understand. You've much to do already. Just let me know if you find the time.
