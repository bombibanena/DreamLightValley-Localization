Goodness, what did you find in the Forgotten's second Memory?

TAG: FairyGodMother_002_f
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

TAG: Player_000_f
Not a ghost. Just a Gothel...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She betrayed the Forgotten.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She showed the Forgotten how to be cruel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She led the Forgotten down a bad path.

TAG: FairyGodMother_003_f
The Forgotten trusted her and she... she tried to do something horrible.

TAG: FairyGodMother_007_f
Oh, I'm so sorry, dear. When we feel alone, that's often when we're most vulnerable.

TAG: FairyGodMother_010_f
Now, I don't know if this brings us any closer to saving the Valley. But perhaps now you understand the Forgotten a bit better...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
The Forgotten's pain is becoming so real to me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't think I'll ever understand.

TAG: FairyGodMother_011_f
How could the Forgotten ever trust anyone again after what Mother Gothel did?

TAG: FairyGodMother_012_f
Once all this is over... I'm going to need to have a little talk with her.

TAG: FairyGodMother_018_f
Trust is fragile, dear. We must beware. Once broken, it's difficult to repair.

TAG: FairyGodMother_015_f
Now then, I'm afraid we still don't have all the answers we need.

TAG: FairyGodMother_017_f
But perhaps we'll find them through this final gate. <Lore>Follow me</Lore>.

TAG: FairyGodMother_013_f
The Forgotten never should have fallen for Mother Gothel's trick in the first place.

TAG: FairyGodMother_014_f
Nothing excuses all the destruction they caused around here.

TAG: FairyGodMother_016_f
Perhaps not. But we must always have compassion for those who are hurting.

TAG: FairyGodMother_004_f
The Forgotten learned a horrible lesson from her.

TAG: FairyGodMother_005_f
How to be selfish and use people for your own ends.

TAG: FairyGodMother_008_f
Oh dear. I'm afraid that sometimes when we're hurt... it can be rather easy to turn that hurt towards others.

TAG: FairyGodMother_006_f
She showed the Forgotten how to remove the Orbs from the Pillars. That's how the Forgotten learned about all of that.

TAG: FairyGodMother_009_f
Of course... it's when we feel most alone that we behave rashly, trying to find any possible way to extinguish our unhappiness.
