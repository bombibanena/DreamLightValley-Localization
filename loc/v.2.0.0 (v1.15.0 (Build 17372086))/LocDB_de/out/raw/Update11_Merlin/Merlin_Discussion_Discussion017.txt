Could I learn to be a wizard?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Well, you clearly have magical ability. But the question you must ask is "why do you WANT to be a wizard?"

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
To be powerful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
To learn.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I want a cool hat like yours.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Then no. Likely not. A true wizard seeks to help others, not overpower them.

Then you are already on the path.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
You need not become a wizard for that, {PlayerName}.

You may wear whatever hat you wish.
