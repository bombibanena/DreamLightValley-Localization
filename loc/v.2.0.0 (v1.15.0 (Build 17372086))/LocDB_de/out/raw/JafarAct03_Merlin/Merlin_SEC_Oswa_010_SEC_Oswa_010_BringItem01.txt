Hey Merlin, I've got a bit of a quandary for you â think you can help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What kind of information?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Go on...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sounds like you're stumped.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Certainly, {PlayerName}. By any chance, does this relate to the Bermuda Triangle and its suitability as a holiday destination? You see, I've recentlyâ

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Uhh, not exactly. Check this out...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Yes, let's take a closer look â what have we here...

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Extraordinary! The Dreamlight Magic in these pieces of the landscape has been tampered with.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Yeah, they're also extremely flat.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
How right you are!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Oswald messed up, and I'm trying to figure out how to reverse this. Any ideas?

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Hmm... I've a few ideas we might try. Reverse-hexes, asking them nicely... But we'll need more information first.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
{PlayerName}, I'm afraid that the magic governing the shape and dimension of these items has been compromised.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
And well... geometrical and dimensional magics are not exactly my forte.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
That's not good. You think there's a danger of this spreading?

TAG: Merlin_014_f
I certainly hope not!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Hmm... Perhaps you should look about <Lore>Jafar's Palace</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
As dastardly as he may be, he's extremely intelligent.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
And Jafar spent a very long time on Eternity Isle. I'm certain he understands its nature better than anyone. If you could find some of his notes, we may be able to fix this.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
In the meantime, I will attempt to wrestle some sense from these strange objects!

TAG: Merlin_018_f
I'll go take a look. Thanks, Merlin.
