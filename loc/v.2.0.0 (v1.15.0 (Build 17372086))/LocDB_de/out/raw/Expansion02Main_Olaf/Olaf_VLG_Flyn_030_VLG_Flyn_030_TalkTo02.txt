Hey Olaf, if I invited you to join a team Flynn and I are putting together, what would you say?

TAG: Olaf_001_f
I'd say sign me up! What do I need to do?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
How would you feel about squeezing through tight spaces and making a fire?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Hmm... The only squeezing I really do is hugging. And even with my permafrost, Elsa said I should be careful around fire. Which is actually good advice for everyone.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Fair enough, Olaf! I'll see you later.
