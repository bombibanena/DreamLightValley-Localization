Hey, Olaf. There's something we need to talk about...

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Ooo, are we about to have a difficult and grown-up conversation about a serious topic?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
I'm so excited!

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Ahem. I will endeavor to display the utmost maturity. Proceed...

TAG: Player_000_f
You've been spending a LOT of time talking to the Lorekeeper.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She's tired and she needs some rest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We think you'd benefit from also having another hobby.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe you should diversify your fun-fact sources.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Oh. I had noticed that her fun facts are getting less fun and less frequent each time we speak.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Maybe I should take up a new hobby for when she's too tired to talk.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
But what sort of hobby could it be...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Fountain construction?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Owls?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Secret rooms?

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Fountains ARE fascinating. But I think the wildlife here is even more interesting!

TAG: Olaf_020_f
Maybe the owls around the Bind would be a worthy topic of study...

TAG: Olaf_012_f
I don't know much about them. But ignorance is the first step on the journey to knowledge.

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Birdwatching could be an excellent source of new facts and information!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I could find you a book on owls?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I could get you a pair of binoculars?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I could make you an owl stuffed animal?

TAG: Player_002_choice_003_f
We'll need to get a look at an owl up close.

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Oh, I would love that! But I also want to watch the cute little feathery owls up close.

TAG: Olaf_017_f
Maybe I should try feeding one...

TAG: Olaf_018_f
Uh, let me handle that. Your nose might look like a delicious treat to an owl.

TAG: Olaf_019_f
*gasp* You're right, {PlayerName}! Maybe you can <Lore>feed the owls in the Bind</Lore> while I go consult an owl expert.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
Oh, I don't need binoculars! I want to get up close to the cute little feathery owls...

TAG: Olaf_016_f
While I would love that, I'm afraid it's no replacement for close observation of the real thing.

TAG: Olaf_021_f
That's what I was thinking!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
*gasp* The owls in the Bind are so fascinating!

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Secret rooms are interesting, but after spending so much time stuck in the one in the Valley, I'd like to diversify my studies.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Another hobby? How exciting!

TAG: Olaf_007_f
You know, you're right! A new hobby could provide an endless assortment of new fun facts!
