Hey Olaf. I found these notes lying around. I think they're yours.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
*gasp* You found them! Thank you, {PlayerName}. These notes are my chronicle of new fun facts I'm learning from the Bind.

A whole world made of books is a whole world made of facts!

As soon as I got here, I tripped on something and landed face down on a path of books, and then I learned all about the life cycle of the bumblebee!

You must have been buzzing with excitement.

Have you met the Lorekeeper yet? She knows lots of fun facts!

OHHH! Buzzing! Like a bee. That's hilarious.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Have you met the Lorekeeper? You two would probably hit it off.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
She's a talking book who knows all sorts of stories.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Oh, I've met the Lorekeeper. She's already taught me so many fascinating pieces of information.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
I'd venture to say that she's now one of my very best friends!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
In fact, I'm headed her way right now! Won't you join me for some intellectually stimulating conversation?
