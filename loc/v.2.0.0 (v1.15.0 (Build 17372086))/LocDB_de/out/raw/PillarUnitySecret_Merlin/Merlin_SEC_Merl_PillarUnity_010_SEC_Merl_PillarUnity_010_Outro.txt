Something weird just happened. I put all the Pillars from around the Valley near Skull Rock and... it started to shake.

Is something inside there?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are the Pillars and that place connected somehow?!

I hope I didn't trigger some sort of ancient curse...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Oh dear. That is peculiar.

I haven't the foggiest idea what it could mean. I must look into this right away! Scour the library, review my previous research...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Yes, yes... I'll let you know if I uncover anything.
