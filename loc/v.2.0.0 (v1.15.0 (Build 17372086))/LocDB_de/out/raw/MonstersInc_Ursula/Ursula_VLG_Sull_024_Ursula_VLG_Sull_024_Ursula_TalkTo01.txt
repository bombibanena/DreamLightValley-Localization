Ah, angelfish, there you are! I need an assistant for Sullivan's silly little contest.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm glad you want to help the community!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm surprised by your decision.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
So what's your real endgame?

TAG: Ursula_002_f
AH-HA-HA-HA!

TAG: Ursula_014_f
I'll need 3 vials of the <ActivityItem>Perfume</ActivityItem> so I can add each Villager's special Ingredient. Bring them to me as soon as you can.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
My dear sweet child, you can be so innocent...

TAG: Ursula_007_f
That great blue lug went around the whole Valley advertising his ridiculous contest. But if I win, it's free publicity!

TAG: Ursula_008_f
And the only thing I have to do is impress a bunch of Villagers. It'll be like stealing candy from a baby!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
Hm... What do you have in mind?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
The perfect gift of one of my custom perfumes for a few select Villagers! I'll formulate each to smell like their favorite thing in Valley.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
I need you to procure me the <ActivityItem>Perfume</ActivityItem>, angelfish.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
What exactly goes into a magic perfume, Ursula?

TAG: Ursula_013_f
A few select ingredients. Gather some <ActivityItem>Seaweed</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Purple Hydrangeas</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Purple Rising Penstemons</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Empty Vials</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
You shouldn't be, sweetness.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
I'm never one to turn down an opportunity when it floats my way.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
This is what I like about you, child. You're not as gullible as the other fools around here.
