See? It's damaged, but the frame is good.

I'm sure we can repair it. And then we can fish and sail around the island.

TAG: Moana_006_f
And maybe... explore?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That sounds fantastic.

Why would you want to leave? This island has everything you need.

TAG: Moana_002_f
I'm glad you want to join me. Everything I've seen here is strange and... wonderful!

TAG: Moana_003_f
So, who knows what other fantastic places are beyond the horizon?

TAG: Moana_005_f
Places we can find â once we repair this boat!

TAG: Moana_001_f
Sure, but the sea... Wait.

TAG: Moana_007_f
You're making fun of me, aren't you? Ooh, I bet it was Maui!

TAG: Moana_008_f
Well, never mind that. I'll forgive you. If you help me fix the boat.
