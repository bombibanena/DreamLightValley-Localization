{PlayerName}, I've been thinking about you. You know all those <ActivityItem>Leader Shards</ActivityItem> we've been collecting?

TAG: Moana_012_f
I finally remembered what they're for. Want to know?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yes, definitely!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't have time right now.

TAG: Moana_000_f
On my island, Motunui, we have a tradition.

TAG: Moana_003_f
We don't have one on the island, so we should build it.

TAG: Moana_009_f
There's one more thing...

TAG: Moana_010_f
What's that?

TAG: Moana_011_f
I think you should be honored as a leader alongside me. Because...

TAG: Moana_001_f
You're a great leader.

TAG: Moana_015_f
Thank you. It means a lot to hear you say that.

TAG: Moana_016_f
But if you want me to be a part of this, you'll have to go back to the island where we met.

TAG: Moana_017_f
My Shard should be a conch shell.

TAG: Moana_018_f
If you find one, use it when you build the Honored Place.

TAG: Moana_019_f
That way, I'll always be with you. We'll support each other.

TAG: Moana_029_f
On the tallest mountain, there's a stack of stones.

TAG: Moana_020_f
When you've got everything, find a spot for the Honored Place near your home and come find me.

TAG: Moana_021_f
Oh, and here. Take the <ActivityItem>Leader Shards</ActivityItem> back. You'll need them to complete the celebration.

TAG: Moana_002_f
Each new chief lays their own stone on the stack.

TAG: Moana_006_f
When you do, you raise the whole island higher.

TAG: Moana_013_f
Now I see that the <ActivityItem>Leader Shards</ActivityItem> are like those stones.

TAG: Moana_014_f
Each one is an act of leadership. And together, they make you a leader.

TAG: Moana_022_f
So we need to stack the <ActivityItem>Leader Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Moana_030_f
Yes. But it's more than that.

TAG: Moana_007_f
We need to stack the Leader Shards in an Honored Place.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Okay â I'll tell you later.
