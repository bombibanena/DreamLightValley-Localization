When I miss Gramma Tala, I go to the ocean shore. She loved to dance in the shallows.

What do you do when you miss someone?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I tell stories about them!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I call my friends to hang out with them.

TAG: Moana_002_f
That's really smart. We tell lots of stories on Motunui. Gramma Tala was an amazing storyteller.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What kinds of stories did she tell?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Do YOU tell stories now?

Did you have a favorite story?

TAG: Moana_004_f
All kinds. But her favorite was about our history. How Maui stole the heart of Te Fiti and about the demon who tried to get it back! Some of my friends used to get scared, but I was just excited.

TAG: Moana_005_f
I do! My favorites are the scary ones about the Realm of Monsters! Not that I want to scare anyone. Unless they like that!

TAG: Moana_006_f
I do. It's about how Gramma Tala came to me when I lost my way. She really helped.

TAG: Moana_003_f
I have a lot of people to talk to, too. But Gramma Tala was... different. She really understood me.

What did you like best about her?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Do you think you're like her?

TAG: Moana_007_f
She didn't care if people thought she was different. She was just so much... herself.

TAG: Moana_008_f
I hope so. I try to follow my heart. I think she did that too.
