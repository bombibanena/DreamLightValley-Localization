I'm not sure if I'll go sailing today. It depends on the weather.

Have you sailed in storms?

What's the best weather for sailing?

TAG: Moana_001_f
A few. It's dangerous.

TAG: Moana_003_f
...and maybe a little bit exciting.

It depends on what you're doing. Cloudy days are good for fishing.

The sun feels amazing, but you want to make sure you have some shade.

So it's good that you can use a sail for shade when you need it.
