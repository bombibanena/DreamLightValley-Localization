Hey, {PlayerName}. What's that <Lore>Stone Slab</Lore> for?

TAG: Moana_007_f
Well, I have sort of a weird question to ask you.

TAG: Moana_006_f
Sure. What is it?

TAG: Moana_010_f
I need you to hold on to that <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> and tell me how you feel when you go sailing on the ocean.

TAG: Moana_011_f
Okay. That's a little strange, but I always love to talk about sailing.

TAG: Moana_001_f
When I'm out on the ocean with the salt air whipping around me and the wind in my sails, headed for the horizon, I know I'm where I belong.

TAG: Moana_002_f
It's the greatest feeling in the world!

TAG: Player_001_f
The way you describe it... it sounds so...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
...amazing! I want to go sailing.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
...scary! I'll stick to dry land.

TAG: Moana_012_f
I'm sure you'd love it.

TAG: Moana_014_f
Hey... that <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> you gave me... It's starting to glow. Does that mean I helped?

TAG: Moana_015_f
Yes! It worked! Now I just need to find somebody who's got <Lore>Seething Anger</Lore>...

TAG: Moana_004_f
<Lore>Seething Anger</Lore>? Well, Ursula gets pretty mad if you mention Ariel around her.

TAG: Moana_016_f
Ursula! That's a great idea.

TAG: Moana_013_f
It can be at first, but once you know what you're doing, it's fantastic!
