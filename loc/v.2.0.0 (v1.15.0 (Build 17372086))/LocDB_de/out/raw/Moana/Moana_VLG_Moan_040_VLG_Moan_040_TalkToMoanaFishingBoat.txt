Look, someone tried to open the coconuts but didn't manage to do it. I bet it's Pua!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Great news! Where did Pua go?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How do you know? It's just sand and <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Moana_001_f
Not to the Beach, that's for sure.

TAG: Moana_005_f
Could you track Pua, and I'll stay in case my friend comes back here?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
To find a pig, we must think like a pig. Oink!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't know where Pua could have gone...

TAG: Moana_003_f
That's smart, {playerName}. Pigs are good trackers!

TAG: Moana_010_f
Pua will be thirsty after trying to open all those coconuts... Try to find a place where Pua would feel safe that has plenty of fresh water.

TAG: Player_003_f
To get fresh water, I think Pua went to...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
The Meadow.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
The Forest.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
The Swamp?

TAG: Moana_007_f
Yes, good idea! Please check there.

TAG: Moana_008_f
Hmm... maybe some place with more light but still close to the Beach. Remember, Pua's from Motunui too.

TAG: Moana_009_f
No, that would be too scary.

TAG: Moana_004_f
I do. Pua would've been thirsty after trying to open the coconuts... Look for a place where Pua would feel safe that has plenty of fresh water.

When you grow up with a pig, you know how to recognize the signs.
