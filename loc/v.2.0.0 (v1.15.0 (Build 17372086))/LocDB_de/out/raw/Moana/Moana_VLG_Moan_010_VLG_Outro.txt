Did you find the thing that fell out of the boat?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's beautiful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What is it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It might be dangerous.

TAG: Moana_001_f
Wow. It is. I guess it's some kind of shard... Huh. Somehow it's... familiar.

TAG: Moana_012_f
That's strange. Well, I'll keep it secure for now, until we figure out what to do with it.

TAG: Moana_011_f
I'll also try to gather some information about it.

TAG: Moana_013_f
Don't forget to check the boat. I'll leave the fish I catch here. Take whatever you need!

TAG: Moana_002_f
I'm not sure. But it's somehow... familiar.

TAG: Moana_003_f
You're right. We should be careful. But it seems so... familiar.
