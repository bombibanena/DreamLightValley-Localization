Hey, {PlayerName}! I was exploring some of the caves on Dazzle Beach earlier.

TAG: Moana_001_f
If you haven't visited them already, you definitely should. Some of the artifacts in there are so beautiful!

TAG: Moana_003_f
I wonder who built them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Merlin?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Goofy?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Somebody we don't know.

TAG: Moana_002_f
I asked Merlin about them.

TAG: Moana_004_f
He kept muttering "Curious, curious..." and went to his library.

TAG: Moana_005_f
So I don't think it was him.

TAG: Moana_006_f
Hm, I don't think Goofy would build something like what I saw in those caves.

TAG: Moana_007_f
But I'll ask him. Maybe he knows about them.

TAG: Moana_008_f
You're probably right. Whoever built the artifacts in those caves must've lived here a really long time ago, before any of us got here.

TAG: Moana_010_f
I wonder who they were?

TAG: Moana_009_f
We should be careful not to disturb anything down there... but it's amazing to see what they made.
