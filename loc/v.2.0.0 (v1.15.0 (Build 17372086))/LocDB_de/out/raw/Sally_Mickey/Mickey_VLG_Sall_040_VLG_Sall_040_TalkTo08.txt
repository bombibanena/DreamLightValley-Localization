Hiya, {PlayerName}! How are ya?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Well, I'm actually coming to talk to you about something rather serious.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Uh-oh. What's the matter?

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Well... have you been in contact with Ursula at all recently?

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Actually, I have! It was kinda odd. She said she was getting a present ready for me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's a trap!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd stay away from her for the time being...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do you know anything about this present?

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Are ya sure?

TAG: Mickey_009_f
I'm gonna level with you, Mickey. Sally has been having visions, and we think that Ursula is up to something.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Visions? Like... dreams?

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Sort of?

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Oh... Well, that doesn't mean whatever Sally saw is certain to come true, right?

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Seriously, Mickey, we're trying to warn you about something dire!

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Thanks, pal. It sure is nice of you and Sally to worry about me. But until we know something for sure, I don't wanna assume anything bad.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Oh. But I wouldn't wanna be rude for no reason.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Well, no. Presents are supposed to be a surprise.
