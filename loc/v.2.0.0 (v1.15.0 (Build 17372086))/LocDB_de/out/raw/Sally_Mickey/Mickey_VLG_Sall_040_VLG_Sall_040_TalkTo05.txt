Gosh, that... that was close.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
I gotta thank you and Sally for saving us!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Happy to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you all right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you going to believe Sally next time?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
I don't wanna think about what kinda trouble we'd have been in if you two didn't show up.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Well, I'm happy that you're all right, Mickey.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Talk to you later, okay?

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Sure! And actually... could <Lore>you and Sally come by my House later</Lore>?

TAG: Mickey_008_f
No problem!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Yeah. I'm fine now. But we'd have been in big trouble if you two hadn't been there.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
You bet! We'd have been in big trouble if you two hadn't been there.
