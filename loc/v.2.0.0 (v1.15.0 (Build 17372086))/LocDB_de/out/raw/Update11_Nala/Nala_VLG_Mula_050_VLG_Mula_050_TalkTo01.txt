{PlayerName}, I'm glad you're here. I was just about to investigate my clue... *sniff* *sniff*

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What does it smell like?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You smelled it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can I smell it too?

TAG: Nala_003_f
Hm... Like <Lore>salt, fish, and sand</Lore>...

TAG: Nala_008_f
Could you look somewhere that has all three? And since it might be in the water, bring your Fishing Rod.

TAG: Nala_007_f
I'll find the flag, Nala! Don't worry!

TAG: Nala_002_f
Of course. That's how lions find out a lot of information. I can say for certain that our clue smells like <Lore>salt, fish, and sand</Lore>.

TAG: Nala_004_f
All right... I'm not sure you'll get anything, though. Lions have VERY powerful noses.

TAG: Nala_001_f
And mine tells me <Lore>salt, fish, and sand</Lore>... are our clue.
