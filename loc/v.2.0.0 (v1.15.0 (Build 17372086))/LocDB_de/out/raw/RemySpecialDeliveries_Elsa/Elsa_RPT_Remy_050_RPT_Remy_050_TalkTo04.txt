{PlayerName}, I'm glad to see you! I've been thinking... I'd like to get to know my neighbors around the Village a bit more.

TAG: Elsa_001_f
Do you have any advice?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Attend social events.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Find things you've got in common.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Put yourself out there.

TAG: Elsa_002_f
That's a wonderful idea. Are there any you know about soon?

TAG: Elsa_003_f
The Fairy Godmother is having a pumpkin party and would love it if you'd attend.

TAG: Elsa_007_f
A pumpkin party? How interesting. Should I bring anything? Or wear something special?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Just bring yourself and have fun!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe make a big ice sculpture shaped like a pumpkin?

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
Do you have an orange dress lying around?

TAG: Elsa_008_f
Well, I'd love to attend. Where will it be held?

TAG: Elsa_011_f
Just stop by the Fairy Godmother's House a little later.

TAG: Elsa_014_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}. The Fairy Godmother seems so kind. I've been hoping to get to know her better.

TAG: Elsa_009_f
Oh, I'd be happy to do that.

TAG: Elsa_012_f
Just kidding. The party will already be pumpkin-y enough without that.

TAG: Elsa_010_f
Oh, I don't think I do.

TAG: Elsa_004_f
Of course. I'll have to think about that.

TAG: Elsa_005_f
Well, do you like pumpkins?

TAG: Elsa_006_f
Of course, you're right. I'm still not always comfortable doing that after keeping myself locked away for so long. But I'd certainly like to try.
