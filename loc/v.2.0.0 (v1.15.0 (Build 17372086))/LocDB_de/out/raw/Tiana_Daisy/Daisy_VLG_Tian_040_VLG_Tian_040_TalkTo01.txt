Hey Daisy, I heard that you're dipping your toes into mask-making?

TAG: Daisy_000_f
That's right! After all, every big occasion calls for the perfect mask. And a parade is certainly a fabulous occasion... Tiana told me you might be stopping by.

TAG: Daisy_001_f
Now hold still a moment; I need to get some measurements...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So, uhâ

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've never been fitted for a mask before!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Tiana must have seemed excitedâ

TAG: Daisy_003_f
Hold still!

TAG: Daisy_012_f
What if you also wear something <Lore>quirky</Lore>?

TAG: Daisy_013_f
Can do!

TAG: Daisy_014_f
Perfect. Now, while I'm working on the mask, could you help Tiana some more?

TAG: Daisy_015_f
Of course. What does she need?

TAG: Daisy_016_f
She mentioned that she needed something to mark the start of the parade.

TAG: Daisy_017_f
*gasp* What about a balloon <ActivityItem>Parade Arch</ActivityItem> as a tribute to New Orleans?!

TAG: Daisy_018_f
No problem; I can work on that!

TAG: Daisy_004_f
...

TAG: Daisy_005_f
All right, done. I'll start working on your <ActivityItem>Parade Float Mask</ActivityItem> right away.

TAG: Daisy_006_f
So cool â can't wait to see how it will turn out!

TAG: Daisy_007_f
About that â I wouldn't be doing my duty as a designer if I didn't try to match this to your parade outfit.

TAG: Daisy_008_f
What will you be wearing?

TAG: Daisy_009_f
Hmm, I hadn't thought about that yet.

TAG: Daisy_010_f
From what I understand about New Orleans, it's full of exciting and fun people. Maybe I should dress up in something <Lore>bold</Lore>?

TAG: Daisy_011_f
Absolutely! Let's see... Well, Tiana told me that the parades can be quite playful.
