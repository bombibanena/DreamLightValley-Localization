Mickey, do you remember Monster Movie Night?

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Oh boy, do I!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Minnie used to love monster movies â especially the scary ones.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Right before the Forgetting, I even organized a screening of one just for her.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Uh-oh, now that I think about it... Did I forget to bring back the videotape? It was right around the time strange things started happenin' in the Valley.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Mr. McDuck says a lot of tapes didn't get returned. Just tell me where you left it, and I'll go look for it.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Thanks, pal! Let me think... Well, it was somewhere dark and deep on Dazzle Beach... I remember I had a screen set up there to create a scary atmosphere.

Oh, it's like a treasure hunt. I love it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you remember anything else?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's not a lot to go on.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Well then, happy hunting, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Maybe it was in some kinda cave on the Beach? Sorry, that's all I can remember.
