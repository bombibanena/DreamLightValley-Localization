What's this? <ActivityItem>A plate of BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Remy_001_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}! These look incredible. Did you make them?

TAG: Remy_002_f
Nope. Mirabel gave them to me.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Mirabel's back?! That's fantastic!

TAG: Remy_004_f
She really understands the power of a good meal to bring people together.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Though, it took me a while to get that when she said her mom's cooking could heal people... she meant ACTUALLY heal people.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Mirabel used to help me throw these amazing parties. She always had gifts crafted for all the guests. I hope we can do that again.

TAG: Remy_007_f
That's the thing. The Forgetting took Mirabel's memory of the <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem> recipe.

TAG: Player_000_f
We need you to taste one and see if you can figure out the ingredients...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We're really counting on you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think it's standard procedure for a chef.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Think you're up for the challenge?

TAG: Remy_008_f
Don't worry. Anything to help Mirabel!

TAG: Remy_016_f
And it's closely related to another basic ingredient in the recipe. I'm sure you can find it on the shelves of my restaurant.

TAG: Remy_017_f
So, I need <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Eggs</ActivityItem> and a mystery fourth Ingredient...

TAG: Remy_009_f
Okay, let me taste 'em.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Hmmm, a little stale but still good. As for the Ingredients, fritters almost always use the same base.

TAG: Remy_011_f
<ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem> for the flour, <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Eggs.</ActivityItem>

TAG: Remy_012_f
Anything else?

TAG: Remy_013_f
Oh, there's definitely a fourth Ingredient. But I'm gonna challenge you to find it.

TAG: Remy_014_f
You're a gifted sous-chef, but you've gotta train your palate to stay sharp. I'll give you a clue...

TAG: Remy_015_f
It's something salty. But it's not meat or fish or a vegetable.

TAG: Remy_018_f
A taste test? Sure. I can do that.

TAG: Remy_019_f
A culinary challenge? Of course!
