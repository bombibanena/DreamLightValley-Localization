{PlayerName}... I need to speak to you about a... a SCOURGE that's facing this Village!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Why it's nearly gotten as bad as the Forgetting.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
I'm talking about bad manners! Vanellope was quite rude to me earlier.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Vanellope is just trying to express herself.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Come on. I thought it was pretty funny.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
*sigh* I'll make sure she leaves you alone.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Express herself? Express herself?!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Kindly tell her that next time she would like to "express herself" in such a manner...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
...she ought to do it in a direction that is not towards my face!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Ugh, this is hopeless. I fear the entire Valley will soon lapse into utter rudeness.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
It almost makes one miss the Forgetting. At least that gave me some peace and quiet to read my books, even if I couldn't remember what I read.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Thank you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
You're the one thing standing between this Valley and a complete lapse into incivility!
