Oh, {PlayerName}! Pumbaa was just telling me you're helping him put on a pottery class?

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
That's so exciting!

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
Yeah! I was hoping you could tell me what we might need to get started...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I've never hosted a pottery class before!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't know what supplies we need.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're VERY artsy. HELP ME!

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
Neither have I... unless you count when I tried to teach Pascal to make itty-bitty teacups. But I have an idea...

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
You'll definitely need some <ActivityItem>Pottery Wheels</ActivityItem>, clay, and some flowers to make beautiful glazes.

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Sounds simple enough! I'll <Lore>craft some Pottery Wheels</Lore> and <Lore>collect the supplies we need</Lore>!

TAG: Rapunzel_008_f
And I'll go find Pumbaa. We can talk about throwing on the wheel versus handbuilding.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
Oh, I can help with that!

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
I'm sure you're artistic too, {PlayerName}, in your way. Everyone is. But don't worry; I know exactly what you'll need.
