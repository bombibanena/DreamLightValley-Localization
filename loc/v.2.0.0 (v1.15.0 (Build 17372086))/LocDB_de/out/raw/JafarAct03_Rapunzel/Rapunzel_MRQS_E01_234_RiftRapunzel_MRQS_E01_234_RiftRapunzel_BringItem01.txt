Oh, it's so beautiful!

TAG: Rapunzel_001_f
But there's something missing...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We could add some sparkles?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's not floating?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I give up. What?

TAG: Rapunzel_002_f
That would be pretty, but it's not exactly what I meant.

TAG: Rapunzel_003_f
When I saw those lights in the sky from my tower, it wasn't just the lights that were magical.

TAG: Rapunzel_004_f
It was also the wish I made and held onto.

TAG: Rapunzel_005_f
That makes sense. So why don't we <Lore>talk to some other Villagers</Lore> to discover what their wishes are?

TAG: Rapunzel_006_f
Then we can write their wishes on the lantern before we throw it in the rift! That's perfect, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Rapunzel_007_f
Well, no, not yet. But that's not what I meant.
