Eternity Isle...

It sure is an impressive place for a restaurant. I can already feel the culinary inspiration in my whiskers.

TAG: Remy_010_f
As for the building, though...

TAG: Remy_001_f
Well, it looks like we've got our work cut out for us... But hey, it's no bigger than other jobs we've tackled.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I agree.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You have a plan, don't you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's a depressing sight...

TAG: Remy_002_f
I thought you would.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Okay, I'll do some inventory and cleaning while you fetch supplies for the pantry. I definitely want some local ingredients.

TAG: Remy_008_f
What do you have in mind?

TAG: Remy_006_f
Hmm... To start, I'll need some <ActivityItem>Fish</ActivityItem> from Ancient's Landing, <ActivityItem>Cumin</ActivityItem> to spice up the meals, and...

TAG: Remy_007_f
...some <ActivityItem>Strawberries</ActivityItem> would be perfect. I've got an amazing strawberry cake idea!

TAG: Remy_003_f
As a matter of fact, I do.

Don't let the current state of the building bring you down. Sometimes you have to see what could be, not what is.
