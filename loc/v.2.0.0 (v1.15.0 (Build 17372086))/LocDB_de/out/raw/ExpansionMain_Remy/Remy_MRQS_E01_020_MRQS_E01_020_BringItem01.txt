{PlayerName}? What's this?

Ancient's Landing Fine Dining...

TAG: Remy_001_f
It's a menu. I found it beside a boarded-up restaurant on Eternity Isle.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Remy... did you used to have ANOTHER restaurant there?

TAG: Remy_010_f
Wait... It's all starting to come back to me...

TAG: Remy_011_f
I DID have another Chez Remy location on Eternity Isle!

TAG: Remy_012_f
It never got a chance to take off. I was just getting started when the Forgetting hit.

TAG: Remy_013_f
But hey... I think I'm ready to give it another try and open Chez Remy, Eternity Isle edition!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's an amazing idea!

You're always looking for a new challenge, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Isn't two restaurants a lot for just one of you?

TAG: Remy_005_f
I'm glad you think so.

TAG: Remy_008_f
C'mon; let's go check out Chez Remy on Eternity Isle.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Always. You never know where the inspiration for a new dish can come from.

Trust me, {PlayerName}; I'm very good at multitasking.
