Gawrsh, it's somebody new!

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Say... you're not the scary kind of stranger, are ya? You're just a friend I haven't met yet, right?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course I'm a friend!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I guess I can be a little scary.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm here to help. Are you okay?

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Phew! That's reassurin'. It's been a real long time since I've seen anybody else.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}! Here, let me see...

TAG: Goofy_015_f
Aw, it was just jammed up with seaweed. But it's all fixed now!

TAG: Goofy_000_f
Tell ya what, now that I have my Lucky Fishing Rod back, I'll give ya this one I found after the Forgetting so we can fish together.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
I think it belonged to our old Ruler... Hey, look! It seems to like you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Because I'm so magical!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Because I'm great at fishing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
That's weird. I'm not special.

TAG: Goofy_009_f
I've been waitin' for somebody to come along ever since the sky got dark and the Night Thorns crept in.

TAG: Goofy_021_f
But now you're here!

TAG: Goofy_011_f
We're gonna be good pals; I just know it. Uh, if that ain't too forward, a-hyuck!

TAG: Goofy_012_f
Gee, there's so much I wanna show ya...

TAG: Goofy_013_f
There's my Stall... we'll have to clean it up, though. And we can go fishin'... 'course I have to find my lucky Fishing Rod...

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Slow down, Goofy... I think I already found your Fishing Rod!

TAG: Goofy_014_f
Only one problem... It seems to be broken.

TAG: Goofy_016_f
That must be it! You do seem pretty magical.

TAG: Goofy_024_f
Well, here you go. It's all yours.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
And here's a groovy hat so you can look like a real angler!

TAG: Goofy_025_f
Whaddaya think of the hat? Pretty spiffy, huh?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's so stylish!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's nice.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's a bit... goofy.

TAG: Goofy_026_f
It sure is. Say, maybe I could start my own line of "Goofwear"...

TAG: Goofy_027_f
I could give Uncle Scrooge some competition. A-hyuck!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
All righty, let me show ya how to use your new Fishing Rod.

TAG: Goofy_028_f
Aw shucks, glad ya like it!

TAG: Goofy_029_f
A-hyuk! That's what's so great about it!

TAG: Goofy_017_f
Oh boy! I've been waitin' for a fishing buddy!

TAG: Goofy_023_f
Gawrsh, you seem pretty special to me.

TAG: Goofy_018_f
Aw, you sure don't seem scary to me compared to the Valley since the sky went dark...

TAG: Goofy_019_f
...and the Night Thorns crept in. It's felt more like a nightmare than a dream.

TAG: Goofy_020_f
See, I was alone here for... well, longer than I can remember.

TAG: Goofy_022_f
Sure I am. But it got a little scary when the sky went dark and a bunch of my friends left.
