Gawrsh, we never had Night Thorns before the Forgetting. Why do you think they showed up?

They're just weeds.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think they're attracted to negative emotions.

They're probably a metaphor.

You think? Well, at least we can get rid of 'em like weeds! Cut 'em down, dig 'em up, and make the Valley safe for nicer plants.

Hmm... that's an interesting idea. I know I'm unhappy when Thorns are around.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
But am I unhappy 'cause of the Thorns? Or are there Thorns 'cause I'm unhappy? Gawrsh, that's a pickle of a question.

A metaphor? You don't say. And all along I thought they were more like a simile.
