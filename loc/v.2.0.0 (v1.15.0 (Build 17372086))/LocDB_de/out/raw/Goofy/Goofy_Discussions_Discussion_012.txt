{PlayerName}, have I got somethin' to tell you! I caught a real funny fish the other day.

Never seen anything like it before. It was all big and puffed up.

What was it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds cool!

Bit of a fishy story...

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Well, I showed it to Merlin, and he said it's called a <ActivityItem>Fugu</ActivityItem> fish.

I guess it only swims up near the surface on Dazzle Beach when it's raining.

I tossed it back, but maybe you could try fishing for it next time it rains.
