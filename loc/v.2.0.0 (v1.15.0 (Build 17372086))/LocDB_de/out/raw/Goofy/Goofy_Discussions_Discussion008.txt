It's real inspiring to run a Stall in the same town as Donald's Uncle Scrooge. He's a savvy customer, and an even savvier businessman!

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Yeah, he's awesome!

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
I don't like how miserly he is.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I don't know him very well.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Yep, I hope someday I'm as good at business as he is. He's taught me a lot about how to run a Stall.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
He's even got a motto. Let me see if I can remember it. He says you gotta be smarter than the...

...dummies.

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
...smarties.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
...robots.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Nah. I don't think that's it.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
And you gotta be tougher than the...

...toughies.

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
...hedgehogs.

TAG: Player_000_choice_011_f
...softies.

TAG: Goofy_007_f
And you gotta make your money...

...circular.

...square.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
That's it! That's what Uncle Scrooge always says. Nice remembering, pal!

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Gawrsh, I think he's just real proud of all the hard work he's done. And he's taught me a lot about how to run a Stall.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Then you can take my word for it! Scrooge has taught me a lot about how to run a Stall.
