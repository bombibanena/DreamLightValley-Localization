Gawrsh, it's somebody new!

TAG: Goofy_000_f
Say... you're not the scary kind of stranger, are ya? You're just a friend I haven't met yet, right?

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Of course I'm a friend!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
I guess I can be a little scary.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
I'm here to help. Are you okay?

TAG: Goofy_013_f
Phew! That's reassurin'. It's been a real long time since I've seen anybody else.

TAG: Goofy_016_f
I've been waitin' for somebody to come along ever since the sky got dark and the Night Thorns crept in.

TAG: Goofy_019_f
But now you're here!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
We're gonna be good pals; I just know it. Uh, if that ain't too forward, a-hyuck!

TAG: Goofy_015_f
Gee, there's so much I wanna show ya...

TAG: Goofy_002_f
There's my Stall... we'll have to clean it up, though. And we can go fishin'... 'course I have to find my lucky Fishing Rod...

TAG: Player_002_f
Slow down, Goofy. We can do it all. Let's start with...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Finding your lucky Fishing Rod.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Going to your Stall.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Oh boy! I was hopin' you'd say that! I've been lookin' for it forever. C'mon, it must be near one of the ponds.

TAG: Goofy_022_f
Great! I'm real excited to show you around.

TAG: Goofy_014_f
Aw, you sure don't seem scary to me compared to the Valley since the sky went dark...

TAG: Goofy_018_f
...and the Night Thorns crept in. It's felt more like a nightmare than a dream.

TAG: Goofy_023_f
See, I was alone here for... well, longer than I can remember.

TAG: Goofy_020_f
Sure I am. But it got a little scary when the sky went dark and a bunch of my friends left.
