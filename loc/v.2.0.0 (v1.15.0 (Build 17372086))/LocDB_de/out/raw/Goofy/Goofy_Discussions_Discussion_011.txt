Gawrsh, {PlayerName}, it seems like whenever I go fishing lately, all I catch is <ActivityItem>Seaweed</ActivityItem>.

UGH, same.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Where are you fishing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Try to aim for the ripples!

TAG: Goofy_002_f
I've been castin' my line out at the ripples in the Meadow pond, but my luck's been rotten.

Course, now that I think of it, <ActivityItem>Seaweed</ActivityItem> isn't so bad. You can make lots of nifty stuff out of it.

Ya know what? I'm gonna go catch more <ActivityItem>Seaweed</ActivityItem> right now!
