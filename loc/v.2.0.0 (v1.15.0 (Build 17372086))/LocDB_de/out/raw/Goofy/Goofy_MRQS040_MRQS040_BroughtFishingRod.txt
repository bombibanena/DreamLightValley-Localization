I think I found your lucky Fishing Rod, Goofy!

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Only one problem... It seems to be busted. The reel won't turn.

TAG: Goofy_000_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}! Here, let me see...

TAG: Goofy_007_f
Aw, it was just jammed up with seaweed. But it's all fixed now!

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Tell ya what, now that I have my Lucky Fishing Rod back, I'll give ya this one I found after the Forgetting so we can fish together.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
I think it belonged to our old Ruler... Hey, look! It seems to like you!

TAG: Player_000_f
Hmm... It's reacting to me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Because I'm so magical!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Because I'm great at fishing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's weird. I'm not special.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
That must be it! You do seem pretty magical.

TAG: Goofy_011_f
Well, here you go. It's all yours.

TAG: Goofy_012_f
Whaddaya think of the hat? Pretty spiffy, huh?

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Oh boy! I've been waitin' for a fishing buddy!

TAG: Goofy_010_f
Gawrsh, you seem pretty special to me.

TAG: Goofy_006_f
And here's a groovy hat so you can look like a real angler!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's so stylish!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's nice!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's a bit... goofy.

TAG: Goofy_013_f
It sure is. Say, maybe I could start my own line of "Goofwear"...

TAG: Goofy_014_f
I could give Uncle Scrooge some competition. A-hyuck!

TAG: Goofy_002_f
All righty, let me show ya how to use your new Fishing Rod.

TAG: Goofy_015_f
Aw shucks, glad ya like it!

TAG: Goofy_016_f
A-hyuk! That's what's so great about it!
