Say, whatcha got there, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Goofy_002_f
It's a sock. I was thinking it might be yours.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
You're right! It is one of my socks.

TAG: Goofy_004_f
I've been looking for 'em everywhere. All my socks just up and disappeared the other day.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
All of them?

TAG: Goofy_006_f
Hmm... now that I think about it, it was only half of 'em. The left sock outta every pair is gone!

TAG: Player_000_f
Left sock? But socks don't... Never mind.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This is getting weirder and weirder.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe the sock bandit wants us all to be mismatched...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You didn't happen to see any space aliens, did you?

TAG: Goofy_007_f
I'll say. And that's not the only part that's weird.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
I saw some funny lights in the sky before it happened. I just thought it was some kinda shooting star, but now that I think about it...

TAG: Goofy_012_f
Donald's been goin' on about sock-stealing space aliens for a week now. Maybe he's right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I believed him all along.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm still not convinced.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
A terrifying prospect...

TAG: Goofy_013_f
Say, maybe the space aliens left behind some sorta clue when they messed up my House.

TAG: Goofy_014_f
Good idea. I'll <Lore>look around your House for clues</Lore>.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
Ya think so? I wonder why...

TAG: Goofy_011_f
Did you see anything else that was unusual?

TAG: Goofy_009_f
As a matter of fact...
