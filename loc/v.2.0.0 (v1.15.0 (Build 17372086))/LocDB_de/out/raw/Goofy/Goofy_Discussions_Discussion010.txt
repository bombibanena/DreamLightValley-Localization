Ya know, Uncle Scrooge is a swell neighbor. He's been giving me lots of advice.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
But sometimes I'm not sure what he's talkin' about. When he starts up about dividends and returns on investments, he kinda loses me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's nice of him to try to help!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You sure he's not trying to sabotage you?

TAG: Goofy_002_f
You bet it is!

TAG: Goofy_004_f
Sure, Uncle Scrooge likes money.

TAG: Goofy_005_f
Makin' money, and countin' money, and talkin' about money...

TAG: Goofy_006_f
But he's got a great big heart. Some folks don't see that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I agree. Scrooge is great.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think Scrooge is too greedy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I don't know Scrooge that well.

TAG: Goofy_008_f
He sure is!

TAG: Goofy_009_f
Well, like I said, he does love makin' money.

TAG: Goofy_011_f
But he's also real generous and always helps out his pals.

TAG: Goofy_010_f
Gawrsh, you should get to know him better!

TAG: Goofy_012_f
I bet you two will become friends in no time.

TAG: Goofy_003_f
Huh? You mean 'cause we both run stores? I don't think so.
