We've got some great pictures, but it feels like something's missing...

I know! We have plants, but we don't have any pictures of flowers!

It'd be a shame to miss all the pretty flowers in the Valley.

There are lots of <ActivityItem>Dandelions</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Falling Penstemons</ActivityItem> in the Plaza...

...and in the Meadow, there are <ActivityItem>Daisies</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Rising Penstemons</ActivityItem>!

Those Penstemons are in lots of places! You should be able to get great pictures of 'em.
