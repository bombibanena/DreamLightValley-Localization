Of course I want your help, Goofy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're the nicest fella around!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You know so much about fixing stuff.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You won't expect me to pay you like Scrooge McDuck...

TAG: Goofy_000_f
Well, that's mighty kind of you to say. You're real nice too. A-hyuck!

Ya know, I don't remember seein' any raft before... Guess the tide must've washed it in.

TAG: Goofy_013_f
Come to think of it, I heard somebody singing out at sea the other day.

TAG: Goofy_014_f
She had a real pretty voice. Gee, I hope she isn't shipwrecked out there.

TAG: Goofy_015_f
If we can fix this raft, then I can...

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
...go explore!

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
...rescue whoever's lost at sea!

TAG: Goofy_004_f
That sounds great! I think I know just what we'll need...

TAG: Goofy_010_f
Some <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Rope</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Goofy_012_f
You can find <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem> in the Forest of Valor and <ActivityItem>Clay</ActivityItem> in the Glade of Trust...

TAG: Goofy_008_f
It's kind of a lot, but nobody's as good at collectin' stuff as you!

TAG: Goofy_009_f
You'll have to do something about the Giant Night Thorns before you can fix the <ActivityItem>Wrecked Raft</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Goofy_001_f
Aw shucks. I do my best.

TAG: Goofy_002_f
Well, I think helpin' a friend's worth more than all the gold in the world.
