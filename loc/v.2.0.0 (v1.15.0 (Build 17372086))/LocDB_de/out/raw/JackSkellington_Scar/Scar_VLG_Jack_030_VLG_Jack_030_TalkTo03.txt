Back to bother me again, are we? Oh goody...

TAG: Scar_002_f
I'll be quick, Scar; I promise. Just have a few little questions for you.

TAG: Scar_003_f
How kind. You only wish to disrupt my day momentarily.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Go ahead; ask your questions. I'll endeavor to stay awake.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
OK, calm down. I'll be out of your fur soon enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So rude!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Hold on; I just thought of another dozen questions.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Not soon enough for me.

TAG: Scar_016_f
Great, I'll pass that along to Jack Skellington.

TAG: Scar_017_f
The walking skeleton is behind this?

TAG: Scar_018_f
Perhaps I'll put aside my plans to gnaw those old bones... for now.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Get to it, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scar_009_f
I wanted to know... what's your favorite holiday and why?

TAG: Scar_010_f
Holiday? Is that one of those human things you all are so fond of?

TAG: Scar_011_f
Well, humans like them, but no reason it has to be limited to us!

TAG: Scar_012_f
A holiday is sort of... a ritual that we do to mark something important.

TAG: Scar_013_f
Hmm, that does sound like it might have merit. I'm reminded of when the kingdom's subjects gather at Pride Rock to bear witness to the new lion prince or princess.

TAG: Scar_014_f
Yeah, kinda like that!

TAG: Scar_015_f
Having subjects gather and pay tribute to one's majesty is quite satisfying.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Yes, you are. Yet somehow I manage to keep my temper in check. How gracious of me.

TAG: Scar_007_f
Your attempts at wit are irritating at best.
