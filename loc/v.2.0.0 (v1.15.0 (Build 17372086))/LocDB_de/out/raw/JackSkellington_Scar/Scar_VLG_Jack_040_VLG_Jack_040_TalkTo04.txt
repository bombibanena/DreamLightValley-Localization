Finally, there you are, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scar_010_f
OK, OK, I'll check things out.

TAG: Scar_001_f
Once you are done, I suggest you remove yourself from my House quickly. I'm in no mood for guests.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Are you OK? I heard that Jack's Dreamlight Day gifts have been going... a little weird.

TAG: Scar_004_f
"Weird" would be how YOU'D describe it.

TAG: Scar_005_f
I, however, would say it's "an insult to dignity" and "exceedingly beyond the pale" among other choice descriptors.

TAG: Scar_006_f
What happened with your gift?

TAG: Scar_007_f
Nothing good.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Suffice to say, I am in need of redress.

TAG: Scar_009_f
Deal with it, {PlayerName}, before I am forced to take matters into my own claws.
