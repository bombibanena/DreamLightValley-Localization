Oh, {PlayerName}! Thank you! These are just what I needed to finish our mannequins AND our first design!

TAG: Minnie_002_f
And I'll be sure to thank Mirabel for the sewing machine. It'll be so much quicker than making things by hand.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What's next? I'm all in!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How can I help Dots & Daisies succeed?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Hand sewing?! That would take forever!

TAG: Minnie_011_f
Well, I'm excited that YOU'RE excited!

TAG: Minnie_005_f
Could I ask another favor? While I start sewing, would you ask Uncle Scrooge if he'd consider adding Dots & Daisies fashions to his store?

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Daisy planned to ask him, but I worry about how she may react if he says no. She's just so passionate about our new business.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course, I'll do it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is there a reason he'd refuse?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Who would win between Scrooge and Daisy?

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Thank you so much.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
He might not see us as professional designers yet. And I just know that would upset Daisy.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
All right, Minnie... I'll <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore> for you.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Oh, it wouldn't be a fight, {PlayerName}, just a disagreement. But there may be some hurt feelings.

TAG: Minnie_000_f
Goodness, Daisy wasn't joking when she said you were practically our third business partner.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
It does take patience and skill. But the machine will really make things fly.
