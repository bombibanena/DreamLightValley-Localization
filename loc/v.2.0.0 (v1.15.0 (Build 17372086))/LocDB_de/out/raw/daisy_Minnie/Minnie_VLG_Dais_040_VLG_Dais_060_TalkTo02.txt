Oh, {PlayerName}, it's always so good to see you. And I know why you're here!

Daisy told me about Vanellope's request, and I've gotten started on a wonderful new design.

TAG: Minnie_002_f
It's a dress that will make her feel "like a boss!" just like she asked.

TAG: Player_000_f
A dress...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...is a great idea!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...will be perfect publicity for your fashion line.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...might not be what Vanellope was looking for.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
Oh, I'm so glad you think so!

TAG: Minnie_004_f
I just need a few materials to make it.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
All right, Minnie. Give me a list and I'll bring you all the materials for Vanellope's dress.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
That would be wonderfully helpful! Thank you!

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Daisy said that exact same thing. You two really think alike.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Oh, I know she doesn't usually wear dresses, but part of the fun of fashion is trying new things and seeing how they make you feel.

TAG: Minnie_009_f
This dress could help Vanellope find a whole new way to express herself!

TAG: Minnie_010_f
If you say so... I guess it couldn't hurt to try?
