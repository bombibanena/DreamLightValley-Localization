Does raspberry jam pair well with camembert?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure does!

Not at all!

I don't know; does it?

Any memories of our missing chef trickling in?

Hmm... Well, I remember that she really liked jazz music...

TAG: Remy_015_f
Wait, do you smell that?

TAG: Remy_000_f
I do! Notes of pepper and paprika...

Whoa, something's happening â I think our mystery chef is coming back!

TAG: Remy_014_f
Thanks for the info, Remy. I'll keep making the rounds!
