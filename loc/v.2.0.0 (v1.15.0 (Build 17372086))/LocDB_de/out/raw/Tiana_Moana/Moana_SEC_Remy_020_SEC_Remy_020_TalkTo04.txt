Moana, I'm back with the completed dish. Turns out it's an <ActivityItem>Enchanted Shrimp ÃtouffÃ©e</ActivityItem>.

Amazing! That's as good as the seafood dishes my Gramma Tala used to make.

High praise!

I wish I'd gotten to try your grandmother's cooking...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Seafood is just too tasty...

TAG: Moana_009_f
Any chance the taste jogged any memories of who might have made the meal?

TAG: Moana_010_f
Hmm...

TAG: Moana_011_f
Well, I remember... she really liked the <Lore>Glade of Trust</Lore>. She said it reminded her of home.

TAG: Moana_012_f
Hold on â what's that?

TAG: Moana_001_f
Something is happening to the cookbook...

TAG: Moana_013_f
Thanks, Moana; I'll bring the meal around to the other Villagers from the memory. Maybe someone will remember something else.
