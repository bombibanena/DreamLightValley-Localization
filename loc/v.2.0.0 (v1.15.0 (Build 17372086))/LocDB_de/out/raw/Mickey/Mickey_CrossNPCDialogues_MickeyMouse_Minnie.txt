Hey, Minnie! Would you like to go dancing tonight?

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Oh, Mickey, I'd love to! But where will we go?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
I thought we could go up to the fountain in front of the Castle!

I've got an old phonograph and some old-timey dance records we could play. Maybe we could even dress up in those 1920s costumes we wore last Halloween.

Oh, that'll be so much fun! I can't wait, Mickey!
