Great! Now we need to water 'em before they dry out.

Minnie always says to pay attention to the leaves on a plant. They'll let you know when it's time to water.

I'm glad you found the Royal Watering Can.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
That'll be real helpful when you're gardening.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Give it a try, {PlayerName}!

I used to take care of some of the gardens in the Valley, like the one at your House... but then the Night Thorns took 'em over.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
I tried to protect the Royal Watering Can... but I lost it, just like the Shovel.

TAG: Player_000_f
You lost the Shovel AND the Watering Can?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's okay. It happens.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Really, Mickey...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Where can I find them?

TAG: Mickey_010_f
It must be the Forgetting. I don't remember losing stuff before that.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Hey, but now that you're here, my memories are starting to come back. I think the last time I saw it, it was near your House.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Let's go check over there!

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Gosh, if I could remember that, they wouldn't be lost. Heh-heh.
