Do you believe in magic, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I literally know a wizard, Mickey.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Me too! I've seen all sorts of magical things around here.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
You should see Merlin when he's packing for a trip. He can fit his whole house into just one suitcase!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Gosh, I didn't expect you to say that.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Well, if that's the case, what do you think it is that Merlin does?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Elaborate lighting tricks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Swamp gas.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I'm kidding... I do believe in magic.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
If that's true, those are some really impressive light tricks!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Huh? I didn't know swamp gas could do all that.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Heh. Guess that was sort of a silly question.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
I love watchin' him do magic.
