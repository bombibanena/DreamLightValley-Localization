And now I remember the rest of the riddle! It goes:

TAG: Mickey_006_f
"Turrets and towers you will behold. Within: a door for things new and old."

TAG: Mickey_007_f
"It needs no key you've ever known. To open this door, find matching stones."

TAG: Mickey_008_f
What kinda stones could it be talking about?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Hey, look! The door has holes shaped like gems. Maybe it wants gemstones?
