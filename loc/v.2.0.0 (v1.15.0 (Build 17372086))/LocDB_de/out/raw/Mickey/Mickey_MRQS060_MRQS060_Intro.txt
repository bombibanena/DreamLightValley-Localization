Gosh, {PlayerName}, there isn't much left of my garden...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's a mess!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's not so bad...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It needs a little love.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
It sure is.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Minnie definitely wouldn't be happy if she saw it like this. She loves gardens.

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Well, the sooner we make this recipe, the sooner we can make Dreamlight Valley a place she'll be proud of again!

TAG: Mickey_004_f
Okay... the recipe says to prepare the <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>. We need Fruit, like <ActivityItem>Apples</ActivityItem>. I bet you can find some of those around the Village.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Oh, and you know what would be great with a <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Mickey_012_f
Some <ActivityItem>Crackers</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
You want to make <ActivityItem>Crackers</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>?! That's so...

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
...cute! You're funny, Mickey.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
...dull. Not exactly high cuisine!

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
...simple. Should be easy to make!

TAG: Mickey_016_f
Oh gosh... Thanks!

TAG: Mickey_019_f
But, uh... to tell ya the truth, the real reason I wanna make <ActivityItem>Crackers</ActivityItem> is 'cause that's what Minnie used to make.

TAG: Mickey_020_f
Guess I just wish she were here to make 'em now.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Mickey... are you okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
So how do we make them?

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Me? Aw, I'm fine. I miss Minnie, but it sure helps that you're here now.

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Okay, Minnie's <ActivityItem>Crackers</ActivityItem> are super easy to bake. They only take some <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>. Here's the recipe...

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Yikes! I forgot. We'll have to start gardening before we can start cooking!

TAG: Mickey_015_f
To get some <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem>, we'll have to plant it.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
Here are some seeds we can use.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
It'll be great to replace all those ugly Night Thorns with some nice plants!

TAG: Mickey_017_f
Gosh, just because it's not fancy doesn't mean it's not good.

TAG: Mickey_018_f
Yep, and there's nothing wrong with simple.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Aw, thanks for being nice, but I know it's a mess.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Yeah, it just hasn't been the same since the Night Thorns showed up.
