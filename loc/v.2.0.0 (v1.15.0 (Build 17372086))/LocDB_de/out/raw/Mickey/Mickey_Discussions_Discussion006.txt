You know, as an actor, I've gotten to do all sorts of fun jobs.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
If you're curious about any of 'em, I'd be happy to tell you.

Steamboat operator.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorcerer's apprentice.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Musketeer.

TAG: Mickey_002_f
That was the first job anybody got to see me do! And Minnie, too!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
I had a great time whistling and driving that steamboat down the river.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Sounds fun!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Sounds boring.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Sounds muggy.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
It was! Especially since Minnie and I got to work together.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Nah. It was great! I got to be out in the fresh air and work with Minnie. I loved it!

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Well yeah, it was a steamboat! Ha-ha!

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Gosh, that one was a lot of work. Carrying all those water buckets was harder than it looked.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
But it got really fun after I made that big mistake...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What mistake?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Did it involve brooms?

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Well, I tried to do some magic. And it kinda got out of hand.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Yep, LOTS and LOTS of brooms. Ha-ha!

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Aw, that was a blast! Goofy, Donald and I got to battle with swords and race across the countryside. It was awesome!
