{PlayerName}! When you opened that chest, I remembered something new!

TAG: Mickey_001_f
I remembered a door... But I can't figure out where it is...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
And I remembered... part of a riddle? It goes:

TAG: Mickey_003_f
"Turrets and towers you will behold. Within: a door for things new and old."

TAG: Mickey_005_f
It sounds like there's a secret door somewhere! Could you help me find it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes! Let's go!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Can you repeat that riddle again?

TAG: Mickey_006_f
Hot dog! Secret door, here we come!
