Wow, {PlayerName}! You've sure got a green thumb!

TAG: Player_000_f
Thanks, Mickey! Gardening is so...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...relaxing!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...useful!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...stressful!

TAG: Mickey_008_f
I agree. There's nothing like working in my garden to help me feel peaceful. Especially when there aren't any Night Thorns to worry about.

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Well, now that you know how to garden, why don't you get some Ingredients ready for the <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Mickey_004_f
<ActivityItem>Apples</ActivityItem> grow all the time on the <ActivityItem>Apple Trees</ActivityItem> around the Village.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
If you already picked some, you might need to wait for more to grow. But don't worry; it shouldn't take too long.

TAG: Mickey_006_f
And make sure to keep some of each Ingredient so you'll always have something to make for your friends!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll always keep some handy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
They're too yummy to save up!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I think there's a trunk in my House where I can store them!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
That's great! I used to try to save raspberries so I could bake a pie for Minnie...

TAG: Mickey_013_f
...but I'd always end up eating 'em on my way home!

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Oh, Mickey...

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Okay, when you're ready with the Ingredients, we'll make the <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem> at your House.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Oh, and don't forget to pick up the wheat you planted!

TAG: Mickey_011_f
I understand that. I used to try to save raspberries to bake a pie for Minnie...

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Yeah, I used to have a big trunk where I could keep all my ingredients, too. I used to try to keep it filled with raspberries so I could bake pies for Minnie...

TAG: Mickey_009_f
Yeah! We can feed the whole Village with the food we grow in our gardens!

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Aw, don't worry, {PlayerName}. If you treat your garden with love and care, it'll all come out just fine.
