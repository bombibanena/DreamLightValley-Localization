Hiya, {PlayerName}! Do you need some help?

TAG: Mickey_002_f
I do. Donald thinks the Village is under invasion by sock-stealing space aliens.

TAG: Mickey_003_f
Ha-ha! Yeah, I've heard him talkin' about it.

TAG: Player_000_f
I've been investigating to try to...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...find the space aliens and stop them!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...prove there aren't any space aliens.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...figure out what's going on.

TAG: Mickey_005_f
Gosh, so you really think we've got space aliens stealin' socks around here?

TAG: Mickey_006_f
I know it. I'm on the trail of another clue.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
I found this <ActivityItem>Knitted Sock</ActivityItem>. Is it yours?

TAG: Mickey_010_f
I don't think so. It doesn't look like any of my other socks, so even if the Forgetting made me forget, I doubt it's one of mine.

TAG: Mickey_011_f
Say... I think I remember somebody making those, though.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
It was the Fairy Godmother!

TAG: Mickey_017_f
She's always doing whatever she can to make sure everybody in the Village is happy and taken care of... even making sure our feet are warm!

TAG: Mickey_014_f
I bet she conjured these to give to somebody special as a gift.

TAG: Mickey_013_f
I guess I'll have to figure out who that someone special was. Thanks, Mickey!

TAG: Mickey_012_f
It was somebody who used to take care of everybody in the Village... including making sure our feet stayed warm.

TAG: Mickey_016_f
If I try real hard, I can almost remember what she looked like... but not quite.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
So you don't think there are space aliens here? But who's stealing all the socks?

TAG: Mickey_008_f
That's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm on the trail of another clue.

TAG: Mickey_018_f
Oh boy! So you think there might really be sock-stealin' space aliens around here?

TAG: Mickey_019_f
We can't rule anything out. I'm on the trail of another clue.
