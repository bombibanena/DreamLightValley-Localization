Hey, Minnie! Can I get some advice about rekindling a romance?

TAG: Minnie_010_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Certainly! I'd love to help.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
What seems to be the trouble?

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Well, Jack and Sally have spent a lot of time apart and need something to connect them again.

TAG: Minnie_005_f
I'm trying to help them plan a fun date, but well... those two aren't your typical romantics.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Yes, I see what you mean. Let me think for a moment...

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Oh! I have an idea!

TAG: Minnie_008_f
Mickey and I always feel close when we share an experience. What if you make them a tasty treat to share?

TAG: Minnie_009_f
I have a lovely recipe for <Lore>Gingerbread Cookies</Lore> that you're welcome to use.

Daisy gave me similar advice. She suggested that I make something in a Halloween-themed shape.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
I think getting some more Halloween-themed foods and arranging a picnic should be perfect!

TAG: Minnie_013_f
Oh, they'll love it! And, you know, some <ActivityItem>Candy Apples</ActivityItem> would go wonderfully with that.

TAG: Minnie_016_f
Ooo! I have one last idea! If you really want to make the date special, you can have Sally and Jack <Lore>gather by the Holiday Tree Portal</Lore> that Jack first came through!

TAG: Minnie_014_f
Thanks, Minnie. I'm going to ask Daisy too, but this is excellent advice.

TAG: Minnie_015_f
I'm always happy to help!

TAG: Minnie_000_f
You know, some <ActivityItem>Candy Apples</ActivityItem> would also be a fun Halloween-y treat.
