Hey Minnie? What do you think of Sally's ideas?

TAG: Minnie_001_f
They're so wonderfully chilling! Even if we don't collaborate on a collection right NOW, I think we should work together on a Halloween project soon!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I love it!

Dots and daisies and spiders!

TAG: Minnie_003_f
I'm glad you agree.

I'll add it to my design bulletin board right now!

Me too! Oh, this makes me want to start pulling swatches for orange already!
