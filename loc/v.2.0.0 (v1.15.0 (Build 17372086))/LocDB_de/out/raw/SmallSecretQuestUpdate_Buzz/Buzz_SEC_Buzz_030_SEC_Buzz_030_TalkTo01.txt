I have some new intel, Space Ranger, and the situation is critical.

The remaining <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> have gone into Attic Mode.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
They've tucked themselves away in some of the most hidden parts of the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
We have to find them!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
If they're asleep, are you sure it wouldn't be rude to wake them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I wish I could go into Attic Mode. Sounds relaxing...

TAG: Buzz_003_f
I like your attitude, {PlayerName}. I'm sure you'll handle this with your usual professionalism.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
We need to search every dollhouse, shoebox, and trash receptacle we can find.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
You know the Valley better than I do, {PlayerName}. It's your settlement. So tell me...

TAG: Buzz_008_f
If you had to hide somewhere in this Village, where would you go? Once you know that, check there.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Not at all. I'm sure they're only hiding because they're scared.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Relaxing, maybe. But it gets lonely after a while. Toys are meant to be played with, not packed away.
