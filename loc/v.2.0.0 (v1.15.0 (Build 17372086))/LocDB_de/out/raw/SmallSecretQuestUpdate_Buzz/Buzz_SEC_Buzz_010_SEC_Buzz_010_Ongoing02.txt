We've got to do a survey of every sector of the Village if we're going to find those <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Buzz_002_f
There's no telling where they might have gone.

TAG: Buzz_003_f
Toys are highly skilled at hiding in the backs of closets, behind beds, and between couch cushions.

TAG: Buzz_004_f
Got it. I'll look everywhere in the Village.

TAG: Buzz_005_f
Oh, and one final thing.

TAG: Buzz_006_f
These <ActivityItem>Aliens</ActivityItem> can be a bit shy. They might not all come out of hiding at once.

TAG: Buzz_007_f
Keep an eye out for them while you complete your regular duties. I suspect they could pop up in multiple locations.

TAG: Buzz_008_f
Hmm... But there's one sector that's still closed off, isn't there?

TAG: Buzz_009_f
That's right! I think that place is called the Forgotten Lands...

TAG: Buzz_010_f
I can't imagine why any toy would want to go there. Being forgotten is a sad thing for a toy.

TAG: Buzz_011_f
But you'll need to check there too if you want to be sure you've located them all.
