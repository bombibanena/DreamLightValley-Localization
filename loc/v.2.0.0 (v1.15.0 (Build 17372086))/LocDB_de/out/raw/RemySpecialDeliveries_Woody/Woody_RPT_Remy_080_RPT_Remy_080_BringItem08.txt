Are you going to eat this?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are you about to play with your food?

TAG: Woody_002_f
No, no. This is all for playtime!

Stitch, Olaf, and Vanellope want to play pretend. So that's what we're gonna do.

These gingerbread houses will be the old west buildings. We'll plant that roasted asparagus around it to make some little fences.

And the salad's gonna be the green pasture where the cows graze.

Then, Stitch will be the giant monster who comes around and stomps it all to smithereens!

TAG: Woody_003_f
You guessed it.
