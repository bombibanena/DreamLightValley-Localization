Yes! This celebration is happening! Wait'll you see the activities I've planned.

TAG: Mushu_002_f
A Red Pouch Scavenger Hunt, a cooking challenge, and a special party game!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Red Pouch hunt?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A cook-off?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Special party game?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'm ready to do ALL this stuff!

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Yeah, where Mulan and I come from, it's a real important New Year's tradition to give Lucky Red Envelopes with money inside. It's a gesture of goodwill and a wish for wealth.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
So, I wanna take that special tradition and give it a Dreamlight Valley spin. I've hidden <ActivityItem>Red Pouches</ActivityItem> around the Mines.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
If you find 'em, you get to keep what's inside!

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Yep, I've got a recipe for <ActivityItem>Sesame Balls</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Mushu_008_f
It's a contest, plus a treat! Pretty cool, huh?

TAG: Mushu_004_f
You got it! I based it on a spring festival tradition from back home.

TAG: Mushu_009_f
We fill these big containers with seeds and try to break 'em by hitting 'em with sticks. The seeds come out, and it means good weather for the growing season!

TAG: Mushu_013_f
My game's like that, except the container's filled with candy.

TAG: Mushu_000_f
Mushu... Something filled with candy you try to break during a party? That kind of sounds like a piÃ±ata.

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Huh. Never heard of it. But, sure, we can call it that. Ooh, and it'll be easier to fit on the sign than "Special Party Game"!

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Anyway, during the spring festivals, our "piÃ±atas" are usually shaped like farm animals. But I shaped mine like fireworks.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
You know, to make the <Lore>candy</Lore> look all bright and sparkly when it falls out!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Heh-heh. All right, enjoy yourself, {PlayerName}! I'm gonna go mingle.
