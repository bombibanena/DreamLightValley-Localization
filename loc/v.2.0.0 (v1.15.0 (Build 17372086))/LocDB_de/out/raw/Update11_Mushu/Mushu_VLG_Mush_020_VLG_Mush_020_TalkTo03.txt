Okay, {PlayerName}, now that you've looked at YOUR <ActivityItem>Ink Blot Test</ActivityItem>, tell me...

TAG: Mushu_003_f
What did the ink on the paper look like to you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The Peaceful Meadow?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A universe of total chaos.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It looks like blotches of ink on paper.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
Hmm... Flowery, peaceful...

TAG: Mushu_007_f
You're pretty content, huh?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Well, I'm an optimist!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The Valley is my happy place.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I just picked a random option.

TAG: Mushu_009_f
You've got reason to be! You're practically a ray of sunshine around here.

TAG: Mushu_019_f
Now that you've done your Ink Blot Test, it's time for the Beast to take his.

TAG: Mushu_020_f
Will you set it up near his House? Castle? Castle-House?

TAG: Mushu_021_f
You know what I mean.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
That's great. It's one of my happy places too!

TAG: Mushu_010_f
That says "I'm uncertain" to me. And there's no problem with being uncertain.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Hmm... that tells me you feel kinda uncertain about your direction in life.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Aren't we all?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Kinda? I'm VERY uncertain!

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
That's not me at all!

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Not ME, but it seems to be pretty common with you mortal types.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Don't worry. SEEING the chaos means it probably won't take you by surprise.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Hey, that's not a bad thing. Trust me.

TAG: Mushu_013_f
Oh, so you're someone who CONTROLS the chaos. I see you!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Oh, I know EXACTLY what that means!

TAG: Mushu_015_f
You're being literal... Which is hilarious... Or defensive. Maybe both?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'm very funny!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Yeah... I'm not ready to open up.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Maybe a bit of both, TBH.

TAG: Mushu_017_f
That IS true. You make me laugh every day. Sometimes with you... sometimes at you. Same thing.

TAG: Mushu_016_f
Hey, that's okay. We can just move along!

TAG: Mushu_018_f
I hear you, and that's okay. Everyone opens up in their own time.
