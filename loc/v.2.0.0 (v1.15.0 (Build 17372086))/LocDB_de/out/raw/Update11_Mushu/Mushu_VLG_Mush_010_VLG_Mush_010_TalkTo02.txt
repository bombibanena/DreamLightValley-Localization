Oh my. That is... that is... FANTASTIC!

Looking at this guy, there's no way I can forget destiny's call to be a Guardian! Thanks, {PlayerName}!

What's next?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Feels like we're missing something...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Are we done?

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Oh! Our lucky bugs just made a GREAT suggestion. We gotta really make this statue shine!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
You know, decorate it, give it a little pizzazz!

TAG: Mushu_007_f
I'm thinking lots of red!

TAG: Mushu_008_f
Let's get some <ActivityItem>Red Flowers</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Garnets</ActivityItem>... Plus a few other <Lore>precious gems</Lore> just for good measure.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Now, while you do that, I'm gonna look into our options for lighting!

TAG: Mushu_005_f
Hmm, you're right... but what?

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Oh yeah. We are SO done. Waitâ

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Huh? What's that? Oh!

TAG: Mushu_009_f
Our lucky bugs, Crawly, Skittery, and Flutter, say they think the statue needs a little something extra.
