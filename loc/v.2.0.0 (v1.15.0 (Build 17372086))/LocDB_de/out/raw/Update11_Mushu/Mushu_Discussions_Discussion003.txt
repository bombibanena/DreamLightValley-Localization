You got questions about my job? Ask away! I am an expert Guardian, you know.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What do you do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You only guard one family?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are there other Guardians?

TAG: Mushu_001_f
That's easy. I protect the Fa family from danger!

TAG: Mushu_002_f
Guide 'em in big life choices, protect 'em from harm...

TAG: Mushu_003_f
You know, Guardian stuff.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Yep. The Fa family. Mulan's family. Families have their own Guardians.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
Technically, I serve the ancestors. They tell me what to do, and I go and do it.

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Yeah. In the Fa family, we got an ox, a monkey, and a few others.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
The monkey and me are pretty good friends. She's not all "I-am-a-Guardian-I-must-be-serious-at-all-times" like the others.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
Uh, don't ask about the Great Stone Dragon, though. He's on a leave of absence.
