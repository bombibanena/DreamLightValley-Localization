You're too kind.

I did my best.

These old things... Pff.

Hey, you deserve it. You did a very impressive job.

And I know they'll look even more ferocious once they've been fired!

You just need to put the <ActivityItem>Unfired Dragon Statues</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Firewood</ActivityItem> in the kiln, then I'll light it up.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Well, your best is great! They look just like me!

TAG: Mushu_005_f
I don't know if you're bragging or just being humble.

But I know they'll look even more ferocious and impressive once they're fired.
