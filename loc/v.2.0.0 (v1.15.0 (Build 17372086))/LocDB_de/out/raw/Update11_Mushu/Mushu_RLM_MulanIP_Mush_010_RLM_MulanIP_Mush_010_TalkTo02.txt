Excellent work, {PlayerName}... I mean, recruit. The camp looks good as new.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Now, we can't start your real training until you're properly dressed.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
There should be a uniform for you around here somewhere...

TAG: Mushu_005_f
Well, parts of it, anyway.

TAG: Mushu_000_f
What do you mean "parts"?

TAG: Mushu_001_f
Oh, I think the kids... I mean the recruits... were in a hurry to get home and forgot to turn in their <ActivityItem>Uniforms</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Don't worry: Everything's clean. You just <Lore>gotta look around for the different pieces</Lore>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh! Like a treasure hunt! I love it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds simple enough.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is there anything in this camp that isn't a mess?

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Sure. Yeah. That's it. Have fun!

TAG: Mushu_010_f
You're gonna have to <Lore>look ALL over the camp and outside it too</Lore>.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Make sure you find <ActivityItem>Shoes</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Socks</ActivityItem>, a pair of <ActivityItem>Pants</ActivityItem>, and a <ActivityItem>Shirt</ActivityItem>. Once you find everything, bring 'em back to me.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
Yeah, I don't know about that.

TAG: Mushu_009_f
Pfft. You sound like some ancestors I know, always criticizing everybody's work.

TAG: Mushu_014_f
Now, if you're done with the review, you gotta <Lore>look ALL over the camp and outside it too</Lore>.
