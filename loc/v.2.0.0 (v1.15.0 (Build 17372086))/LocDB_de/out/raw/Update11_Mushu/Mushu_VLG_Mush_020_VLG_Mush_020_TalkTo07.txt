Mushu, I'm back!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think your plan is ACTUALLY working.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I hope that furniture wasn't important...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Smashing stuff was so fun.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
"Actually"? Please. Of COURSE it's working. I'm just that good.

TAG: Mushu_006_f
The Beast says he's ready for the next part of the program.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
On to the FINALE â Immersion! I've been waiting for this one.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
While you were wrecking that furniture with the Beast, I was making the rounds for supplies.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Could you go talk to <Lore>Daisy and Stitch</Lore> and see if they've got the things I asked 'em for?

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Oh, and we're gonna need some of His Highness's royal attire. You'll probably have to <Lore>head back to the Beast's homeland to find some of that</Lore>.

TAG: Mushu_013_f
Okay...? I'm on it.

TAG: Mushu_000_f
Once you've got everything, <Lore>go to a Crafting Station to put our little project together</Lore> then <Lore>place it outside the Beast's House.</Lore>

TAG: Mushu_009_f
I'm going to see if there's anything we can recycle from the broken furniture.

TAG: Mushu_002_f
Nah, it's just some stuff I found.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
I thought Mulan could use it for martial arts practice.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Aw, I'm glad you're having a good time.
