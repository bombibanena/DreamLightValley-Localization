I've noticed there's a Villager who might need the kinda help I specialize in.

TAG: Mushu_001_f
I won't name any names...

TAG: Mushu_002_f
But he's got some self-image issues. I'm trying to figure out how to encourage him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe he could train with Mulan.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How about a makeover?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is this guy tall, furry, and friends with Belle?

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Uh, I don't think a lack of exercise is the issue here.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
But, hey, it couldn't hurt!

TAG: Mushu_005_f
Ooh. Interesting idea. You know I do think he'd look good in blue?

TAG: Mushu_006_f
I'll see if he wants to go shopping.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Yeah. I think you've picked up what I'm putting down.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Maybe he could train with Mulan.

How about a makeover?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
He could probably use a friend.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
You know, you're right! Well, don't you worry. Mushu is on the job!
