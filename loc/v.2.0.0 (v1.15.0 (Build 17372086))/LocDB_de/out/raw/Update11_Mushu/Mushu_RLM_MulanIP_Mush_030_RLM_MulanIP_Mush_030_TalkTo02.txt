We're in good shape, Mushu! Everything's under control.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
PHEW! You are a life saver! Or should I say, a dragon statue SAVIOR? HA!

TAG: Mushu_000_f
Planting trees? Sandbags? GREAT strategy.

That landslide really shook things up, though. And like I always say, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!"

TAG: Mushu_001_f
(I don't really say that, but it sounded good, right?) Anyway... There's a lot MORE prevention we can do.

You want to stop future landslides?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I like to say, "Hakuna Matata."

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What does that even mean?

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Yeah! We need to protect this road. Roads are important, you know. The veins of China!

TAG: Mushu_009_f
So I'm thinking: What if we build a mini Great Wall to protect the road from future landslides?

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Well... I did pick up a lot of logs while we cleaned up the road. How about <Lore>a fence</Lore>?

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Works for me! You <Lore>make the fence</Lore>, and I'll prep the area.

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Hakuna ma-what-uh? You know what? No worries. I don't need to know. It's time to focus!

TAG: Mushu_008_f
It means it's better to be ready for something than it is to have to fix it later. You get what I'm saying?
