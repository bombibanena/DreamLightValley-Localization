Hey now, these are some of the luckiest bugs I've ever seen!

TAG: Mushu_002_f
I'll take good care of 'em while we build the statue, and let 'em go once we're finished.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's next, Mushu?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm feeling luckier already!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Aw, like they're little pets!

TAG: Mushu_004_f
We gotta <Lore>scout the Valley for the PERFECT place to put our statue.</Lore>

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Let's both go look. And while you're at it, take this <ActivityItem>Incense Lantern</ActivityItem>. Carry it with you to spread good vibes and help you focus on finding the perfect spot.

TAG: Mushu_000_f
It'll also make the Valley smell extra good!

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Oh, but I'd <Lore>avoid doing that magic, sparkly gliding thing you do</Lore>. The breeze blows out the lantern, so you gotta do this one on foot.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Me too, and we're gonna need it because now the real work begins.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
Yeah, maybe I'll even name 'em... Crawly, Skittery and...

TAG: Mushu_006_f
...Flutter! Aw, they're so cute. Hey, you all! ... What's that...? They say they can't wait to start.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Listen to the bugs, {PlayerName}! Let's get our plan for the statue going!
