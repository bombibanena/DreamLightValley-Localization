Hey, {PlayerName}. I need a little help here. It's about the Forgetting. You got a minute?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What's on your mind, Mushu?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Let's talk later.

TAG: Mushu_017_f
Well, I'm real happy to be here in the Valley. And everything's starting to come back to me.

TAG: Mushu_018_f
Like, I remembered that before the Forgetting, I wasn't JUST Mulan's Guardian... I was Guardian for the whole Valley.

TAG: Mushu_019_f
Problem is, now that I've remembered, I got this worry I can't shake...

TAG: Mushu_020_f
What happens if I forget everything again?!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Your friends will remind you!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Dreamlight Valley is safe with me now.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Would a song help you make sure you don't forget?

TAG: Mushu_022_f
Unless THEY forget again too!

TAG: Mushu_024_f
Hmm... Maybe we can put up a display? Something that will always remind you who you are.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
Like a big shield, because you're a protector?

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Like a big, everlasting torch?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Like a HUGE statue of YOU?

TAG: Mushu_026_f
I might not get the message with that. See, there was this time I used a shield as a snow sledâ But, that's not the point.

TAG: Mushu_028_f
That does give me an idea, though. What if we made something like the <Lore>Great Stone Dragon</Lore> statue from the Fa family's garden?!

TAG: Mushu_029_f
It's a HUGE Guardian statue that always inspired me to be a Guardian. Here, it could remind me that I AM a Guardian. Like a giant symbol of my sworn duty!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That's surprisingly sweet.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
It won't bruise your ego?

TAG: Mushu_011_f
Aw, I knew I could count on you!

TAG: Mushu_013_f
First, we gotta get rid of any bad luck that might mess up the project.

TAG: Mushu_015_f
Since my pal Cri-Kee isn't here, could you <Lore>go back to our training camp</Lore> and catch a few <ActivityItem>Lucky Bugs</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Mushu_016_f
While you do that, I'm gonna draw up some plans.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Well, you know, even a fearsome dragon can have a soft side. Now...

TAG: Mushu_012_f
Please! I'm the Guardian of an ENTIRE VALLEY! I'm good. Now...

TAG: Mushu_025_f
A hot idea! But probably a little too vague.

TAG: Mushu_027_f
Heh-heh. Now, I do like the sound of that, but I'm not sure it'll help me remember my duty to the Valley. Of course it WOULD make me say, "Whoa! What a handsome statue!"

TAG: Mushu_021_f
I know, I know. And you're great, {PlayerName}. But I gotta make sure I can always do my part.

TAG: Mushu_023_f
Ha! I like the way you think, but singing isn't really my thing.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Okay. All right. No problem. I'll be around!
