So that was... Huh... What do YOU think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think the Beast REALLY needs our help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think we need to hug the Beast every day.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm kinda speechless.

TAG: Mushu_003_f
And fast! I knew there was something going on with him.

TAG: Mushu_005_f
We gotta boost the Beast's confidence, and a pep talk isn't gonna do it.

TAG: Mushu_006_f
You know, sometimes when Mulan isn't feeling her best, she does some training.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Says it lifts her mood and makes her feel all powerful and calm.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What do you have in mind?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I can't see the Beast doing Tai Chi...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm thinking step aerobics.

TAG: Mushu_011_f
What if we put together an area where the two of you can go and just break stuff?

TAG: Mushu_013_f
The only time he uses his strength now is when he's angry and outta control, right?

TAG: Mushu_012_f
But if the Beast uses his strength in a controlled way and lets off some steam...

TAG: Mushu_014_f
... maybe he won't be so mad at himself.

TAG: Mushu_015_f
And that's step two in the M.U.S.H.U. program. Action â taking physical action to help ourselves feel better!

TAG: Mushu_016_f
Let's <Lore>set up a Wrecking Area</Lore> for you and the Beast.

TAG: Mushu_000_f
And we can use this <ActivityItem>Old Furniture</ActivityItem> I found. It's already a little broken, so it'll be perfect for smashing up.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Oh, that would be so good for him! But I'm thinking we need to start messier.

TAG: Mushu_009_f
I have no idea what that is, but I do have ANOTHER idea.

TAG: Mushu_002_f
Okay... But hugs won't mean anything if he doesn't think he DESERVES 'em, right?

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Don't worry. I can talk enough for the both of us.
