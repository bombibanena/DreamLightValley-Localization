Oh yeah! I can tell by your smiling face! The Beast said yes!

TAG: Mushu_002_f
There's one catch... I have to do the program with him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It was the only way he would agree.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm nervous, but helping the Beast is worth it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm definitely going to win!

TAG: Mushu_005_f
I send you to convince the Beast and you come back offering a 2-for-1? This is my lucky day!

TAG: Mushu_007_f
Where do we start?

TAG: Mushu_008_f
Oh, I do love that go-get-'em attitude! The first phase of the program is "Analysis."

TAG: Mushu_003_f
To help the Beast, I need to know what's on his mind. And to do that, we're gonna use an <ActivityItem>Ink Blot Test</ActivityItem>. I found a whole book about making and analyzing 'em in Merlin's library. So I'm pretty much an expert now.

TAG: Mushu_009_f
We're gonna need art supplies. Could you <Lore>talk to Mulan to get some paper</Lore> and <Lore>ask Belle for some ink</Lore>?

TAG: Mushu_010_f
We need the good stuff â this is a serious operation.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
Don't worry; we'll keep things light and breezy.

TAG: Mushu_006_f
{PlayerName}, I like the spirit and all, but this isn't a competition!
