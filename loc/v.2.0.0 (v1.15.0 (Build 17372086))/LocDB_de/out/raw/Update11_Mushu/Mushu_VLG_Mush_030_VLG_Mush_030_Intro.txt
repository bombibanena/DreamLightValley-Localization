{PlayerName}, just who I wanted to see! I've got a serious question for you about an event for the Village.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Is everything okay?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't have time right now.

TAG: Mushu_002_f
Okay? OKAY?

TAG: Mushu_004_f
It's BETTER than okay! I wanna throw a party!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I like where this is going.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
A costume party?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Why, though?

TAG: Mushu_007_f
I knew you would!

TAG: Mushu_011_f
So, I've been thinking about stuff... Mulan and I back in the Valley... You coming to help with the Forgetting. Things are really good around here. So I say that calls for a celebration!

TAG: Mushu_009_f
As a matter of fact, I've already got the location picked out.

TAG: Mushu_010_f
Meet me in <Lore>the Vitalys Mines</Lore>!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Well, any party could have a costume theme if you show up in a costume. I'll just leave that up to you.

TAG: Mushu_008_f
I'm glad you asked!

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Okay. I got you. No problem. Just catch me later.
