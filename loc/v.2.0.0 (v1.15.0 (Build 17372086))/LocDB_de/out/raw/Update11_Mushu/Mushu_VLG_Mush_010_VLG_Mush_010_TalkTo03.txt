Okay, let's talk lighting for our statue... I was thinking it'd be kinda nice for us to light the torches around it together.

I'd love to do that with you.

Why does a statue need dramatic lighting?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Will lighting help you remember your Guardian duties?

Aw, thanks, {PlayerName}. That makes me feel real special.

I saw some <ActivityItem>Flint Rocks</ActivityItem> down on <Lore>Dazzle Beach</Lore>.

If you <Lore>break 'em up with your Pickaxe</Lore>, you can use 'em to light some of the statue's torches.

And the rest will be taken care of by yours truly and his fabulous fire breath!

C'mon! EVERYTHING is better with dramatic lighting!

And fire will just give it that warm, comfy glow.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
You bet it will! If I ever forget my duties, one thing will definitely still get my attention...

The awesome statue you made, covered in flowers and gems and lit by FIRE!
