Ooh, these are PERFECT for our meeting! I'll set 'em up once we're ready.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're SO CUTE.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's next?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You can't use big chairs?

TAG: Mushu_003_f
Yeah, yeah. Enough with the "cute"! The important thing is they're the kinda chairs our members need!

TAG: Mushu_006_f
Now, we need some pint-sized refreshments.

TAG: Mushu_007_f
For that, we should call in an expert. Could you <Lore>talk to our favorite tiny chef</Lore>?

TAG: Mushu_002_f
That'd be refreshments.

TAG: Mushu_004_f
We CAN, but it's a lot nicer to have something built with you in mind.
