Merlin! Gaston and I found a brush in the desert â could it belong to you?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
You know, it just might! I had completely forgotten about my beard brush!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Great! I'll get Gaston to bring it back to you.

Mickey gave that to me as a gift, long before the Forgetting.

And well, my beard has been rather out of sorts. I'll be glad to brush it thoroughly!
