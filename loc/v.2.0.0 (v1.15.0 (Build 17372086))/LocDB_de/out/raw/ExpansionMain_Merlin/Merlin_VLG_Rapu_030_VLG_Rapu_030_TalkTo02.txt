Hey, Merlin! Do you know anything about time magic?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific. Time travel? Freezing time? Making time fly?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Uh... No. A sort of time spell with Sundrop petals that can help Mother Gothel keep her youth.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I'm afraid I don't. The preservation of youth hasn't been a field of study I've pursued. Why, just look at my beard! Ha-ha!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's an impressive beard.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So... you DON'T know about an eternal youth charm?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I thought it was a costume beard.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Well, I'm rather proud of it, you know.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
{PlayerName}, I'm afraid I don't currently have the knowledge to help you or Mother Gothel stave off age. You might want to seek someone whose magical pursuits lie more in the vanity realm.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
You've divined my meaning perfectly! After all, to age is a privilege!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
A costume â a COSTUME?! Hardly! I assure you this is all very genuine and earned with experience!
