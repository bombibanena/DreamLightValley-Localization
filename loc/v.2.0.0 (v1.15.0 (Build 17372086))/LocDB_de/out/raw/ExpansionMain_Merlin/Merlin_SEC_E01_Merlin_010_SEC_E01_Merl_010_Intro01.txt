Ah, {PlayerName}, marvelous timing, as usual! I've been exploring Eternity Isle and it's... it's...

TAG: Merlin_021_f
...well, it's a marvel! So much to study here and much to discover!

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
I'm happy you're happy.

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
Just glad I have more room to decorate.

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
Uh-oh. You seem a little overstimulated.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Ha-ha! Yes. That's the wonder of happiness. A candle whose flame never extinguishes, no matter how much it's shared.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Oh, and speaking of sharing... have you discovered anything about Eternity Isle that you'd like to share with me?

TAG: Merlin_027_f
That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
I'm learning about how this <ActivityItem>Royal Hourglass</ActivityItem> works. But I'd love to learn even more about this place!

TAG: Merlin_029_f
Ah, yes, the Royal Hourglass! Quite the stroke of luck you've found it. No doubt it will help us discover all the wonders of this Isle.

TAG: Merlin_030_f
You see, the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> in your Hourglass lets it repair spots where time has... well, I suppose you could say, time has broken.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
Keep using the <ActivityItem>Royal Hourglass</ActivityItem> to obtain more <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem>, so you may uncover more of this Island.

TAG: Merlin_032_f
Now then, Mist appears to be connected to both <Lore>using the Hourglass AND caring for Eternity Isle</Lore>.

TAG: Player_005_f
No problem! To find more Mist, I'll just keep...

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
...decorating and cleaning up the Island!

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
...finding treasures with my Hourglass!

TAG: Player_005_choice_003_f
...uncovering the secrets of this place!

TAG: Merlin_033_f
That's using your intellect! And I presume you've also begun to <Lore>uncover the magic of Timebending Tables</Lore>?

TAG: Merlin_034_f
Only a little... but I'd love to know more!

TAG: Merlin_035_f
Well, there's no better way to learn than to experiment! Here.

TAG: Merlin_036_f
I uncovered this Timebending Table while exploring the Island.

TAG: Merlin_037_f
Contained within it are <Lore>echoes of items which once stood here on Eternity Isle</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_038_f
If you <Lore>examine the Timebending Table</Lore>, you'll see how to <Lore>reconstruct those items</Lore> with materials you find using the Hourglass.

TAG: Merlin_039_f
I look forward to seeing what sort of magic you work!

TAG: Merlin_023_f
Yes, this Isle does offer more opportunities for that sort of thing.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Though, I'll stick to my research and leave the decorating to you.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Don't be ridiculous There's no such thing as too much intellectual curiosity!
