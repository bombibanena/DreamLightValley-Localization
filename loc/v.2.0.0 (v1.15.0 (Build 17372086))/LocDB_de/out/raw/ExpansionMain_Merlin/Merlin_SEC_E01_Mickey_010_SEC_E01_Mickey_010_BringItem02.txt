Hm? Oh, what are these?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Some strange flora from around Eternity Isle.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I was hoping you could tell me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Flowers. Do you like them?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Oh, well... how fascinating. These are quite peculiar indeed.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
It's a good thing you brought them to me. We have to make sure Ursula doesn't get her hands on any of these...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
I'll need some time in the Library to research them... and some experiments may be required.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
I expect they'll keep me busy for quite a while.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's so cute when you get into your hobbies!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Think you'll be able to make something useful out of them?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
"Cute"? "Hobbies"?! I'll have you know my research is serious business!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Although, I do have quite a lot of fun doing it, I'll admit...

TAG: Merlin_012_f
In any case, I'd like to give you something to thank you for bringing me such an interesting project.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
I was doing some research with these earlier, but they're of no use to me now. Use them wisely!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
I suspect I can discover myriad uses. Possibly even something as useful as indoor plumbing.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
But more investigation is in order!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Why, er, they seem to be a peculiar type of flora. I suspect they're native to Eternity Isle.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Like them? Well, I'm certainly intrigued by them. They seem to grow only on Eternity Isle.
