Hey Remy! Can I ask you a question about candy-making?

TAG: Remy_009_f
Easy â food coloring. And you're in luck because I just made some from strawberries!

TAG: Remy_010_f
Wow, thanks Remy!

TAG: Remy_011_f
Glad I could help! Word of advice, though â be careful with water around the candy.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Spill some water on it and it could dissolve and melt away.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Gotcha â keep the candy dry! Gotta run now.

TAG: Remy_001_f
Candy-making? Wow, that's a complicated topic.

TAG: Remy_002_f
What's your question?

TAG: Remy_003_f
Well, I'm trying to make a <ActivityItem>Candy Skull</ActivityItem> for Jack Skellington for a project he has.

TAG: Remy_004_f
But he said it should be brightly colored, too, and... I'm not exactly sure how to do that.

TAG: Remy_005_f
The recipe calls for <ActivityItem>Sugarcane</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Vanilla</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Fruit</ActivityItem>, but well... I feel like something is missing.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Well, those three Ingredients would make a delicious candy.

TAG: Remy_007_f
But the final result would be pretty dull, visually.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Hmm, what would you suggest?
