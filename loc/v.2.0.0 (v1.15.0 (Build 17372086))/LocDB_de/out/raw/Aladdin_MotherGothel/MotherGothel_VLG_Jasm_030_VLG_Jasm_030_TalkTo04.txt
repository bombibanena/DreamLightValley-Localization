{PlayerName}! What are YOU doing here?!

TAG: MotherGothel_001_f
I think you know why I'm here, Mother Gothel.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Of course YOU would steal a magic flower!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
How could you do this AGAIN?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm really disappointed in you.

TAG: MotherGothel_002_f
Oh, don't be so dramatic, darling.

TAG: MotherGothel_005_f
I was only borrowing it.

TAG: MotherGothel_008_f
Return the Enchanted Flower. Now.

TAG: MotherGothel_009_f
But I MUST know what it does! And what is this book inside? Does it have magical properties, too?

TAG: MotherGothel_010_f
Well?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You really need to stop trying to steal magic.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What it does is none of your business.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
If it does, it's not magic that will help you.

TAG: MotherGothel_012_f
But dear, some of us aren't blessed with natural magical abilities, so what choice do I have?

TAG: MotherGothel_015_f
Study. Practice. Put in the work.

TAG: MotherGothel_018_f
That flower is mine, not yours. And I'm in no mood to share with you.

TAG: MotherGothel_003_f
Oh, you're no fun at all!

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Fortunately, your opinion of me is irrelevant.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
You and I have different ideas of fun.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
We're done here.

TAG: MotherGothel_020_f
Well, that's rather rude.

TAG: MotherGothel_023_f
Thankfully, I'm not trying to be polite to you right now.

TAG: MotherGothel_025_f
I'm taking my Enchanted Flower back. And I better not see you lurking around Jasmine and Aladdin's House again! Got it?

TAG: MotherGothel_019_f
Fine, fine. Take your flower. It wasn't doing anything special anyway.

TAG: MotherGothel_021_f
For example, I enjoy spending time with loved ones. You, on the other hand, enjoy STEALING from them.

TAG: MotherGothel_022_f
Are we?

TAG: MotherGothel_024_f
Yes, that wasn't rhetorical.

TAG: MotherGothel_013_f
Don't be petulant, dear. It's unbecoming.

TAG: MotherGothel_016_f
I'm not really worried about that right now.

TAG: MotherGothel_014_f
How can you be certain, darling? I have ideas for magic you've never dreamed of.

TAG: MotherGothel_017_f
Actually, in this case, I can be 100% certain.

TAG: MotherGothel_006_f
Ugh! You take ONE child for her magical abilities and people REFUSE to forget it!

TAG: MotherGothel_011_f
Honestly, darling, holding a grudge like that will do nothing but keep you up at night.

TAG: MotherGothel_004_f
Oh, that breaks my heart to hear...

TAG: MotherGothel_007_f
I'm teasing! Of course, I DON'T care.
