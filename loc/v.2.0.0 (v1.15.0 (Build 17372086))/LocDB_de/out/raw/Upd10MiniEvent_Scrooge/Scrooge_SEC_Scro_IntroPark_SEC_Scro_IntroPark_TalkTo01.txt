Those sounds made no sense.

Well, before the Forgetting, the Dreamlight Parks Fest was an annual festival here in the Valley.

For a few weeks, the entire place becomes one giant amusement park!

There are special treats to bake and share, collectible popcorn buckets, festival decorations to put up, and prizes a'plenty!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How do I participate?
