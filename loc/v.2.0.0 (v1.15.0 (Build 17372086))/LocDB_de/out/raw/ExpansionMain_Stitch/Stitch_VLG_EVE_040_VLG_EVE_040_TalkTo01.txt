Hi, achi-baba! What you want from Stitch?

TAG: Player_000_f
Fireworks...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The other Villagers would love that!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Anything to avoid EVE setting fire to something else.

TAG: Stitch_002_f
Do you know who EVE is?

TAG: Stitch_003_f
EVE! Yeah! Yeah!

TAG: Stitch_004_f
EVE fly and make things go...

TAG: Stitch_005_f
...BOOM!

TAG: Stitch_006_f
That's her. Well, she's looking for something a little more exciting to do, and I was thinking that you two couldâ

Stitch has idea! Stitch talk to Old Beard Man.

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Old Beard Man? Do you mean... Merlin?

TAG: Stitch_009_f
Yeah! Make fireworks. Pretty rockets that go boom!

TAG: Stitch_010_f
Feeboogoo!

TAG: Stitch_013_f
Old Beard Man gave Stitch <ActivityItem>Recipe</ActivityItem> and one Ingredient... <ActivityItem>Cactus Powder</ActivityItem>. Here.

TAG: Stitch_000_f
Wait, Merlin gave YOU a <ActivityItem>Fireworks Recipe</ActivityItem>? That's surprising...

TAG: Stitch_014_f
Old Beard Man leave for Stitch on desk under books. Stitch borrow. No problem!

TAG: Stitch_015_f
Uh... sounds more like you took it from him, but we'll deal with that later. For now, I'll go talk to EVE about this project.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Yes. Stitch thinks so too.

TAG: Stitch_012_f
Pretty rockets explode in sky. No fires.
