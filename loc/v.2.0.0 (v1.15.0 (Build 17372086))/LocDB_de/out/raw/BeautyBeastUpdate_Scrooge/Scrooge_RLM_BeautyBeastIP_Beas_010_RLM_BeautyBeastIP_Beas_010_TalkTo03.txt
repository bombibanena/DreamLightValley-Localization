Hey, Mr. McDuck? Can I have a feather?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's for Belle and the Beast.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It will bring a royal customer to the Valley...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm getting ready for a tickle fight.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Aye, I heard you went through the Realm door to see Belle an' his Highness.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Those two have certainly been missed around here.

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
So you'll help?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's just one teensy feather...

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Name your price. *sigh*

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I think they'll be great customers...

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
For them? An' for you, {PlayerName}, this one's on House McDuck.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
I found a real beauty under the chair in my office. I must've shed it when I was tallying the accounts last night.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
A what-now? You cannae be serious.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
You're right. I'm helping Belle and the Beast work through something.
