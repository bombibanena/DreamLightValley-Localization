{PlayerName}, I cannae wait to hear what new opportunity ya have for me today.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
It's more about something you have for me, actually. Belle and I are looking for missing <ActivityItem>Books</ActivityItem> from the Library, and you're supposed to have one of them.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Ah yes! <ActivityItem>Coin Pool Theory</ActivityItem>, a fascinating subject.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
In fact, I've a mind to keep it for myself...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You can always borrow it again.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe other people want to read it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It belongs in the Library...

TAG: Scrooge_000_f
Aye, I might just do that. After I reimburse the Library, of course.

TAG: Scrooge_025_f
Don't worry. I'll find it. One <Lore>book treasure hunt to dig it up on Dazzle Beach</Lore>, coming right up.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
But unfortunately, I no longer have the book.

TAG: Scrooge_020_f
So where is it...?

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Och, it's quite a humorous tale, actually.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
I was on Dazzle Beach digging for treasure. But alas, I couldnae find even a rusted farthing.

TAG: Scrooge_021_f
To get a bit of relief from the sun, I sat down in one of the holes I'd dug...

TAG: Scrooge_022_f
...and decided to do some reading. After a spell, I got up and filled in all the holes I'd made.

TAG: Scrooge_023_f
It was only once I got back to the Plaza that I realized the book was missing! I must've buried it by mistake.

TAG: Scrooge_024_f
I planned to go back and dig it up, but I've no idea which hole I buried it in!

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
Aye, I'm sure others would love to know the secret of making a good coin pool so they can make one for themselves.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
Aye, no need to ruffle your feathers, {PlayerName}! I would've reimbursed the Library, of course.
