Ooh, {PlayerName}, are these the spicy meals I ordered?

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
They're perfect!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You're not going to power a race kart with these, are you?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Why did you want all these?

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
No. But that is an excellent idea for later!

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
I recently discovered that when I eat a lot of spicy food and just the right amount of garlic, it gives me a power-up...

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
DRAGON BREATH!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Like... you breathe fire?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Is this a real thing or just a pretend thing?

TAG: Vanellope_006_f
Not really. But my breath gets really stinky and becomes the ULTIMATE weapon for annoying other Villagers.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
This seems like a bad idea.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
That IS pretty funny.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
Sure, if by BAD idea, you mean GREAT and SUPER HILARIOUS idea.

TAG: Vanellope_013_f
Now... time to eat and get my power-up!

TAG: Vanellope_014_f
And now to unleash my dragon breath on an unsuspecting Villager!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
I thought you'd like it!

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Oh, it's VERY real, {PlayerName}. You'll see once I eat these.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
My breath gets super stinky and becomes the ULTIMATE weapon to annoy other Villagers.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
For one very simple reason.
