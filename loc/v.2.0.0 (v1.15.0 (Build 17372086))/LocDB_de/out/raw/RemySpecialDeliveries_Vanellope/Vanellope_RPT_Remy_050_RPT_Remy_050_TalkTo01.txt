That nice lady who lives in a big House shaped like a pumpkin?

She seems okay.

How would you feel about a party based around pumpkins?

Let me tell you about the most exciting pumpkin party in town...

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Sounds like a weird inanimate object to throw a party for, but hey, count me in.

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
I do love a good party.

Then swing by the Fairy Godmother's House later! I think you'll have a great time.

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
They're okay. I especially like the ones that are carved up with creepy faces on 'em...
