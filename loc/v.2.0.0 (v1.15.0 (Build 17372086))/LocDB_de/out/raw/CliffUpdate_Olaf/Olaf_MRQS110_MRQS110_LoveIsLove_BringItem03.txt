You found them! You found my arms!

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Come here, little arms. Let me put you on...

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Oh, that's much better! I feel so "sticky." Hee-hee-hee.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
...

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Get it? 'Cause my arms are sticks?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That's hilarious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't get it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You should "arm" yourself with some better jokes.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
I thought you'd like it.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Well, I didn't just find your arms. I also found the Orb.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
There's only one problem: It seems to be broken.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
*gasp* No! What's wrong with it?

TAG: Olaf_009_f
The light inside it has gone out. The magic is just... gone.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
I don't think this is going to be enough to fix the Pillar and stop the blizzard.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
... Oh.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
I'm sorry, {PlayerName}. I wish I knew how to fix it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I can fix this. I HAVE to fix it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
There must be a way.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
It's hopeless. We're doomed.

TAG: Olaf_013_f
I just have to figure out the mystery... Maybe there's a book in Merlin's library... or another memory somewhere... or... or...

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Ahem!

TAG: Olaf_015_f
I may not know how to fix the Orb, but I do know one thing that can make everything better.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
A warm hug.

TAG: Olaf_017_f
And now that I have my arms again, I can give you one!

TAG: Player_002_f
Thanks, Olaf.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
I feel a lot better now.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I still feel awful, but I appreciate the thought.

TAG: Olaf_018_f
Yep. Warm hugs are the best.

TAG: Olaf_027_f
Does this mean we saved the day?

TAG: Olaf_028_f
Almost, but not quite.

TAG: Olaf_029_f
I still need to <Lore>put this Orb back in the Pillar</Lore>. Let's go!

TAG: Olaf_019_f
Wait a second...

TAG: Olaf_020_f
The Orb started to glow when you hugged me.

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Merlin said he didn't know what virtue powered the Pillar in the Frosted Heights. But now I know. It must be...

TAG: Olaf_022_f
Warm hugs!

TAG: Olaf_023_f
Uh. Close. But not exactly.

TAG: Olaf_024_f
It's love, Olaf.

TAG: Olaf_025_f
A simple act of love fixed the Orb.

TAG: Olaf_026_f
Oh. Then I guess I did know how to fix the Orb after all.

TAG: Olaf_030_f
Oh. Well, two hugs are even better thanâ

TAG: Olaf_031_f
Wait! I don't think I need another one.

TAG: Olaf_032_f
The blizzard's going to swallow up all of Dreamlight Valley, and nothing I do can fix this, and okay, maybe I'm freaking out just a little bitâ

TAG: Olaf_033_f
That's okay. Not everyone gets sophisticated word play.

TAG: Olaf_034_f
You're probably right. I haven't had anyone to practice my jokes on since I've been stuck in here.

TAG: Olaf_035_f
Hey, wait. "Arm" myself?

TAG: Olaf_036_f
That's brilliant! I will definitely have to use that.
