Wait â sledding is when you hurtle down the sides of snowy mountains really fast, right? If so, I'm a sledding expert!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Reason 527 why I like you! Of course, you have to be sure that you're ready for the possibility that they'll magically come to life.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Oh, you should really meet my friend Marshmallow!

He is excellent at throwing snowballs... and snow butts.

Now that I have my permafrost, I can really enjoy warmth. It's so cozy and nice, and it makes me feel giggly all over.

TAG: Olaf_012_f

Oh, you're just joking. Phew.

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Spring is so nice. I like to think of it as tiny-summer.

Fall is so pretty! I like to think of it as early-winter.
