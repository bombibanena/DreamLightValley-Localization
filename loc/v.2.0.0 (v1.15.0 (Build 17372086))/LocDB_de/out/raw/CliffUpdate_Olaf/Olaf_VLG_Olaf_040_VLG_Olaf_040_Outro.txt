Oh, {PlayerName}, we brought joy back to the Valley! So many Villagers came out to see our play!

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Anna, Buzz, Donald, Samantha...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That was so much fun, Olaf!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Who's Samantha?

I feel like we didn't just tell a story together. We lived one.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
We did! And I want you to take the stage and all the cutouts we made.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Now you can use them to decorate the Village however you'd like!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Oh! And I've got something special for you...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Before Elsa made me my permafrost, she gave me a flurry to follow me around so I wouldn't melt. And I asked her to make you one just like it!

TAG: Olaf_007_f
It's a little reminder of me that you can have with you always.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
I hope we get to tell a lot more stories together, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
... I'm not sure, but I hope she enjoyed the play.
