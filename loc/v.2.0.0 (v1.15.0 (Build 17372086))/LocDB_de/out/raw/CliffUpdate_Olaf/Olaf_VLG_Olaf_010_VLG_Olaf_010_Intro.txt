Hello, {PlayerName}. I was just gonna come find you! I'm very happy to be back in the Village, but â oddly, it doesn't feel right...

TAG: Olaf_001_f
It's like something's... missing. I just don't know what.

TAG: Olaf_002_f
You're older and thus all-knowing. Could you help me figure it out?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll try to help. Tell me more.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm busy right now.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Well, this place used to be full of joy and friendship and warm hugs.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
But some of the Villagers don't seem happy at all. Like the grumpy lion and the lady who's always looking in the mirror.

TAG: Player_001_f
Grumpy lion and lady who's always looking in the mirror...? Oh, you must mean Scar and Mother Gothel.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You can't make everybody happy.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
What have you tried to make them happy so far?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
We'll get a smile out of them. Don't worry.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
They're hungry for power. If they were happy, a lot of other people in the Village wouldn't be.

TAG: Olaf_014_f
She didn't seem to be impressed.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
Maybe we could try giving them some gifts? That always cheers people up.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
*gasp* What an incredible idea! I knew you could help me, {PlayerName}. You have the innate wisdom that comes with maturity.

TAG: Olaf_017_f
And I know just what to get them! Let's start with some flowers...

TAG: Olaf_018_f
Some <ActivityItem>Red Bromeliads</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Blue Passion Lilies</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>White Passion Lilies</ActivityItem> would make an exquisite bouquet.

TAG: Olaf_019_f
And of course, we'll need some <ActivityItem>Salmon</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Olaf_020_f
Salmon...? Why?

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Just trust me on this one, {PlayerName}. It's all going to make a wonderful gift.

TAG: Olaf_022_f
Why don't you go find everything while I figure out what to write on the cards?

TAG: Olaf_023_f
Ahem. "Dear Scar..." Next one, "Dear Mother Gothel..." Hmm. No. "To my most esteemed fellow Villager..."

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Wow. So you're saying that some conceptions of happiness are at odds with others and maximizing the happiness of everyone is practically impossible?

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Uhhhh... that's a very grown-up thought. Let's keep it simple.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
What have you tried doing to make Scar and Mother Gothel happy so far?

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Well, I tried to give Scar a warm hug...

TAG: Olaf_010_f
...but my permafrost got stuck to his fur, and he didn't like it.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Then I tried to tell Mother Gothel some fascinating trivia.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Like what...?

TAG: Olaf_013_f
I told her that the average human breathes in and out twenty-two thousand times a day.

TAG: Olaf_024_f
We just have to keep trying. What have you done to make Mother Gothel and Scar happy so far?

TAG: Olaf_025_f
Okay. I'll just stay here and try to make the best out of what I can control!
