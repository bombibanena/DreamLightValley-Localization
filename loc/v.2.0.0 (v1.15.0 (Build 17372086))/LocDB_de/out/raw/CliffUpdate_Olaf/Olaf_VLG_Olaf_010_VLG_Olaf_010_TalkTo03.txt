That's it! That's what's missing from the Village!

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Stories! Before the Forgetting, I was the <Lore>Official Village Storyteller</Lore>!

TAG: Olaf_002_f
That's how I brought joy to the Village.

And there used to be a great big stage in the Frosted Heights...

TAG: Olaf_004_f
...and everyone would gather around it, and we'd put on plays!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
There isn't any stage in the Frosted Heights. It must have been destroyed during the Forgetting...

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Oh... how sad.

TAG: Player_000_f
Don't be sad! We'll build a new stage.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It'll be just as good as the old one.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It'll be EVEN BETTER than the old one!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It probably won't be as nice as the old one... but I'll do my best.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
We will? Thank you! And I even think I remember how we built the old stage...

TAG: Olaf_008_f
We used some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Rope</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Olaf_009_f
I wonder where we got the <ActivityItem>Curtain</ActivityItem> though...

TAG: Olaf_010_f
I know someone who could help us with that. Minnie! She's great at all sorts of creative things.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Okay! Let's gather everything up, make the stage, and start telling stories again!
