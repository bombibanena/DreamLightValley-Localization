You found a book? Is it the one we need? You'll have to read it to me since I can't turn the pages.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Okay. It's called "So You Want to Open a Dark Portal."

TAG: Olaf_002_f
How conveniently specific! It sounds like it's exactly what we're looking for, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I hope so...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Do you think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Not a very imaginative title.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
I can't wait to hear what it says!

TAG: Olaf_012_f
How do I do that...?

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Well, there are some gems over there near the portal. But not all the colors. Some must be missing.

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Don't worry, {PlayerName}. I'm sure you can figure out what to do.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
Finally, it says I need to whisper one of my darkest fears to the portal to seal the spell. I guess I should start thinking about what I'm afraid of...

TAG: Olaf_016_f
But for now, I'll start by <Lore>making the Dreamlight Prism</Lore>.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
(This book... this must be how the Forgotten learned to open all those portals in the first place.)

TAG: Olaf_005_f
(No wonder they've been popping up everywhere.)

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Um... Are you going to read?

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Hmm... According to this, we'll need something called a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Prism</ActivityItem> to fix the portal.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
There's a bunch of broken glass on the floor over there. I'll bet the Forgotten tried this too.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Maybe if you gather it up and replace the broken parts, we can get my arms back! Oh, and the Orb. Can't forget about that.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
It says we'll need some <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem> and some <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
But once I fix it, I need to find some way to "channel all the colors of the rainbow" through the prism.

TAG: Olaf_017_f
Titles can be hard. I went through at least three dozen for each of the novels I've composed in my head while I've been here.
