{PlayerName}, you're older, and thus all-knowing. Do you ever worry about the notion that nothing is permanent?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What?

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Really? Tell me: How do you cope with the constant uncertainty of the ever-shifting landscape of life?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Friends.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Ignoring it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What?

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Oh, that makes sense. I too find friendship very comforting.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Huh... But does ignoring things make them go away? I fear there could be some unanticipated long-term effects.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
What indeed. And also "why." When faced with the staggering complexities and mysteries of life, both are very significant questions.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Oh, and we can't forget "who"! Who are we to ask such questions, really?

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Really? Anna said the same thing. I can't wait until I'm ancient like both of you, so I don't have to worry about important things.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
How old do you think I need to be for everything in the world to make sense?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
At least five.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Maybe forty?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Never.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
I have to wait that long for all of my existential worries to be resolved? Wow. Growing up takes forever!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Whoa! That old?! There's so much uncertainty. I wonder if I can accelerate it by reading more.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Mr. McDuck is going to have to order me a LOT more books!

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Oh. I hadn't anticipated that.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Oh well. I guess it's time to resign myself to the perpetual anxiety of existence!
