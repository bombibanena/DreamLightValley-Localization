I'm so glad you're here! It's almost time to put on our play, and there's so much work left to do!

My nose is itchy... and my eyelid won't stop twitching...

TAG: Olaf_002_f
{PlayerName}... I think I may be experiencing... anxiety?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sorry, but I'm busy right now.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
Well, we've got the stage, and our script, and our cast...

TAG: Olaf_004_f
But we don't have any props or a set!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
We need some scenery to make the stage look like the Forest of Valor.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Tell me, {PlayerName}. Would you say you're artistically inclined?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Definitely! I can make some great cutouts.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm a little artistic. I'll try my best at some cutouts.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Oh boy. This is going to be a disaster. But stage cutouts it is.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Well, if your talents match the boundlessness of your enthusiasm, we're gonna be great!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
I'll go find some <ActivityItem>Dry Wood</ActivityItem> to make the cutouts.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Oh, that sounds perfect! I can picture it already...

TAG: Olaf_011_f
And I'll keep picturing it as I go find the props while you make all that.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Oh, {PlayerName}. I'm sure your best will be wonderful!

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Don't worry. I believe in you.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Maybe grind up some <ActivityItem>Green Passion Lilies</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>White Impatiens</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Orange Marsh Milkweed</ActivityItem> to paint them with...

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Oh, okay. I guess part of getting older is learning to deal with stress on my own...
