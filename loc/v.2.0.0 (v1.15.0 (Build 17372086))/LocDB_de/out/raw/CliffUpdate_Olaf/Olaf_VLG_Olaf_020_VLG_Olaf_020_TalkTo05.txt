Did you talk to Donald and Kristoff? Tell me everything.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Wait, wait... let me close my eyes, so I can picture it all in my imagination...

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Well... it all started on the Sunlit Plateau when they faced down a dragon... or possibly a hummingbird...

TAG: Olaf_003_f
And that's it! That's everything Kristoff and Donald told me.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
But that's two completely different stories. Huh...

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Who do you think was telling the truth?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Kristoff.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Donald.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Truth is in the eye of the beholder.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
I'm sure you're right. Kristoff's very honest, and his story is more believable...

TAG: Olaf_015_f
...the <Lore>Pillar of Courage</Lore> in the Forest of Valor...

TAG: Olaf_016_f
...the <Lore>Elephant Graveyard</Lore> on the Sunlit Plateau...

TAG: Olaf_017_f
...and the <Lore>Ruins</Lore> in the Forgotten Lands?

TAG: Olaf_018_f
Will do! I'll be back soon.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
...but Donald's is so much more exciting!

TAG: Olaf_008_f
I'm gonna ask him to help me write the scripts. This is going to be a play to remember.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Oh, but this story has so many locations.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
The Sunlit Plateau, the Forgotten Lands, the Forest of Valor...

TAG: Olaf_011_f
I really should see them all while I write so I can fully capture the ambiance.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
No problem. I have this thing called a "camera." I can use it to take some pictures for you. Then you'll be able to look at them to set the scene!

TAG: Olaf_013_f
That would be wonderful! Thank you, {PlayerName}. You're truly a friend of the theater.

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Could you get me pictures of...

TAG: Olaf_019_f
Really? Great! Donald's story is much more exciting!

TAG: Olaf_020_f
I'm afraid that theme won't be very gripping for our audience, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Olaf_021_f
They want excitement... and Donald's version of the story was much more exciting!
