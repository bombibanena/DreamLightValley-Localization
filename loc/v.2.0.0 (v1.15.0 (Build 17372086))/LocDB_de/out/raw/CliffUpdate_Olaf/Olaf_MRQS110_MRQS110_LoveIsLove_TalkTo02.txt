TAG: Olaf_000_f
Oh! You found me!

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Hooray! That means I'm "it."

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Now, it's your turn to hide. My advice: Choose a good spot. Anna says my finding abilities are epic!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Olaf?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Huh? Is this a game?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What are you doing in here?

TAG: Olaf_003_f
{PlayerName}! It's you!

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Wait â you look taller than I remember.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
I suppose the last time we saw each other was a long time ago. Way back before the Forgetting.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Does that mean you're all grown up now?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's right.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I guess so. Even if I don't feel like it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
"Grown up" is a state of mind. I'm a kid at heart.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Well, I hope you're not too grown up to finish playing our game.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Now it's your turn to hide and my turn to seek. Ready?

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Let's hide and seek later. But first...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What is this place?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
What happened to you?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I need your help fixing a magical mess.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
You know, I'm not exactly sure. I think maybe it used to be your special room.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
My special room? What do you mean?

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Well, you came here when you wanted to be alone.

TAG: Olaf_013_f
To get away from all the complexities of life and ponder the meaning of the universe.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
That makes sense. We all need time to be alone.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
But I love being around people.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
I wish I could remember this...

TAG: Olaf_014_f
That is so true.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
There's so much strange magic in here. I wonder where it all comes from.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
As do I. This truly is a chamber filled with mysteries...

TAG: Olaf_017_f
Oh, but everyone needs solitude sometimes. When else would we ponder the great questions?

TAG: Olaf_018_f
Don't worry. I have an excellent memory. I'll do the remembering for both of us.

TAG: Olaf_019_f
Well, I followed you in here one day, there was a bright flash of light...

TAG: Olaf_020_f
...and then you were gone. And I've been here ever since. Mainly because I couldn't get out.

TAG: Player_004_choice_000_f
That's awful!

TAG: Player_004_choice_001_f
A bright flash of light...?

TAG: Player_004_choice_002_f
You don't seem very bothered about it.

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Well, I did get lonely. And I missed you and all my friends.

TAG: Olaf_050_f
But I've composed twelve epic novels in my head while I've been here. It's a series. I'll recite them to you later.

TAG: Olaf_022_f
Technically, it's against the hide-and-seek rules to use magic, but I presume you had a good reason.

TAG: Olaf_023_f
Well, I did prove that it's a great hiding spot. Look how long it took you to find me!

TAG: Olaf_051_f
And I've composed twelve epic novels in my head while I've been here. It's a series. I'll recite them to you later.

TAG: Olaf_024_f
There's a magical blizzard that's threatening the whole Village.

TAG: Olaf_025_f
If we're going to stop it, we need to find the Orb and restore the Pillarâ

TAG: Olaf_026_f
Ooo, I very much want to help, but first I'm in need of some assistance myself.

TAG: Olaf_027_f
You've probably noticed that I'm missing my nose, my buttons, and my arms.

TAG: Player_005_choice_000_f
I thought you looked a little different.

TAG: Player_005_choice_001_f
Wow, really? I hadn't noticed.

TAG: Player_005_choice_002_f
I didn't want to make a big deal about it.

TAG: Olaf_028_f
Some might like the minimalist look, but I'm much more fond of my full Olaf-ness.

TAG: Olaf_029_f
I'll help you get all your parts back. I think when I came in I saw some squirrels carrying them off...

TAG: Olaf_030_f
Oh, right! Silly me. Those squirrels are my friends.

TAG: Olaf_031_f
Did you know there are over two hundred species of squirrels?!

TAG: Olaf_032_f
But the ones here don't look like the squirrels I've seen before. They're all mysterious and glow-y.

TAG: Olaf_033_f
Still, they like to play keep-away with me, which is nice. It helps to pass the time. They take my buttons and nose, and I chase them around to get them back.

TAG: Player_006_choice_000_f
Sounds fun.

TAG: Player_006_choice_001_f
Are you sure this was just a game...?

TAG: Olaf_034_f
It is!

TAG: Olaf_035_f
Especially for the squirrels.

TAG: Olaf_036_f
But this time, when you came in, the squirrels ran out right past you with my nose and buttons.

TAG: Olaf_037_f
I've only ever had to chase them around here before.

TAG: Olaf_038_f
Okay. I'll help you get them back.

TAG: Olaf_039_f
Great. <Lore>Let's chase down some squirrels!</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_040_f
Well, I thought so.

TAG: Olaf_041_f
But as for the squirrels... well, who can really comprehend the mind of a squirrel?

TAG: Olaf_042_f
That's uncharacteristically unobservant of you. I would think it's as plain as the nose that's not on my face.

TAG: Olaf_043_f
Thank you. That was very polite.

TAG: Olaf_044_f
That's a relief! If you don't feel like a grown-up, then you won't be too grown-up to finish our game.

TAG: Olaf_045_f
Oh, good! I was worried you'd be too busy with grown-up matters to finish our game.

TAG: Olaf_046_f
Of course, {PlayerName}! Don't you remember? We're playing hide-and-seek.

TAG: Olaf_047_f
I'm hiding from you, {PlayerName}. And you are...? C'mon, you know it...

TAG: Olaf_048_f
Okay, I'll help you out. You're seeking me.

TAG: Olaf_049_f
Do you need me to explain the rules again?
