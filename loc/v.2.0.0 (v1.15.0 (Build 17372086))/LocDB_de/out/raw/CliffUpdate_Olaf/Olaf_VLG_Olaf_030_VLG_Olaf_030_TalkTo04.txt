Ooh, {PlayerName}! Did you talk to Mr. McDuck, Buzz Lightyear, and Anna about auditioning for the play?

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Er, yeah. Mr. McDuck said the pay wasn't worth it.

TAG: Olaf_002_f
And Buzz... I don't know if he's got the range for this role.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
What about Anna?

TAG: Olaf_004_f
She said she'd love to audition!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I think she'd be great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think she'd be okay.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
She was basically the only option.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Oh, I'm sure Anna will be perfect for the role. Let's go audition her right now!
