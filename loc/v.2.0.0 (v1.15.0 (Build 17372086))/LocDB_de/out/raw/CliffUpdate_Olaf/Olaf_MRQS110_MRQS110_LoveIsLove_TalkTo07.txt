{PlayerName}! I have to know... Are we any closer to solving the mystery of my missing arms?

TAG: Olaf_001_f
I think so!

TAG: Olaf_002_f
Elsa helped me use my Watering Can to bring out a memory near the Pillar in the Frosted Heights.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
I saw the Forgotten pulling the Orb out of the Pillar.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
The Forgotten? But it looked just like YOU.

TAG: Player_000_f
Yeah. The Forgotten has my face.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're some sort of magical splinter of me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's a long story. Don't ask.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Oh, like I'm a part of Elsa. How fascinating.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
I guess it is sort of like that.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Well, I certainly thought the Forgotten was you when we were playing hide-and-seek.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
You'd been missing for a long time, but we were still in the middle of a game.

TAG: Olaf_009_f
So I followed you â er, the Forgotten â so I could tag you, and you'd finally come back to the Village.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
And then I saw the Forgotten had dropped that shiny Orb. So I picked it up and came in here to give it back.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
But then what happened...?

TAG: Olaf_012_f
I don't remember. But you can <Lore>use your Watering Can around here to find out</Lore>!

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Okay, but you'll have to tell me later. I love stories! The longer, the better!

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Sure. Later. Right now, we've gotta figure out what happened.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
Merlin helped me use my Watering Can to bring out a memory near the Pillar in the Frosted Heights.
