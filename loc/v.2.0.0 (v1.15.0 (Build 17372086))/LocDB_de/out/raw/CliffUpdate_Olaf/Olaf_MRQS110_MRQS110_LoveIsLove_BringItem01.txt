You got my nose and buttons back! Thank you! I'll feel much more like myself now.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Hey, did you know that squirrels use their tails to help them balance in high places?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I did know that. It's so cool!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I didn't know that. Fascinating.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That doesn't really seem relevant right now...

TAG: Olaf_002_f
I agree. Squirrels are a source of almost infinite interesting facts.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
And now we have one to add... They like to play keep-away with carrots.

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Are you ready, little nose? Let's put you back where you belong.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Oh, this is so much better!

TAG: Olaf_006_f
I'd give you a warm hug to say thank you, but I'm still missing my arms, so that would be difficult.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Where could those be...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
They've gotta be here somewhere.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
*sigh* Okay, I'll go find two sticks.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Oh! I Just remembered! It's not only my arms that are missing. They were holding something when I lost them.

TAG: Olaf_008_f
Didn't you say you were looking for some kind of Orb?

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Well, I was holding one when I got locked in here. Don't you just love coincidences?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
So if we find your arms... we'll find the Orb!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Great. So just tell me where to find your arms.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
You couldn't have told me this a little sooner?!

TAG: Olaf_010_f
Excellent deductive reasoning, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Ooo! And we can also deduce that if I don't know what happened to my arms... I don't know what happened to the Orb.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
You don't know what happened to your arms?

TAG: Olaf_013_f
As I said before...

TAG: Olaf_014_f
All I remember is that I walked in here, and there was a flash of light.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
The next thing I knew, my arms were gone. And so was the Orb. And I was locked inside.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
Ugh. If only there were some way to tell exactly what happened in here. But it was so long ago.

TAG: Olaf_017_f
Well, if you don't remember, and I don't remember...

TAG: Olaf_018_f
...maybe the water remembers!

TAG: Olaf_019_f
The water remembers...? What do you mean?

TAG: Olaf_020_f
Oh, water has memory. It's disputed by many, but it's true. We'll just need to find a way to get it to share the memories with us.

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Hmm... Say, would Elsa know something about this?

TAG: Olaf_022_f
Elsa! That's it! She's very good at helping water show us what it remembers.

TAG: Olaf_023_f
All right. I'll go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore>.

TAG: Olaf_024_f
Hmm... well, there's one person I always know I can go to when there's magical business I don't understand.

TAG: Olaf_025_f
Merlin, of course.

TAG: Olaf_026_f
Merlin? Oh, he's the oldest and thus the most all-knowing person in the Village.

TAG: Olaf_027_f
I'm sure he'll know what to do.

TAG: Olaf_028_f
I'll go <Lore>talk to Merlin</Lore> and find out.

TAG: Olaf_029_f
Hmm... let me think... umm... Nope!

TAG: Olaf_030_f
I have no idea what happened to my arms.

TAG: Olaf_031_f
Oh no. Seriously?

TAG: Olaf_032_f
If I'd known your arms were holding the key to fixing all this, I would've looked for those before I worried about finding your nose. Where are they?

TAG: Olaf_033_f
Oh, but it's always a good time to learn.

TAG: Olaf_034_f
Even when squirrels have just taken your nose.
