You know, {PlayerName}, you are a VERY talented chef. Any chance you want to come work for me?

TAG: Player_000_f
Actually, I have a restaurant for YOU in my Village!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It would be a great new challenge!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We could cook together again!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You'll have new customers!

TAG: Remy_002_f
Huh... I do love a cooking challenge. And this might be a good time to do some research.

TAG: Remy_003_f
You know what, I'll do it. I'll go to your Village and help you with your restaurant!

Wait, does this job offer come with housing?

TAG: Remy_008_f
I can't sleep in the kitchen. Wouldn't be hygienic.

TAG: Remy_010_f
I'll definitely need a House before I can go.

TAG: Remy_004_f
I'd like that! We make a good team.

Colette and Linguini can manage without me for a while...

I do like feeding new people and learning their favorite dishes.
