Clearly you know your way around the kitchen. Evidence â your two dishes.

But we need to hurry! The food critic is getting impatient out there.

Are you ready to make something a little more complicated?

I'm here to help you.

Anything for you to come to my Village.

TAG: Remy_005_f
And I REALLY appreciate that.

Because I need you to make a three-course dinner.

TAG: Remy_008_f
It'll be tonight's prix fixe. And hey, you can even design it.

TAG: Remy_004_f
First choose an appetizer: <ActivityItem>Hearty Salad</ActivityItem> or <ActivityItem>Bell Pepper Puffs</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Player_000_f
Let's go with the...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Hearty Salad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Bell Pepper Puffs.

TAG: Remy_001_f
Okay, then you'll need lettuce and two vegetables.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Okay, then you'll need a bell pepper, some cheese and an egg.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Love that attitude! And you're gonna need it.

TAG: Remy_015_f
Next I need you to prepare a three-course dinner!

TAG: Remy_007_f
Your Village? So you're a recruiter?
