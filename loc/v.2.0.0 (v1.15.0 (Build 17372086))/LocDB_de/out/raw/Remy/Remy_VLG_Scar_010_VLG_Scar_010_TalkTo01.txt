Oh, hey there, {PlayerName}! Great to see you. I hope you're here for some food because I have some fabulous things on the menu!

Wait... that coat you're wearing.

It reminds me of something...

TAG: Remy_008_f
Someone.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Oh. Oh no.

He's so hungry that the rest of the Villagers look like food to him.

TAG: Remy_002_f
And I do love a challenge. *breath* *sigh* ... Even one as dangerous as feeding a lion.

You're gonna have to help me by preparing the main course. I'm thinking fresh sushi. It's best when it's just been made.

TAG: Remy_012_f
I'll handle the dessert.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Here are the recipes to prepare.

You're right; not even someone who terrifies me. Usually, critics don't eat the chef when they're not happy with the meal.

TAG: Remy_004_f
*gulp* Which means I'm on the menu. Well, let's do what we can to avoid that!

TAG: Remy_001_f
Or is this about something else?

TAG: Remy_013_f
Well... you see... there's this hungry lion in the Village...

TAG: Remy_014_f
A hungry lion?!
