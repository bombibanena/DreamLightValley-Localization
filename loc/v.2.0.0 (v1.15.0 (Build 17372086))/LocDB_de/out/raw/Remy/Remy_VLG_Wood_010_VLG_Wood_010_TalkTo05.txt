So what did you think of Woody's meals?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
The good news is... I survived.

Now I know what it's like to eat garbage.

I didn't think you could cook disappointment with a side of indigestion.

But if you had to eat any more of it, you'd wish you hadn't, right?

If there's anyone around here who can help Woody fix this disaster, it's you, {PlayerName}.

Hey, maybe you'll become his Gusteau...

TAG: Remy_006_f
Hey now. I've eaten garbage. Those meals definitely weren't as bad as garbage.

TAG: Remy_007_f
They were worse.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Me neither.

Woody's discovering whole new sides of the culinary arts.
