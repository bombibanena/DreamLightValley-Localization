Okay, so I have an idea. Or, most likely, a memory.

TAG: Remy_007_f
It seems like there are memories all over this Valley.

Anyway, I can half remember a dish I made once.

TAG: Remy_000_f
It was frozen. Sweet. A dessert... There was something magical about it.

If it's magic, Merlin might know about it. I could go ask him.

Listening to you makes me hungry. I'm going to get something to eat.

TAG: Remy_008_f
That would be great! If he thinks of anything, let me know.

Well, if you're hungry, I know a guy with a restaurant.
