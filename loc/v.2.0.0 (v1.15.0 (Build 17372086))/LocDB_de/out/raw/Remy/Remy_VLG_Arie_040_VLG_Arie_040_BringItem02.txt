Oh hey, {PlayerName}! What's up?

TAG: Player_000_f
Let's talk about your passion for cooking...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It would help me a lot.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
We're doing an experiment.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
And don't ask why.

TAG: Remy_001_f
Of course, {PlayerName}. I love talking about food.

So, as you might have noticed, I'm a rat. And rats aren't usually chefs. Or interested in fine cuisine.

TAG: Remy_008_f
But the first time I tasted a really good meal, I was hooked! And then when I combined my first ingredients...

TAG: Remy_009_f
The thrill of discovery. The artistry of combining flavors to create something new. I knew I had found my calling.

TAG: Remy_004_f
And now every time I cook, it's the same feeling all over again. I gotta tell you, it's pretty great.

TAG: Player_001_f
You did it! You enchanted the <ActivityItem>Stone Slab</ActivityItem> with <Lore>Fiery Passion</Lore>!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Thank you, Remy!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Now, I have to find someone willing to talk about Excitement...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Two down, two to go.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Sure. Happy to help.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Now, I have to find someone willing to talk about <Lore>Exuberant Excitement</Lore>...

TAG: Remy_003_f
Then you definitely need to talk to Moana. She came into my restaurant the other day and was going on and on about what a kick she gets out of sailing.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Talk to Moana... got it! Thanks!

TAG: Remy_010_f
Right. Hey, whenever magic's involved, I try not to ask too many questions.

TAG: Remy_014_f
I just have to find someone willing to talk about <Lore>Exuberant Excitement</Lore>...

TAG: Remy_005_f
I'm gonna guess it's not a cooking experiment...

TAG: Remy_006_f
Uh... well, okay...
