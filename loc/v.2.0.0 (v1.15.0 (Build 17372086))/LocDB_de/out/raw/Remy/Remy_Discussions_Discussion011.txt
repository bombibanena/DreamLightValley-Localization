{PlayerName}, do you prefer savory things or sweet things?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Savory.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sweet.

TAG: Remy_001_f
Good choice. That gives you an extremely wide variety of flavor profiles to enjoy.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Okay, do you enjoy salty, savory things? Or fermented things like cheeses? Or spicy stews?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Salty.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Fermented.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Spicy stews.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Got it. I have to be careful not to make meals too salty.

TAG: Remy_007_f
But a touch of salt improves almost any savory meal.

TAG: Remy_005_f
I agree. I hate to be a clichÃ©, but I am INCREDIBLY fond of aged cheese.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Excellent! On a cold day, there's nothing better than a spicy, savory stew.

TAG: Remy_002_f
A sweet tooth, huh? Well, I've been getting more interested in desserts lately.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Do you like pure sweetness? Or maybe sweet and sour? Or fruity sweets?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Pure sugar.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sweet and sour.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Fruity.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Then you might like puff pastry with powdered sugar. I'll keep that in mind.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Two flavors that complement each other amazingly! I'll keep that in mind.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Lots of desserts get their sweetness from fruit. It's a very natural source of sugar.
