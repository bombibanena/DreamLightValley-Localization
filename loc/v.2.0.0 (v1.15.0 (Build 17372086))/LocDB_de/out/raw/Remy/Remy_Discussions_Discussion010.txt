Today is all about pastries.

I'm gonna try and push my restaurant's pastry game to the next level.

But I need to focus on one at a time. What's your favorite pastry, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Croissants.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Donuts.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I like them all!

TAG: Remy_003_f
Classic. Now, the trick to croissants is getting them crisp and flaky.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Most people associate croissants with France...

TAG: Remy_007_f
...but did you know they were actually invented in Austria?

TAG: Remy_008_f
True fact! Thank you, Austria.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Donuts ARE a pastry. But I don't generally serve them.

TAG: Remy_009_f
So I don't know much about making them.

TAG: Remy_010_f
Which is something I should fix. Okay, I'm gonna learn about donuts!

TAG: Remy_005_f
Ha! You sound just like my brother, Emile. He'll eat just about anything.
