What did you just give me, {PlayerName}? It smells like a thousand dead fish...

I want to create bait for a Nautilus. It needs to stink. I want to use this <ActivityItem>Fish Gut Oil</ActivityItem> as a base...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm sorry to ask you to do this.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It's going to be fun.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe you'll be able to stomach the smell.

TAG: Remy_008_f
I'll just assume it's for a good cause...

TAG: Remy_011_f
In the meantime, I'll keep a tight lid on your <ActivityItem>Fish Gut Oil</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Remy_009_f
You and I have very different ideas of fun.

I've smelled a lot of garbage in my day. But I left that life behind me.
