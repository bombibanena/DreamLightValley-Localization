Whoa. Is that the fish that kept disappearing on us?

TAG: Remy_009_f
It's not glowing anymore. What happened?

TAG: Player_000_f
It came from the Here and There. We were wondering what to do with it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can you make a meal out of it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Should I throw it back in the pond?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We could enter it in a World's Ugliest Fish competition.

TAG: Remy_011_f
If it's edible, I can make a meal out of it.

TAG: Remy_014_f
Let me just try a tiny bite to be sure...

TAG: Remy_015_f
... Hmmm. This fish... It tastes... it tastes...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Well? How does it taste?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
The suspense is killing me.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Are you okay...? Should I get medical help?

TAG: Remy_016_f
It's delicious!

TAG: Remy_024_f
Here! Take the recipe. One <ActivityItem>Lioness Feast</ActivityItem> for Nala, made with extra appreciation for the protector of the Valley.

TAG: Remy_018_f
Lightly sweet, salty, and with just a bit of tangy acidity.

TAG: Remy_019_f
I know exactly how I'm going to serve this!

TAG: Remy_003_f
A nice, slow simmering stew with <ActivityItem>Tomatoes</ActivityItem>... <ActivityItem>Mushrooms</ActivityItem>... and maybe a dash of <ActivityItem>Oregano</ActivityItem>...

TAG: Remy_010_f
Wait! It was Nala's idea to try eating this fish in the first place.

TAG: Remy_020_f
And if it weren't for her, this whole Village might have gotten sucked into the Here and There.

TAG: Remy_021_f
Why don't I <ActivityItem>make this meal for Nala</ActivityItem> first?

TAG: Remy_022_f
That'd be perfect, {PlayerName}!

TAG: Remy_023_f
And we should name it in her honor.

TAG: Remy_017_f
Am I okay? I'm amazing!

TAG: Remy_012_f
No! Not yet. It might not look like much, but neither do <ActivityItem>Fugu Fish</ActivityItem> or <ActivityItem>Shrimp</ActivityItem>, and those can be delicious.

TAG: Remy_013_f
It would probably win. But it doesn't matter how it looks. What matters is how it tastes.
