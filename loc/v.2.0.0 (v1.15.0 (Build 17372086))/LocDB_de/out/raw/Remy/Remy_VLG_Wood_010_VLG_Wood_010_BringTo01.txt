Whoa! Did Woody cook all this?

TAG: Remy_000_f
Gusteau was right! Anyone CAN cook. Even Woody.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Yep, it was all Woody.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It was a team effort. Woody helped.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I did most of the work myself.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Sure. But something tells me he learned a lot from you.

TAG: Remy_001_f
I hope he won't let one bad experience discourage him from trying again.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. Once again you've helped save my restaurant. You're the best!

TAG: Remy_010_f
Kind of like Linguini and me.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Well, I'm sure Woody learned a lot by watching you. I hope he won't let one bad experience discourage him from trying again.
