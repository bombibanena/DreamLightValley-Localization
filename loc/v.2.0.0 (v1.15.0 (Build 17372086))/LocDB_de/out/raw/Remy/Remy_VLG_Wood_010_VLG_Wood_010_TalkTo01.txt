{PlayerName}! Sorry, but if you need a special order, you'll have to wait. I'm swamped...

I know. Woody told me about his little cooking disaster...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm here to help.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you think went wrong?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm here for the drama. Tell me everything.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Oh! Thank you! After those meals Woody made, I need all the help I can get.

I believed Gusteau when he said anyone can cook. But after tasting Woody's cooking... well...

TAG: Remy_003_f
Let's just say that not even Anton Ego could find the words to describe those dishes.

TAG: Remy_004_f
You know what? Here. Taste for yourself.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Um... everything!

TAG: Remy_002_f
There's not much to tell...
