Oh, goodness! What's this?

TAG: Minnie_002_f
It's a gift. From Mickey.

TAG: Minnie_003_f
A bouquet! Oh, {PlayerName}, it's... it's...

TAG: Minnie_004_f
...so original. Did Mickey make it?

TAG: Minnie_005_f
No. I did...

TAG: Minnie_006_f
How kind of you.

TAG: Minnie_007_f
I'm very grateful, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
But before you go, I wanted to make sure that everything is all right. You haven't seemed quite yourself lately.

(I just want to be left alone!!)

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
(UGH! UGH! UGH!)

TAG: Minnie_009_f
...

TAG: Minnie_010_f
I'm fine.

TAG: Minnie_011_f
That's good to hear. And thank you for the flowers. It was a lovely gesture.

TAG: Minnie_012_f
I'll go find a vase for them right away. They look like they just need a little love and care. Like all of us, sometimes.
