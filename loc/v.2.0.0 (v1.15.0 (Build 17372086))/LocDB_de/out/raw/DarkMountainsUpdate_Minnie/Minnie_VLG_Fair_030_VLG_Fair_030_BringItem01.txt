A cup of <ActivityItem>Peppermint Tea</ActivityItem>? Oh {PlayerName}, that's so sweet!

TAG: Minnie_001_f
The Fairy Godmother asked me to bring it to you!

TAG: Minnie_002_f
Oh, how kind... Um, could you ask her to come see me when she has a moment?

TAG: Minnie_003_f
I don't want to ask more of her when she's constantly helping everyone, but... she enchanted something in my House and... Well, there seems to be a problem with it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sure, I'll tell her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What do you mean?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Okay, now I'm scared...

TAG: Minnie_004_f
Oh, thank you! It's actually quite peculiar...

TAG: Minnie_005_f
You see, every night the <ActivityItem>Phonograph</ActivityItem> she enchanted for me changes to something strange.

TAG: Minnie_006_f
Could you please ask her to fix it?

TAG: Minnie_007_f
Sure. I'll even take a photo of the problem to show her.

TAG: Minnie_008_f
That's a wonderful idea! Thank you!

TAG: Minnie_009_f
Well, every night, the <ActivityItem>Phonograph</ActivityItem> she enchanted for me changes to something strange.

TAG: Minnie_010_f
Oh, don't be. It's not scary. Just a little... odd.
