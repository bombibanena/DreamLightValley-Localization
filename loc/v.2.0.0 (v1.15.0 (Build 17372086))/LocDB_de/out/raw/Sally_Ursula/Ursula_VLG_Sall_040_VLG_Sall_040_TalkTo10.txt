Hey Ursula, can we have a little chat?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It's so nice that you're making friends with Sally!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What are you going to use the potion for?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You better not be plotting anything here...

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Why, angelfish, of course! And what would you like to discuss? Oh hello, Sally dear!

TAG: Ursula_020_f
Hello, Ursula!

TAG: Ursula_002_f
I'm trying to help Sally out with gathering the Ingredients for the potion you two are working on.

TAG: Ursula_003_f
Well, aren't you the helpful little guppy?

TAG: Ursula_004_f
I was having a hard time finding more of that <ActivityItem>Arcane Sprout</ActivityItem> you need. Do you know in which Biome we can find it?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Certainly! That one's typically found in <Lore>the Forgotten Lands</Lore>.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Now if that's all, I have some important work to attendâ

TAG: Ursula_007_f
Actually, there is one more thing I wanted to discuss.

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Oh, I adore her. She's such a doll!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
I mean... yeah â literally.

TAG: Ursula_010_f
So kind, sweet, gullible...

TAG: Ursula_011_f
... Gullible?

TAG: Ursula_012_f
What? No. Did I say that? I meant flexible! She can change potion strategies in the blink of an eye! She's really quite talented.

TAG: Ursula_018_f
That's nice of you to say, Ursula. I think we'll get back to hunting for those plants now.

TAG: Ursula_023_f
{PlayerName}, if you find the sprout before me, could you <Lore>bring it to my House</Lore>? I need to use Jack's cauldron for some preparations.

TAG: Ursula_024_f
Sure!

TAG: Ursula_019_f
Ta-ta, my two angelfish!

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Oh, nothing much, I assure you. It's for... a hair tonic.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Okay, that doesn't sound too wild.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Well, you do both have hair...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I don't believe that for a second!

TAG: Ursula_014_f
How are you finding working with Sally?

TAG: Ursula_025_f
Indeed! And mine's in salt water most of the time. It needs some extra care.

TAG: Ursula_026_f
Please, {PlayerName}, it's all right. I trust Ursula.

TAG: Ursula_027_f
Hmm, one last question...

TAG: Ursula_028_f
Ursula, what's it like working with Sally?

TAG: Ursula_021_f
Oh, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Ursula_015_f
Me? Plotting something with Sally? I'd never!

TAG: Ursula_016_f
I was more concerned about you plotting something involving Sally, to be honest.

TAG: Ursula_017_f
But I simply adore working with her!

TAG: Ursula_022_f
You see? She's my friend!
