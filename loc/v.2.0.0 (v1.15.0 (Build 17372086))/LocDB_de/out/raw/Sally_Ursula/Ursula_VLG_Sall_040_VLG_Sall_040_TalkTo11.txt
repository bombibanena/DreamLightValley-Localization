Well, well. Look who's decided to show up for my grand finale!

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Ursula! What are you doing?!

TAG: Ursula_002_f
What am *I* doing? I'm finally taking my rightful place... as co-ruler!

TAG: Ursula_003_f
I can't let you hurt Mickey and Scrooge! He JUST let me start calling him Uncle!

TAG: Ursula_004_f
Hurt? Who said anything about hurting them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Then... what are you doing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're definitely not helping them.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
How could you do this to Sally?

TAG: Ursula_005_f
Oh, just a little potion to put them COMPLETELY under my control... ensuring that my rule will be respected! With two pillars of the community in my pocket, I'm guaranteed to have the influence I deserve here.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
When I join you in ruling Dreamlight Valley, we'll need everyone to be good little guppies, or else I may have to repopulate my garden...

TAG: Ursula_010_f
And it's all thanks to Sally. I wouldn't have been able to do it without her precious little plants.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
I won't let you pull this off, Ursula. Sally and I will find a way to stop you.

TAG: Ursula_006_f
Oh, but I AM helping them. After the potion finishes doing its work, they'll be perfect subjects!

TAG: Ursula_008_f
Oh, it was a snap, dearie!

TAG: Ursula_009_f
She SO wanted a friend, and people like that are just SO easy to bend to your will, aren't they?
