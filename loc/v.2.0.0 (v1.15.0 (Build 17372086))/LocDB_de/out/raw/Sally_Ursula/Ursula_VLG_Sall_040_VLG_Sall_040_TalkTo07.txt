So... do you have anything to say for yourself?

TAG: Ursula_001_f
Why angelfish, this was all just an unfortunate misunderstanding!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Don't you angelfish me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Oh, do tell.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't believe that for an instant.

TAG: Ursula_002_f
We are way past pet names now.

TAG: Ursula_007_f
This is low, even for you, Ursula.

Sally really thought that she could be friends with you, and you just threw that away for a shot at a scheme.

TAG: Ursula_009_f
When's the last time someone actually wanted to be real friends with you?

TAG: Ursula_010_f
I... it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. If it helps, I was never going to overthrow YOU. I just wanted more influence in the Valley.

TAG: Ursula_011_f
You should have said so. But, you picked schemes over friendship, and now you have neither.

TAG: Ursula_012_f
You're going to have to live with the consequences of that choice.

TAG: Ursula_013_f
Yes, that much is clear...

TAG: Ursula_003_f
I was... merely trying to help Mickey and Scrooge.

TAG: Ursula_004_f
There's a sickness going around, and my potion would have healed them!

TAG: Ursula_006_f
That is a complete lie.

TAG: Ursula_005_f
... Well, it was worth a shot.
