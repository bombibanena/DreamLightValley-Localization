Olaf, I'd like to introduce you to someone.

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Have you met Jack Skelliâ

TAG: Olaf_002_f
*sigh* We've met.

TAG: Olaf_007_f
That's great!

TAG: Olaf_003_f
I have a trivia fact about the word "great"... but... never mind.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
You don't want to share a fun fact?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Olaf, what's wrong?!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
What happened to my cheerful friend Olaf?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
A snowman that's lost his excitement for trivia has lost his excitement for life!

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Umm...

TAG: Olaf_008_f
It was earlier today...

TAG: Olaf_009_f
Remy brought me some INCREDIBLE <Lore>Chocolate Ice Cream</Lore> that I wanted to give to Anna as a surprise for Best Friends Forever Day... which I invented this morning.

TAG: Olaf_010_f
And then... something disturbing happened.

TAG: Olaf_027_f
I may not be mature yet, but I think even someone mature would have been disturbed.

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Mr. Skellington kept saying "what's this?" and poking the ice cream with his bony fingers!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Ohh, that's terrible!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think he was just curious about it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I can't lie â that's kinda funny.

TAG: Olaf_013_f
Oh, thank goodness! I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks fingers don't belong in ice cream.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Thank you, I appreciate that, Olaf.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You're great.

TAG: Olaf_018_f
Don't worry, Olaf; I'll make you a fresh batch of <Lore>Chocolate Ice Cream</Lore>.

TAG: Olaf_019_f
And I'll have a word with Jack Skellington about barging into people's houses like that.

TAG: Olaf_020_f
Thank you! Oh, here! Have the recipe.

TAG: Olaf_028_f
And... {PlayerName}?

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Yes, Olaf?

TAG: Olaf_022_f
I could never keep a fun piece of trivia from you.

TAG: Olaf_023_f
Did you know that before it was a synonym for "excellent," "great" first meant "large"?

TAG: Olaf_024_f
I'll get right on making you some <ActivityItem>Chocolate Ice Cream</ActivityItem> so you have a Best Friends Forever Day surprise for Anna.

TAG: Olaf_025_f
In the modern sense, but also the old sense to refer to your great heart. I'll get right on making you some <ActivityItem>Chocolate Ice Cream</ActivityItem> so you have a Best Friends Forever Day surprise for Anna.

TAG: Olaf_014_f
Oh... But, {PlayerName}, I'm curious about lots of things, too...

TAG: Olaf_015_f
...and I try not to let my curiosity ruin other people's first-ever Best Friends Forever Day ice cream surprise.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
It is? But it ruined my surprise for Anna. Is this a kind of humor I'm not old enough to understand?

TAG: Olaf_017_f
No. It's not that. I guess it's just Jack Skellington being Jack Skellington.

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Well... Jack Skellington visited me.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
Oh, I could never lose my excitement for trivia.

TAG: Olaf_026_f
But I am having not-excited feelings...
