Olaf, I heard you were in trouble â are you all right?

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Oh {PlayerName}, I'm so glad you're here! It was horrible!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
It'll be OK; just tell me what happened. What did Jack's Dreamlight Day gift do?

TAG: Olaf_006_f
Well, there-there was a book...

TAG: Olaf_007_f
Go on...

TAG: Olaf_008_f
I opened it... and it was full... of trivia!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Keep going...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I thought you liked trivia!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
THE HORROR!

TAG: Olaf_009_f
But it wasn't just SOME trivia...

TAG: Olaf_021_f
Ooo, so maybe if I <Lore>take pictures of the trivia book</Lore>, it will lock up Jack's magic?

TAG: Olaf_022_f
Maybe! It's worth a try.

TAG: Olaf_023_f
Great, I'm on it!

TAG: Olaf_024_f
Oh, but it's not just one book, {PlayerName}. Somehow, the one book made more books!

TAG: Olaf_013_f
The book... it's filled with every piece of trivia in existence!

TAG: Olaf_014_f
I only read one page, and I could feel the knowledge pouring into my head.

TAG: Olaf_015_f
And I knew, if I read the whole book, I'd know all the trivia there is to know.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
So, I'd never again have the joy of learning a new fact!

TAG: Olaf_017_f
OK, now I get why you were so upset.

TAG: Olaf_018_f
Any idea how to deal with the trivia book?

TAG: Olaf_019_f
Well, there was one piece of trivia on that first page that might help...

TAG: Olaf_020_f
Did you know that some cultures think a camera is capable of capturing someone's spirit?

TAG: Olaf_010_f
I do! But what I like most is learning NEW trivia!

TAG: Olaf_011_f
Are you... making fun of me?

TAG: Olaf_012_f
I'm sorry, Olaf; please continue.
