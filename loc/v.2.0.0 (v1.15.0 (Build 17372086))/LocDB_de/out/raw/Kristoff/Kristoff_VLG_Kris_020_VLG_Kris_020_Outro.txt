You carved a Memory out of a <ActivityItem>Magic Ice Block</ActivityItem>? I have to see this.

TAG: Kristoff_000_f
Wow... The ice sculpture. When I looked at it, I remembered that Anna was... frozen.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
I thought she was gone. I was so sad.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
And then slowly... she was back. She'd saved Elsa. An act of true love thawed a broken heart.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
I don't think I've ever been so relieved.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
I don't remember everything. But my feelings for Anna... those are starting to come back.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Maybe feelings are more important than memories... What do you think?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Your love for Anna... that's what matters. Not all the little details.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Our feelings aren't worth much without the stories behind them.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Still... I'll keep trying to remember the rest. Now that I can feel my love for Anna, I've gotta remember everything!

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. You really came through for me.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
I'm... I'm grateful. And I know Anna will be too.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
They're worth a lot to me. But I'll keep trying to bring back the rest of my memories. Now that I can feel my love for Anna, I've gotta remember everything!
