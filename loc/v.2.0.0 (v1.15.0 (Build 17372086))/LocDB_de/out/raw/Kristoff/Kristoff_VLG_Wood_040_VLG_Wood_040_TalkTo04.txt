Hey, how's it going with the Carousel? I saw you made some repairs to it.

It's only missing one thing. There's an enchantment we need to do to turn on the lights.

Is there a childhood souvenir you have strong feelings about that you could share with Woody? I'm looking for...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...something magical.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...something iconic.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...something with reindeer, maybe?

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
I have something. It's not magical, exactly, but it's close enough.

Maybe you don't know this, but I was kinda raised by trolls...

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
They were great. A little pushy, but really nice. They made me feel like I was a part of their family.

So, I've got this little troll statue that I whittled to remember them by. I'm happy to let you borrow it to help Woody. Here you go.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
I don't know if it's iconic, but I may have something.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Actually, I've got an idea. And this may surprise you, but it's got nothing to do with reindeer.
