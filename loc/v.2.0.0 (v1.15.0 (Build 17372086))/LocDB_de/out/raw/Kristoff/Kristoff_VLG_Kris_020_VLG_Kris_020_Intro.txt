Hey, {PlayerName}, I've got kind of a strange problem. I could use some help.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Tell me everything.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'll help some other time.

TAG: Kristoff_000_f
Well, you remember that spell we did that took away my memories of Anna to help save the Village...?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Some of my memories are starting to come back, but not many of them. And I can tell it's breaking Anna's heart.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Have you ever forgotten something important?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I forgot an anniversary once.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think I forgot this Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Never.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
That's pretty bad. Hope you didn't get in too much trouble.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
If Anna and I have anniversaries, I don't even remember what they're for.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
Say... you don't remember Anna, but do you remember her sister, Elsa?

TAG: Kristoff_013_f
Huh. That's funny. I do remember Elsa!

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
But in all my memories of her, it's like... parts are foggy. I know someone else was with us. I just can't see who.

TAG: Kristoff_014_f
Maybe if you've still got memories of Elsa, and she's still got memories of you...

TAG: Kristoff_015_f
...she could help fill in what's missing from your memories with Anna. I'll go ask her.

TAG: Kristoff_016_f
It's worth a try, {PlayerName}. Thanks. Let me know if Elsa thinks of anything.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Oh. Wow. That's a pretty big thing to forget.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
You've never forgotten something important? You sure?

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Maybe you've forgotten what you've forgotten.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
Oh, sure. Don't worry. I don't think this problem's going away any time soon.
