Wow, {PlayerName}. These look amazing! They'll make a great addition to my <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>.

You know, after all that, Anna did some accounting for me, and it turns out I'm making enough money at the Stall to buy a whole new Sled. No payment plan needed.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
So, I'd like to give you my old <ActivityItem>Sled</ActivityItem> as thanks for repairing it and for everything.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
You've been really great, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
You saved my <ActivityItem>Sled</ActivityItem> and helped me start a new business.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
And now I can sell refined materials in my <ActivityItem>Stall</ActivityItem>. I really appreciate your help.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Oh, and you'll always have a discount there.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
If there's ever anything I can do to repay you, just let me know.
