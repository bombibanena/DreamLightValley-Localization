Oh hey! You're back... with a face made of stone...?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Whoa! Now I remember! Prince Eric! Of course!

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
That's not him, is it?! He didn't get turned to stone, did he?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
No. It's just a statue.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Uh... I hope not.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Don't even joke about that.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Phew! That's good. Where'd you find it?

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
I found it in the waters just off Dazzle Beach. It must have been on Eric's ship that sank.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Wait a second... it's all coming back to me now. Right after the storm, Donald and I scoured Dazzle Beach looking for anything that was on the ship.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
And now that I think about it... Eric was with us, helping us! I remember now!

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
So he made it out of the shipwreck!

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
Where did he go after that?

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Yeah!

TAG: Kristoff_013_f
It was all right before the Forgetting. Maybe some of the other Villagers would remember where he went if they saw the full statue.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
I kept the one piece we found and Donald has the others.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Think I used mine as a paperweight... What? It's heavy, and it holds down papers. It's all yours if you can find it. It's somewhere in my House.

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
No idea.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Yeah, me too. So, where'd that come from?

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
I wasn't! There's so much magic around here, you never know. So, where'd you find that thing?
