{PlayerName}, what's going on? There's all this Dark Magic everywhere. I barely managed to fight it off!

TAG: Player_000_f
It's a curse that Mother Gothel whipped up.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I need your help to break it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I need you to make a sacrifice.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You don't REALLY need your memories of Anna... right?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
I'll do anything! Tell me what you need.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
I need you to agree to give up your love for Anna... All your memories of her.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
What...? That's crazy. Anna's everything to me.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
I'll never give up my memories of her!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It's the only hope we have.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You'll get to fall in love with her all over again!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Fine. I can't make you do this.

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
Which means it's the only hope Anna has, too. *sigh* I guess I don't have a choice.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
If it's the only way to save the Valley, I'll do it.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
The love I have for Anna and her love for me will survive anything.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
I trust you to help me get my memories back.

TAG: Kristoff_016_f
But for now... I'll give them up.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
I guess that's true. We'll have those warm fluttery feelings again â the ones you get when you first fall in love. And this will help Anna, too, right? Well...

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
*sigh* ... {PlayerName}, wait! If it's the only way to save the Valley, that means it's the only way to save Anna... I'll do it.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Anything... Just tell me what.
