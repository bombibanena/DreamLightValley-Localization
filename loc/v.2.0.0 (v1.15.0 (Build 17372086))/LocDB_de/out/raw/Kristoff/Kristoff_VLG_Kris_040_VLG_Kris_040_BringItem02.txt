The patch is solid. Let me check the runners... Great! My <ActivityItem>Sled</ActivityItem> is fixed!

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
This is some nice work. How'd you do it?

TAG: Player_000_f
I just used some refined materials. It was...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
All written in the book.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Too technical for you.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
That's good to hear.

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
You know, I'd like to sell some of those refined materials you used in my Stall. I'm sure people need them.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Could you bring me samples of everything you used so I know what to stock?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Love this idea! Doing it right now.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Anything for the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
If you sell them, I won't have to constantly forage. YES.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Told you it'd be useful!

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Yeah, well, I'd like to see you harvest a lake full of ice without falling in.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
You're right. I would have no idea how to do that.
