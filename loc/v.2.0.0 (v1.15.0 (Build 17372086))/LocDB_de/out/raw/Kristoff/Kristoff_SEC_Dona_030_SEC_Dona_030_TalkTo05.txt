Hey, {PlayerName}. Wait, is that a sock?

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
I found it lying on the ground. It's orange, so I figured it might be yours.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
You know... since you really like carrots.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Sorry, no. That's not my sock.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
And that's not really carrot-orange, is it? Looks more like pumpkin-orange to me.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
Pumpkins are more of a Fairy Godmother thing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You can see how I'd make that mistake.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Whoops. Sorry. My bad.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Oh, right. They're subtly but noticeably different shades of orange.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Wait a second. That's not my sock, but now that I look more closely, I think I've seen it before.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
Socks like that were hanging up on a clothesline <Lore>near Merlin's library</Lore>.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Hmm... <Lore>who would be hanging up their laundry there</Lore>? I guess I'll go check.
