That looks like one of Donald's feathers! I hope nothing happened to him.

The portal leads to a Dark Grove.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The Dark Grove is full of mist.

How can we find Donald?

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
A <Lore>Dark Grove</Lore>? That sounds like the Valley's Forest... but darker? What could that place be?

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Okay, there's no way you're getting through that thick mist without something to help lead you to Donald. It's too dangerous. You'll get lost. Trust me... Been there, done that.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
You should <Lore>bring the feather you found to Merlin</Lore>. Maybe he knows some kind of magic that'll help you track Donald in that Dark Grove.
