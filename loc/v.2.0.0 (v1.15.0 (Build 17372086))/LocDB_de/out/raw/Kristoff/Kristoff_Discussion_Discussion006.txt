{PlayerName}. Do you think the magic here is strange?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Very strange.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I think it's more magical.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm starting to think of it as normal.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Yes! Thank you!

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
This isn't the kind of magic I'm used to. Some things here just don't make sense to me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Yeah. Me neither.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Is it different from the trolls' magic?

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Is it like Elsa's magic?

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
Phew! I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
Totally different! They're love experts and never confuse things or make you lose your memory.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
No. Elsa's magic is ice and snow. Pretty useful stuff, actually, speaking as an ice expert.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Right... because it's magic. But the magical stuff I've seen here is definitely strange.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Really? Huh. Because the magical stuff I've seen here is definitely strange.
