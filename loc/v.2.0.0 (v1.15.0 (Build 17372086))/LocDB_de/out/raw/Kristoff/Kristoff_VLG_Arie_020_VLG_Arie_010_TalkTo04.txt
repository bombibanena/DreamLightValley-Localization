A prince with dark hair? Huh. Now that you mention it...

I do remember somebody like that. But it's kinda fuzzy.

I used to help some guy with his expeditions out at sea. He'd find rare Valley artifacts, and I'd help him take them off his ship and preserve and archive them.

Maybe that was this Eric guy?

You know, I might still have some records of his expeditions at my House!

I've gotta get some stuff for Donald, but if you go look around in there, you can probably find them. Maybe I wrote down where Prince Eric went.
