Hey, great looking <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>, {PlayerName}! Nice work.

Okay, the next Ingredient we need for <ActivityItem>Soap</ActivityItem> is <ActivityItem>Oil</ActivityItem>. I usually use <ActivityItem>Carrot</ActivityItem> oil.

Sure you could do that... but why not mix it up? Let's add something else. Maui has pretty great hair. We could find out what he uses.

I'll ask him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
My guess... it must have something to do with <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He loves to talk about himself, so it'll be easy to get the info.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Thanks!

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
That makes sense, but I don't know anything about coconuts. You might wanna ask him to be sure.

Yeah... Maui isn't exactly shy, is he?
