Hey, {PlayerName}, sorry to bother you. Do you have time to help me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Sure, tell me what happened.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
I'm busy, sorry!

I was in the Frosted Heights looking for materials the other day...

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
And I ran into a deep drift. Now my <ActivityItem>Sled</ActivityItem> is stuck in the ice.

TAG: Kristoff_000_f
I've tried everything, but I can't get it out. Think you could work your magic and free it?

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
I'll take care of this...

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I love to help others.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Did this ever happen in Arendelle?

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
Maybe I should revoke your sled-driving license...

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
Thanks!

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
I'll show you where my <ActivityItem>Sled</ActivityItem> is stuck.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Sometimes. But usually I could get it out myself.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
I don't think a sled-driving license is a thing.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Oh, that's okay. I'll try to figure something out.
