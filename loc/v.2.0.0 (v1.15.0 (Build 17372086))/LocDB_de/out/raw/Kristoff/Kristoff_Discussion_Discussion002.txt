I'm hoping you can settle something for me...

What would you think if someone told you they'd gotten engaged to someone they'd just met that day?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Terrible idea.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
True love!

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Exactly! The first day you meet someone, they're practically a stranger! Thanks. I was pretty sure I wasn't alone in thinking that.

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
What?! You can't really get to know someone in just one day.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
What if he's secretly plotting to steal your kingdom? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a good point.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Doesn't matter. True love.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Ew.

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
It is a good point! Thank you.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
No. I'm sorry. You can't just say "true love" like it answers all the questions!

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
All men do it. Sorry.
