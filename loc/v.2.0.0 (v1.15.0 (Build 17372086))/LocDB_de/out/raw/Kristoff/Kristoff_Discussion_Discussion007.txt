Ugh. Working in the rain is definitely not my favorite thing.

Tell me about it.

Isn't snow worse than rain?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Except for working in sleet.

You get wet, which means you're cold. And rain turns everything muddy. And if it gets colder, your wet gear freezes!

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
Which is dangerous because frozen gear is hard to use and breaks easily... Did I mention I don't like working in the rain?

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
No. Snow is much better than rain. Snow you can just shake off. Snow just makes things cold. And I like the cold... When it's dry.

You're right. Sleet is definitely worse than rain.
