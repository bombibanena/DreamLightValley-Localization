So, I was thinking of climbing an icy mountain today.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
That sounds fun.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
That sounds dangerous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Why?

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
It is fun. And I like the feeling of accomplishment when I get to the top of a tall mountain.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
I can't wait to look down and see the whole Valley in one glance.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That sounds beautiful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I bet you'll enjoy that.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Don't slip!

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
I'm sure it will be. Sights like that really make you understand your place in the world.

TAG: Kristoff_006_f
I will. I bet it's gonna be incredible.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
Don't worry. I'm an expert. I'll be fine.

TAG: Kristoff_002_f
It can be, but I've been climbing mountains my whole life.

Why does anyone climb a mountain? To get to the top.
