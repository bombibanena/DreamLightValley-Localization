Hey, {PlayerName}. Good to see you. What's up?

TAG: Kristoff_008_f
Woody and I are trying to fix his Carousel, and we could use your help to figure out where to start.

TAG: Kristoff_001_f
I'd be happy to help.

TAG: Kristoff_004_f
Actually, I'm kinda glad you came to me. I've seen how worn down the Carousel looks, and I wanted to do something but...

TAG: Kristoff_005_f
I didn't exactly know how to approach it.

TAG: Kristoff_007_f
It would've been a little odd for me to just show up with a bunch of planks and nails...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It would have been a nice gesture.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Is that what we need?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Eh, it beats bringing flowers, in my opinion...

TAG: Kristoff_009_f
I guess, but a lot of people might take it the wrong way.

TAG: Kristoff_014_f
Anyway, I've had some time to think about how I'd fix the Carousel, and you're gonna need a <ActivityItem>Repair Kit</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_015_f
You can make 'em for everything nowadays. Boats, sleds, why not a Carousel?

TAG: Kristoff_003_f
Okay, I'm listening...

TAG: Kristoff_012_f
I jotted down a few ideas. You'll see; it's pretty simple. If you gather these materials, you should be able to craft the <ActivityItem>Carousel Repair Kit</ActivityItem> in no time.

TAG: Kristoff_010_f
Not exactly. I've had some time to think about how I'd fix the Carousel, and you're gonna need a <ActivityItem>Repair Kit</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Kristoff_011_f
Exactly. See, you get it.
