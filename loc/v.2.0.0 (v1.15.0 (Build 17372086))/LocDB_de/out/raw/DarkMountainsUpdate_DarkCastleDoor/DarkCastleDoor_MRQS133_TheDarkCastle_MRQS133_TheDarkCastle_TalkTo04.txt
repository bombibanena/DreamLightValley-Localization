Hello, door! It's me again! The Forgotten!

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_001_f
As you can see... I look very Forgotten-y now! So... I guess you'll be opening for me, right?

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_002_f
Hrm... hrm... you do look more like my creator now... as they once appeared, long ago...

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_003_f
Though... something about you still doesn't seem quite right...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
You must have dust in your keyhole. It's really me!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I did get a haircut recently...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do you dare risk my wrath if you're wrong?

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_004_f
Yes... yes, I suppose that might be so...

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_008_f
Of course, there are challenges and dangers in this Castle much greater than me.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_009_f
If you're trying to deceive... if you're not my creator... then you'll surely fail to pass through one of the next doors.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_007_f
But for now... I shall swing open and let you proceed.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_005_f
Yes... yes... perhaps that's it.

TAG: DarkCastleDoor_006_f
I suppose that's fair. I do not wish to displease Your Highness.
