Reporting in with some more scans, EVE! There's nothing to fear on Eternity Isle.

TAG: EVE_001_f
That misplaced boat in the Wild Tangle is completely secure â no danger of falling!

TAG: EVE_002_f
And those snakes in the Glittering Dunes â they're actually kind of cuddly!

TAG: EVE_003_f
As for that fella with the thick neck...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
He's mostly harmless.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
He's a friend. Don't worry.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
He's more annoying than dangerous.

TAG: EVE_004_f
Hmm...

TAG: EVE_005_f
... Oh. Phew.

TAG: EVE_006_f
You don't have to worry about dangers anymore.

TAG: EVE_007_f
This is your home. You're safe here. Promise.

TAG: EVE_008_f
