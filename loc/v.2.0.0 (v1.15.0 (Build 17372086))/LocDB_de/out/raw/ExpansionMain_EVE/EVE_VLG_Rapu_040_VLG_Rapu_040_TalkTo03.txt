Hey, EVE... You haven't done anything with your canvas yet. Do you need some help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Your blaster is powerful!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You made a "hole" new piece.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Looks like you had a blast.

TAG: EVE_002_f
Directive?

TAG: EVE_003_f
You don't have to use paint or brushes you know. You can make art however you want.

TAG: EVE_004_f
EVE?

TAG: EVE_005_f
*giggle*

TAG: EVE_001_f
Ha!

TAG: EVE_006_f
Wow. EVE, you just made a smoking hole in the canvas with your blaster arm... That's ART.

TAG: EVE_008_f
Whoo-hoo!

TAG: EVE_013_f
You're welcome? I think?

TAG: EVE_007_f
Huh?

TAG: EVE_012_f
Nice work, EVE!

TAG: EVE_009_f
Huh?

TAG: EVE_010_f
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

TAG: EVE_011_f
Directive?
