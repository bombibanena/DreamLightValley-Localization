Hey {PlayerName}! Any chance you could help me out? I have this idea... Hearing my story might help others who get into similar situations. But I need advice on how to get started.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'd love to help you out!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm a bit too busy right now.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Excellent! I think a lot of folks could benefit if I share my story with the world.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's a great idea!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you sure that's wise?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You really crave attention, don't you?

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Of course it is!

TAG: Flynn_009_f
What did you have in mind?

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Well, actually... I was hoping you might have a brilliant idea?

TAG: Flynn_012_f
What if we gather your stories and write a book?

TAG: Flynn_013_f
That's PERFECT! Curses, love, adventure! It'll be like "The Tales of Flynnagan Rider"!

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
The what of who?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
That's a book, right?

TAG: Flynn_001_f
It's a book I read as a kid. Flynnagan Rider was my hero.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
If you write a book, you'll be the hero of someone else's childhood!

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Ooh, I like that!

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Although... I'm not sure I have what it takes to be a writer.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
So we get you a ghost writer. You tell them your story and they do the actual writing part!

TAG: Flynn_016_f
{PlayerName}, you're a genius! Now tell me â who would make a great ghost writer?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Belle?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Merlin?

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Donald?

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Of course! She'd be perfect.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
Do you think she'd want to write for me?

TAG: Flynn_021_f
I think so! Let's <Lore>go find Belle</Lore> and ask her!

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Oh, but he's so busy. I don't think he'll have time.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
In that case, I think Belle is our best bet. She LOVES books!

TAG: Flynn_019_f
I don't know. If we disagree about anything, I worry that he might storm off.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Yep! Flynnagan Rider was my hero!

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Crave? No. Deserve? I'd like to think so. But this isn't about me. Not really.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Okay, that is not a problem. Come back when you have more time!
