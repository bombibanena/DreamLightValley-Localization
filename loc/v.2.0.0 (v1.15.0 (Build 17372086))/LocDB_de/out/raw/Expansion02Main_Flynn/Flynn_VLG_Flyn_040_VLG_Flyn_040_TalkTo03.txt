Hey Flynn, how do you like the pictures we took?

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Well... they're very good, but I'm not sure they properly capture my likeness.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
No one can ever get my nose right!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
They're pictures taken with a camera. It's impossible that they didn't get your nose right.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
If you say so...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
So do you like them or not?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
The camera never lies.

Maybe you need to work on your self-perception.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Sure. They're much better than the previous sketches I've seen of myself. You did a great job!

TAG: Flynn_009_f
I think I'm just nervous.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
You have nothing to be nervous about. This is going to be great!

I know Belle was going to send her manuscript to some publishers. I'll go <Lore>check the mail</Lore> and see if there are any updates.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
I'm used to painted portraits, not... whatever that thing is.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
But, you're right. Those images did come out great! You did a fantastic job.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Hey! My self-perception is great!

TAG: Flynn_011_f
I perceive my self-perception to be... perfectly... perceptive.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
What?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Sorry, sorry.
