Flynn? Are you okay?

TAG: Flynn_001_f
It's starting to come back... I remember...

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Me... kneeling at Maleficent's feet?

TAG: Flynn_003_f
No way. This can't be real. I'd never help her.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe it's not what it seems.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You're overreacting.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
If you can think of a way to prove these memories are false, that would be great.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Listen, I have an idea. It might sound a little out there, but...

TAG: Flynn_009_f
What if I talk to Ursula?

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Ursula?! It's bad enough that I'm tangled up with Maleficent. You want to make a deal with the Sea Witch, too?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
She might have a potion that can help.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe she has villainous intel to share.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
She could help us think outside the box.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Potions are her specialty, after all.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Funny, I would have said her specialties are "lying" and "dirty dealing."

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Dirty dealing maybe, but despite her, ah, flaws... Ursula isn't usually an outright liar.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
She might be able to help you recover your memories.

TAG: Flynn_021_f
Well...

TAG: Flynn_022_f
All right. Let's <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>... If you really think it's a good idea.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
If she's heard anything, she might be willing to share that information.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
With Ursula, that sort of thing always comes with a price.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
It might be worth it, though.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
Seeing things from another perspective might help.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Sure, but I mean... Ursula?!

TAG: Flynn_019_f
With her knowledge of villainy, she could lead us in the right direction.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Maybe... or maybe it is. UGH! I'm so confused!

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Am I? Because I think you may be underreacting.
