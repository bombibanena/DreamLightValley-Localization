No! ... Maybe... Let's say "concerned." Here's the thing: I haven't met Rapunzel's mother, but I know she's around here.

TAG: Flynn_001_f
And I've been thinking about the whole "locked in a tower" situation, and I was wondering...

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Do you know Rapunzel's mother? What do you think of her?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
She's great!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
She's manipulative.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
You'll have to meet her for yourself.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Really? Huh. I guess that's reassuring. Maybe I've been getting the wrong impression.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
I mean, how bad can it be to lock your daughter away from the world to keep her SAFE?

TAG: Flynn_005_f
You know what? I didn't like that even as I was saying it. It's just bad from top to bottom.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
That's what I've been thinking! I mean, c'mon! Scaring Rapunzel just to keep her inside?

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Before you say anything, I did try to scare Rapunzel, too. But that was just once! And I deeply regret it.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
You scared Rapunzel?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
But you learned better.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
I wanted to get her back to her tower. And she'd said her mother scared her with stories about ruffians and thugs... So I introduced her to a few.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Then she goes and tells them about her dreams. And I found out they like to bake and collect ceramic unicorns...

TAG: Flynn_010_f
She's amazing... She changed my life.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Yeah. I have... Thanks to Rapunzel. She's amazing.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Keeping me in suspense. Nice.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Mother Gothel is hard to explain.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
You'll understand immediately.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
"Hard to explain"?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
I really don't like the sound of that...

TAG: Flynn_015_f
I hope you mean "you'll understand where Rapunzel gets her kind heart and joy for life from," but...

TAG: Flynn_016_f
...something tells me you don't.
