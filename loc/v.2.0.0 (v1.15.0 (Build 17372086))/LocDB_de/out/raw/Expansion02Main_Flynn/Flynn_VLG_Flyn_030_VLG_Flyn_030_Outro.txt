Flynn! I found these pages... Looks like they were torn from a journal or something.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Wait... I remember these! I think Aurora sent them to me!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
This is proof you and Aurora were actually working together!

TAG: Flynn_010_f
I was helping her...?

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Yeah! You were working TOGETHER on a plan to trick Maleficent and get inside her castle.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
So, I'm innocent?

TAG: Flynn_025_f
Not just innocent... you're a hero! You must have been trying to help Aurora with her plan to stop the Neverafter.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Wow! I guess it was a good thing we broke in here then, huh?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Definitely!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not so sure about THAT.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We could have found the journal another way.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
We proved you're not guilty of anything.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Plus, we had ourselves a little adventure and a little excitement along the way.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
That too.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
There's actually something else, {PlayerName}. Iâ OH!

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Something came back to me before, but I couldn't make sense of it until now.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Maleficent cursed me because she caught me working with Aurora.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
She was angry with me. She thought I'd work for her, and instead I helped Aurora hide. She cursed me as a punishment.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That explains a lot.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Seems like a harsh punishment.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That's very typical of Maleficent.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
It does. Man, it is nice to know I was doing the right thing all along.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
So now what? What new adventure awaits Flynn Rider?

TAG: Flynn_023_f
I've got a few ideas percolating. I'll let you know. And hey, thanks for all your help with this. I finally feel like myself again!

TAG: Flynn_024_f
Any time, Flynn.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
It's Maleficent, what do you expect?

TAG: Flynn_021_f
She does love a good curse.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Come on, you had fun; admit it!

TAG: Flynn_012_f
I guess it was pretty exciting.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Sure. Right. We could have just asked Maleficent nicely.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Okay, maybe not.
