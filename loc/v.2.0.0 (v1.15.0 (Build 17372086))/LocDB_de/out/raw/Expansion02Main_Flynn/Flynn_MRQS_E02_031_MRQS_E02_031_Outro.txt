Wow, {PlayerName}. I saw that House you built for me and...

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Well... thanks. It's not often that I've had a place that nice to call home.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Not that I'm getting emotional, mind you. I've got a reputation to protect.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What is that reputation?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You're welcome. It was no problem, really.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
You're totally getting emotional.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
You know. Flynn Rider. Swashbuckling rogue!

TAG: Flynn_016_f
Anyway, now that I'm out of there... if there's anything you need to help fight the Neverafter? Just name it.

TAG: Flynn_024_f
I guess next I'll need to find <Lore>more Fairy Tale Trials</Lore> just like this one.

TAG: Flynn_025_f
Each one I fix gets me <Lore>one step closer to Maleficent</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_026_f
If you find more of them, let me know. I'm pretty great at exploring dungeons, plundering treasures, charming old widows into sharing their fortunes...

TAG: Flynn_027_f
You know. Charming adventurer stuff.

TAG: Flynn_023_f
In the meantime, though, I've got some unfinished business to take care of.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
I don't suppose you've seen a girl anywhere, about this tall...

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Very, VERY long blonde hair...

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Killer swing with a frying pan?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Are you talking about Rapunzel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Doesn't ring a bell, sorry.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
You know Rapunzel?!

TAG: Flynn_007_f
I found her on Eternity Isle.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Then that's where I'm going! We need to talk afterâ

TAG: Flynn_009_f
No, wait. I can't face Rapunzel. Not yet.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
When I see her again, I want to be the man she deserves.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Maleficent's curse is still hanging over me.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
I'm feeling a sudden urge to form a pack and chase down an elk.

TAG: Flynn_021_f
I hope this goes away soon. But if not... well, I might need some more help. Check back with me later, would you?

TAG: Flynn_006_f
I've got to find her. She must be somewhere out there.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
There's someone I need to find and catch up with. A certain blonde with very, VERY long hair and a killer swing with a frying pan.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
But before I do that...

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Well, hey, I appreciate it. I'm a pretty good friend to have, you know.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
I am not!

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Okay... maybe JUST a little.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Don't tell anyone. Swashbuckling rogues don't get emotional.
