It's all coming back now... I captured Aurora, and I delivered her right to Maleficent. It WAS me.

Flynn, this can't be the whole truth. Something else is going on here.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
I know it is. I would never work for Maleficent. And I would never do her bidding. And I'd especially never betray Princess Aurora!

TAG: Flynn_003_f
I must have been under a curse, or... or maybe Maleficent tricked me, or threatened me. Or maybe none of this is real.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
We'll get to the bottom of this. Don't worry.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
I know we will. I'm gonna find out what happened to Princess Aurora... and fix whatever Maleficent made me do! I promise.
