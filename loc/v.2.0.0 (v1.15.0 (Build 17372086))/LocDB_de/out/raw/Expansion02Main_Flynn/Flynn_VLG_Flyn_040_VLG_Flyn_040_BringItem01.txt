Okay Flynn, so the good news is we have two Villagers who are interested in your book! Scrooge McDuck and Goofy.

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Fantastic! Those two know a good thing when they see it, don't they?

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Yes, but we have to remember that with each choice comes compromise. If you ask me, I think you should go with...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...Scrooge McDuck.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...Goofy.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Mr. McDuck would definitely know how to make money marketing you.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
True. And I do want to sell a lot of books, but...

TAG: Flynn_006_f
This isn't supposed to be about me. Not really.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
This is a tough one, {PlayerName}. Neither feels QUITE right.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
There is a third option... You could always self-publish.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Be your own boss!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
You'd have total control.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Easier than choosing between two friends!

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Why didn't you say so earlier? That's perfect!

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Great choice! And to kick things off, we should organize a book signing.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
I'll <Lore>purchase supplies</Lore> to set everything up. You take this time to get ready.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Goofy is so loveable. He would add personality to your brand.

TAG: Flynn_007_f
That's true. And I really like Goofy! He's a nice guy, but...

TAG: Flynn_008_f
I worry he might get distracted, and that could impact sales.
