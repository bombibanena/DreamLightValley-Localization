SO many adventures. Shall I tell you about one of my astounding (and absolutely true) exploits?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, I love stories!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Hm, no thanks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Are they REALLY true stories?

TAG: Flynn_001_f
I thought you might. Now, what kind of story do you want to hear?

TAG: Flynn_002_f
A daring escape, a high seas adventure...

TAG: Flynn_003_f
And, oh... there's the time I climbed a tower and met a girl with the LONGEST hair in the kingdom.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Daring escape.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
High seas.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Your Rapunzel story!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Good choice. So, after a misunderstanding with the local authorities...

TAG: Flynn_013_f
And I landed in a passing pirate ship below! (Talk about timing, right?)

TAG: Flynn_005_f
...I had landed myself briefly in a famous prison.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
There were only three ways to get in or out...

TAG: Flynn_007_f
...two heavily guarded gates and a dangerous path down the side of the mountain.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Obviously, I chose the most daring escape route possible.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
So after stealing a key and sneaking out of my cell...

TAG: Flynn_010_f
...I found myself climbing down a narrow mountain trail, blasted by high winds, pursued by guards...

TAG: Flynn_011_f
...and inches away from falling to my doom.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Then, just as the guards were about to catch me, I jumped off the side of the mountain!

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Well, this takes place JUST after my daring escape story.

TAG: Flynn_023_f
I disembarked when they reached port not too far from where I grew up.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
There I was: on the deck of a pirate ship, surrounded by the scurviest bunch of buccaneers you've ever seen.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
They were a little surprised to see me, as I hadn't exactly asked to come aboard.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Rather, I'd jumped off a cliff right onto their ship.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
I'm not gonna lie. There were a few tense moments.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
But I quickly won them over with my natural charm and the story of my prison break!

TAG: Flynn_020_f
The pirate captain was so impressed, he appointed me official storyteller of the ship.

TAG: Flynn_021_f
It turns out that being at sea for months is dreadfully boring. Just a lot of water and not much else.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
These guys were desperate for entertainment. And I had stories. So it worked out.

TAG: Flynn_024_f
Okay, so there was this crown, right? For the lost princess... And it was just sitting and gathering dust.

TAG: Flynn_025_f
So, myself and two of my â ahem â colleagues, the Stabbington Brothers, decided that crown belonged in our hands.

TAG: Flynn_026_f
Then I decided it REALLY belonged in MY hands. As soon as we got the crown, I made a break for it.

TAG: Flynn_027_f
Soon, I found myself running through the forest, trying to find a safe place to hide when I stumbled upon this tower.

TAG: Flynn_028_f
I climb it. And inside, there's this... young woman. Long blonde hair. Big green eyes. Killer swing with a frying pan...

TAG: Flynn_029_f
After the frying pan incident, I found out she'd hidden the crown. She said she'd give it to me once I took her to see the floating lights that always showed up in the sky on her birthday...

TAG: Flynn_030_f
And THAT was the beginning of what I think is the biggest adventure of my life.

TAG: Flynn_031_f
Even I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out.

TAG: Flynn_032_f
Suit yourself.

TAG: Flynn_033_f
I guess some people can't appreciate a good story.

TAG: Flynn_034_f
Let me know if you change your mind.

TAG: Flynn_035_f
Of course! Would *I* make up stories just to impress people?

TAG: Flynn_036_f
Don't answer that. How about a story?
