Okay... This place is... different.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
I wonder what's up with that <Lore>big empty table</Lore>.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Maybe we need to place the chairs around it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe there's supposed to be food on it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Maybe we're supposed to build a pillow fort under it?

TAG: Flynn_009_f
That would make sense. Tables, chairs â they go together.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
And what do you think's up with that <Lore>clock on the wall</Lore> over there?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Maybe we need to move the hands?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe we should smash it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe it's ticking down to our doom?

TAG: Flynn_005_f
I say you give it a try!

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Maybe you should <Lore>look for some instructions around here</Lore>. There has to be something!

TAG: Flynn_006_f
Take it from someone who's, shall we say, entered a few spaces uninvited â smashing's an amateur move. Makes a lot of noise, gets glass everywhere...

TAG: Flynn_007_f
That would be exciting. But I don't think it's THAT kind of clock. The hands don't seem to be moving at all.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
"Supposed to"? I don't know. But "should"? Definitely! Or else it's a waste of a perfectly good table.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
I somehow doubt that, not least because I don't see any pillows here.
