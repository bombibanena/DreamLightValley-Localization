{PlayerName}, I'm glad you're here! I could use your help with a very legitimate, yet excitingly furtive mission that I'm planning.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You have my attention... How can I help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I think I'll pass for now.

TAG: Flynn_001_f
I've been thinking of ways to fix whatever I did and find out what happened to Princess Aurora.

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Sounds good to me.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
And I came up with a plan that's a Flynn Rider classic.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Oh boy.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
It involves Maleficent.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Do you want to team up with her?!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I hope it involves avoiding her completely.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm afraid to ask...

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Of course not! Quite the opposite, in fact.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Okay, I'm in.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I don't know...

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
This is a BAD idea.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
And what does that mean?

TAG: Flynn_015_f
Remember how I told you that Maleficent cursed me because she wanted me to guard something?

TAG: Flynn_017_f
Right! Did you remember what it was?

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Yes! It was a vault, where she kept things that were important to her.

TAG: Flynn_019_f
I say we get into that vault. There's bound to be some clue about Aurora in there. And if we happen to find some treasures along the way... well, they probably didn't belong to Maleficent in the first place, right?

TAG: Flynn_021_f
What do you think? You in for a daring and dashing heist?

TAG: Flynn_022_f
And you really think this will help you?

TAG: Flynn_023_f
I really, really do.

TAG: Flynn_025_f
YES! That is great!

TAG: Flynn_024_f
What do we need to do first?

TAG: Flynn_026_f
So the vault is blocked and unreachable right now. We need to clear the path so we can get in. Come with me; I'll show you!

TAG: Flynn_020_f
Seems pretty risky.

TAG: Flynn_029_f
Please, {PlayerName}. Don't make me break out the puppy eyes; they're worse than the smolder.

TAG: Flynn_030_f
Okay, if it means THAT much to you... I'll do it.

TAG: Flynn_027_f
Sometimes the best things come from bad ideas!

TAG: Flynn_028_f
I don't think that's true...

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Mmm, not quite avoiding. More like... actively robbing.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
That sounds... bad.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Trust me; it's gonna be great.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Don't be! I have everything under control.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
Somehow, I'm not convinced.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Have a little faith in me, will ya?

TAG: Flynn_002_f
Suit yourself. I'll fill you in on it later.
