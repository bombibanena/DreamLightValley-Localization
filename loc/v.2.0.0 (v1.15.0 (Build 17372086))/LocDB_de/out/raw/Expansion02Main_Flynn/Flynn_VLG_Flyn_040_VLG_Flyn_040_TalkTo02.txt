Okay Flynn, if we're going to get people to buy your book, we need to market you properly.

TAG: Flynn_001_f
Oh, that won't be a problem. Let's just say, I've never had a problem attracting fans.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, you're very handsome.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It's not just about looks.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't understand.

AND I have a winning personality!

The people will want to see an everyman, someone down-to-earth, someone they can RELATE to.

You're telling the story of Flynn Rider, but people want to get to know Eugene Fitzherbert.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Okay, okay. I'm following you so far... Just tell me what to do.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
We'll start by <Lore>taking some pictures of you</Lore> around the Valley, showcasing you in everyday scenarios. It's like a high-speed painting. Or an instant wanted poster!

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Works for me, so long as you get my good side.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
AND get my nose right!

TAG: Flynn_003_f
I know. I have a winning personality too!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Because I'm a handsome guy...?

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Sure, but this is about more than just that!
