You found a magnet behind the target?

TAG: Flynn_004_f
That's strange. I DEFINITELY didn't sneak down here to place that before the competition started.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Flynn. Come on. That's a dirty trick.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
If you didn't do it, who did?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It's kind of funny, honestly.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
Fiiine, you're right. MAYBE I asked around about a way that I could throw off her shot.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
But Merida got me first with those wanted posters. I was just returning the favor.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Classic Flynn.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It was all in good fun.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'm beginning to see why Merida finds you so annoying.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Exactly!

TAG: Flynn_013_f
I guess this means I'm disqualified from the competition, huh?

TAG: Flynn_014_f
That's too bad. I was just about to pull off the amazing, one-in-a-million Flynn Rider Trick Shot.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
What's that?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Sounds extremely made up.

TAG: Flynn_015_f
It's a little move where I throw three apples into the air...

TAG: Flynn_017_f
...then shoot an arrow from behind my back and spear all three before curving my arrow directly into the bullseye.

TAG: Flynn_018_f
It's too bad you and Merida will never get to see it. Tragic, really.

TAG: Flynn_000_f
Better go tell her she won!

TAG: Flynn_016_f
Oh, it's real. And I can definitely make it.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
Well, I thought so, anyway.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
But still charming, right? ... Right?! *sigh*

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Okay, okay, it was me. I maybe asked around about a way that I could throw off her shot.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Right?! I mean, sure, it's a little underhanded. But I just asked around about a way to throw off her shot.
