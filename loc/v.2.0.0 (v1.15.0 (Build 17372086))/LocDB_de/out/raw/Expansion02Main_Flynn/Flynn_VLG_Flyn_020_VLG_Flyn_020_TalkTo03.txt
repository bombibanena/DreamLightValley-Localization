Flynn... how are you feeling? What do you remember?

TAG: Flynn_015_f
It's Aurora! She's the princess from my nightmares. Maleficent wanted someone to find her... and I went to do it.

TAG: Flynn_022_f
But you were cursed! It isn't your fault!

TAG: Flynn_023_f
This was before Maleficent cursed me. I'm sure of that. There's something else going on here...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
This isn't you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I know it looks bad...

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
We need more information.

TAG: Flynn_002_f
There's another explanation; I just know it.

TAG: Flynn_021_f
Its probably best if you lay low and maybe try to relax. I'll <Lore>talk to Hades</Lore> and report back.

TAG: Flynn_005_f
There has to be.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
I would never work with Maleficent, especially not to find Aurora for her!

TAG: Flynn_007_f
There's more to this Memory, isn't there?

TAG: Flynn_016_f
We can figure this out.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
What else can you remember now?

TAG: Flynn_018_f
I think I was in Mythopia looking at that poster...

TAG: Flynn_019_f
Maybe Hades knows more!

TAG: Flynn_003_f
Things might feel a little dire right now...

TAG: Flynn_008_f
Dire? This isn't dire. It's confusing.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
I would never work with Maleficent, especially not to find Aurora for her!

TAG: Flynn_004_f
We still haven't recovered your full memories.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Who knows what else you've repressed?

TAG: Flynn_013_f
There's gotta be some explanation. I would never work with Maleficent, especially not to find Aurora for her!
