That last Fairy Tale Trial... It was kind of incredible to live out one of those adventures I read as a kid.

You're a cooler hero than any hero from a story, Flynn.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Nobody's as cool as the heroes in stories.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm way cooler than the hero in any story.

TAG: Flynn_004_f
Really...? You think so?

TAG: Flynn_018_f
Uh... I mean, of course I am!

TAG: Flynn_019_f
... Thanks, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Flynn_006_f
In any case, I did some scouting, and it looks like that beanstalk to Maleficent's castle just grew some more!

TAG: Flynn_007_f
Which means it's long enough now for us to <Lore>climb it</Lore> to get into Maleficent's castle.

TAG: Flynn_008_f
You already cleared all the ink blocking the way.

TAG: Flynn_009_f
Guess all that's left to do is head inside and... well... <Lore>confront Maleficent</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_010_f
Whatever happens... I'm with you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Flynn_011_f
But first, you'll have to clear all that ink blocking the way.

TAG: Flynn_012_f
Once you do that, there won't be anything stopping you from <Lore>confronting Maleficent</Lore>.

TAG: Flynn_013_f
It looks like we still have to <Lore>find one more Fairy Tale Trial</Lore> before we can climb all the way up.

TAG: Flynn_014_f
Maybe we could <Lore>look into the Teapot Falls</Lore> to the east?

TAG: Flynn_015_f
You'll have to <Lore>clear away all the ink</Lore> around the place first, though.

TAG: Flynn_016_f
You already cleared away the ink blocking <Lore>Teapot Falls</Lore>. Let's go look around there for the Fairy Tale Trial.

TAG: Flynn_017_f
I don't know, {PlayerName}. The two of us are pretty close.

TAG: Flynn_020_f
You know, after seeing you in action, I've gotta admit... You're not so bad.

TAG: Flynn_021_f
Maybe someday kids in an orphanage will gather around and read "The Tales of {PlayerName}." You can inspire some kid to become a hero.
