Bless me bagpipes! <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem>! I haven't seen a plate of these since before the Forgetting!

They're from that fine young lass Mirabel, aren't they? Always so caring and kind, that one.

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
A fine addition to the Village!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm glad you're happy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Mirabel wanted to thank you for staying.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That's one of the nicest things I've heard you say about anyone.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Well, thank you for bringing 'em to me, {PlayerName}. I'll have to thank Mirabel myself later.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Well, it's much appreciated. Both her message and your delivery. Thanks to the both of ya!

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Och! Just because I sound a wee bit harsh from time to time doesn't mean I don't like my neighbors.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
You, for example, {PlayerName}. Thank you for bringing me this fine, home-cooked meal. It was very kindly of ya.
