{PlayerName}, am I glad to see you! We've got to talk about Mirabel and my nephew.

TAG: Scrooge_001_f
I tell you, young people these days...

TAG: Scrooge_002_f
Just tell me what happened.

TAG: Scrooge_003_f
Gladly.

TAG: Scrooge_004_f
Donald and I were havin' a bit of an argument, as the lad was makin' a scene in my shop when customers were trying to browse...

TAG: Scrooge_005_f
Mirabel heard us and asked us to go with her on a stroll. I don't know what she was expecting, but I wager it wasn't what she got.

TAG: Scrooge_006_f
The next thing I knew, my nephew knocked me over and fell in the river.

TAG: Scrooge_007_f
... And a raccoon ran off with my <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh dear. I'm sorry.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Is there anything I can do?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Mirabel had the best of intentions.

TAG: Scrooge_008_f
It's not your fault, {PlayerName}. But someone has to set that nephew of mine straight.

TAG: Scrooge_009_f
And I need my <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> back, too!

TAG: Scrooge_010_f
Well, someone has to set that nephew of mine straight. And I need my <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> back, too!

TAG: Scrooge_011_f
Och, I don't doubt it. But I did end up with mud on my clothes and a lost <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Scrooge_012_f
Someone has to set that nephew of mine straight. And I cannae do without my <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem>!
