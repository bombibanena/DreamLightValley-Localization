Hey, Olaf... you're nervous about getting older, right?

TAG: Olaf_001_f
Nervous? No! I can't wait to be older!

TAG: Olaf_002_f
When you're ancient, so much more makes sense.

TAG: Olaf_003_f
I'm hoping that someday everyone will think of me as... (ahem)... Olaf the Wise!

TAG: Olaf_004_f
Well, I'm trying to find someone nervous about growing older who can help the Forgotten with a poem.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Did you want to try to help anyway?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds like you're not the Villager I need. See you around!

TAG: Olaf_005_f
Sure! Tell me the poem! I'd love to help.

TAG: Olaf_006_f
<Lore>As I watch the clock tick and the sun rise and set...</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_007_f
<Lore>I fear what I love, I am doomed to forget.</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_008_f
<Lore>But I've never been one to do what I'm told...</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_009_f
<Lore>...a warm hug can melt a heart that's gone cold!</Lore>

TAG: Olaf_010_f
What do you think?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Brilliant!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Aw, Olaf!

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Bit cheesy, isn't it?

TAG: Olaf_011_f
I'm glad you like it.

TAG: Olaf_012_f
You warmed my heart, but... it's not really the Forgotten's style.

TAG: Olaf_013_f
I guess I'll just have to keep looking for <Lore>someone worried about growing older</Lore>...

TAG: Olaf_014_f
I prefer to think of it as sincere!

TAG: Olaf_015_f
It definitely is... coming from you. But it's just not really the Forgotten's style.

TAG: Olaf_016_f
Bye, {PlayerName}! If the Forgotten needs any help with fun facts... I could definitely help with that!
