Ooga-tabah! Stitch lost!

TAG: Stitch_002_f
{PlayerName} lost too?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes... Completely.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Only momentarily.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I'm never lost.

TAG: Stitch_004_f
Oh... Maybe Stitch and {PlayerName} work together.

TAG: Stitch_007_f
Stitch found clue... "Underground, there's a babbling pool; quick, cast your hook."

TAG: Stitch_008_f
Maybe Stitch's friend Donald help Stitch and {PlayerName}.

TAG: Stitch_009_f
I asked Donald to participate. He said no.

TAG: Stitch_011_f
Oh, next time Stitch will ask him too.

TAG: Stitch_013_f
I'll look around for the <ActivityItem>Fifth Clue</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Stitch_014_f
Okitaka!

TAG: Stitch_010_f
Maybe I should have asked Donald to participate in the end.

TAG: Stitch_012_f
Hmm... Next time! Now WE play.

TAG: Stitch_005_f
Can {PlayerName} help Stitch when not lost?

TAG: Stitch_006_f
Can {PlayerName} help Stitch since not lost?
