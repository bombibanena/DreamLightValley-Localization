How marvelous! A <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> with an M engraved in it!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Now, this may not look like much, {PlayerName}, but it's proof your efforts against the Forgetting are bearing fruit.

TAG: Player_000_f
I found this lying around the Village...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Someone must be locked outside their home.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Who does it belong to?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I thought the local expert on weirdness might know what it is...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Oh, no, no. Not to worry, {PlayerName}. This <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> belongs to a charming lass named Mirabel Madrigal.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
You wanted her to feel at home. So, with my help, you enchanted her House to remind her of where she's from.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How do you prove that to a House?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
So even the buildings are judging me now...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
The enchantment gave the building the power to reflect Mirabel's kindness and energy. But even so...

TAG: Merlin_005_f
We never expected Mini-Casita to become quite so magical and so protective of its inhabitant.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
What do you mean?

TAG: Merlin_007_f
When the Forgetting struck, Mirabel, like many of us, started to lose her memories. Then, one morning, her House wasn't there anymore...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I quickly went to investigate, and what I discovered astonished me.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
To protect Mirabel, her home disappeared into a small universe of its own.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Finding this <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> can only mean one thing. Mini-Casita is considering coming back.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
But first, you'll need to prove to it that the Valley is safe once again.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Marvelous!

TAG: Merlin_035_f
After all, everyone appreciates being thought of.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
The more acts of kindness you perform, the more magic the <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> will gain. Once it has enough, Mini-Casita will return.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
I'll give this a trial run. I'll talk to you once I'm done.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Now, houses believe in deeds, not words. And houses often come to resemble their inhabitants.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
To prove the Valley's safe for Mirabel, you'll have to embody the Madrigals' values.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
What are the Madrigals' values?

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Well, I'm told they always believe in bringing their village together to help the community.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
And I remember Mirabel checking in on everyone here to ensure their needs were fulfilled. Oh, and she also became quite fond of photographs, if that helps.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Hmmm... I could take some pictures of Villagers.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
As for making sure everyone's needs are fulfilled... I could check what the Villagers need and give them some gifts.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Fine ideas indeed, {PlayerName}. Why, simply engaging some of the Villagers in conversation might be enough.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
Not to worry. You'll find it's rather simple.

TAG: Merlin_025_f
Oh. Heh-heh-heh, uh, well. Most magical things have opinions...

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Houses.

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Swords.

TAG: Merlin_028_f
Sugar bowls...

TAG: Merlin_029_f
Sounds like there's a story there.

TAG: Merlin_030_f
Some other time, perhaps. We must focus on bringing Mirabel back to the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
The Old Ruler wanted her to feel at home. So, with my help, they enchanted her House to remind her of where she's from.

TAG: Merlin_032_f
Why, this belongs to a charming young lass named Mirabel Madrigal.

TAG: Merlin_033_f
Heh. "Expert on weirdness." That's not a title I've ever heard before, but it does have a sort of ring to it, doesn't it?

TAG: Merlin_034_f
Now then, this <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> belongs to a charming young lass named Mirabel Madrigal.
