Anna's looking to share a little taste of Arendelle with some other Villagers.

TAG: Remy_004_f
She wants a few servings of <ActivityItem>Arendellian Pickled Herring</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_005_f
What do you say? You up to the challenge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.

And remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.

TAG: Remy_015_f
Hey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Remember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.

Anna's having a chocolate-tasting party later. She's pretty excited about all the chocolate treats we make here.

TAG: Remy_008_f
And she's hoping for a full-on chocolate buffet. Multiple dishes made with <ActivityItem>Cocoa</ActivityItem>. The specific dishes are up to you.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Think you can handle that? It's a great opportunity to diversify your dessert menu.

Olaf has asked Anna to teach him about the finer points of haute cuisine. Olaf won't actually EAT the meals. He just wants to get a look at them and evaluate the presentation.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Knowing Olaf, he could turn out to be a regular Anton Ego without ever taking a bite.

TAG: Remy_012_f
So, Anna's looking for some <ActivityItem>5-Star Meals</ActivityItem> to teach Olaf. What do you say?

TAG: Remy_001_f
{PlayerName}! I've got a special delivery order for you!
