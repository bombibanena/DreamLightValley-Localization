{PlayerName}, you know, you're getting to be a pretty incredible chef.

TAG: Remy_001_f
Feel like you're ready for a challenge?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Definitely!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm not sure.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Even cooking cereal is too much of a challenge for me.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Great!

TAG: Remy_003_f
I was thinking we could open up some new culinary possibilities by <Lore>testing your cooking skills each day</Lore>.

TAG: Remy_004_f
And since you're a pro now, <Lore>I WON'T be giving you the recipes first</Lore>. You'll have to figure them out yourself.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Don't worry. I'm not asking you to work for free. If this works, we'll both get rewarded.

TAG: Remy_010_f
What do you say, {PlayerName}?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, chef! I'd love some daily cooking challenges!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds like it's not for me.

TAG: Remy_002_f
That's great!

TAG: Remy_012_f
Now, before we get started... feast your eyes on this. It's an old Chez Remy menu I found in the stock room...

TAG: Remy_005_f
No problem. If you ever change your mind, just come talk to me.

TAG: Remy_006_f
I think this would be a great way to help the whole Village... and test those cooking skills of yours!

TAG: Remy_008_f
That's fair. Why don't I tell you a little more about it first?

TAG: Remy_011_f
Don't sell yourself short! Hear me out first.
