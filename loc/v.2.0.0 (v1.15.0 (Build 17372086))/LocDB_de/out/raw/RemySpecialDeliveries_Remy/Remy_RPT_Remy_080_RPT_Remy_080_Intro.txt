Hey, {PlayerName}! Ready to challenge your cooking skills again?

TAG: Remy_003_f
Today's customers are... Simba and Nala.

TAG: Remy_024_f
I'm trying to show them that well-prepared, cooked food can be just as good as â nay, BETTER than â eating raw antelope.

TAG: Remy_025_f
They're a little skeptical. Which I understand. It took my family a while to appreciate good food too.

TAG: Remy_026_f
Anyway, I was thinking you could bring them some <ActivityItem>5-Star Meals</ActivityItem> to show them the pleasures of fine dining. The delivery can go to Simba.

TAG: Remy_008_f
What do you say? Are you up to the challenge?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.

TAG: Remy_010_f
And remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Hey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Remember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.

TAG: Remy_017_f
Jack Skellington came into the restaurant today and placed an odd order. Man, that guy is tall. He had to bend in half to tell me what he wanted!

TAG: Remy_018_f
Turns out he's looking for some <ActivityItem>Spaghetti Arrabbiata, Hardboiled Eggs, and Roasted Asparagus</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_027_f
It's not my idea of a well-coordinated three-course meal, but "to each his own," I guess.

TAG: Remy_019_f
Scrooge McDuck would like a meal that reminds him of home. Do you think you can make something so that he feels like he's back in Castle McDuck?

TAG: Remy_020_f
Some <ActivityItem>Potato Leek Soup, Baked Carp, and Gooseberry Pie</ActivityItem> ought to do the trick.

TAG: Remy_028_f
Anna wants to prove to Kristoff that you can serve chocolate for every meal, not just dessert.

TAG: Remy_029_f
She'd like some <ActivityItem>Hot Cocoa, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Chocolate Waffles, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Mint Chocolate</ActivityItem> to change his mind. The delivery should go to Kristoff.

TAG: Remy_053_f
Goofy and Vanellope are having a pie-eating contest.

TAG: Remy_054_f
They need two of each of these kinds of pies...

TAG: Remy_055_f
They want an <ActivityItem>Apple Pie, Blueberry Pie...</ActivityItem>

TAG: Remy_057_f
...*deep breath*...

TAG: Remy_058_f
<ActivityItem>...Seafood Pie, and Veggie Pie!</ActivityItem>

TAG: Remy_059_f
Wow. I feel full just saying all that. I can't even imagine eating it all. They said to deliver everything to Goofy.

TAG: Remy_060_f
Mickey and Goofy are going ice-fishing in the Frosted Heights together, and they're looking for a nice meal to keep them warm.

TAG: Remy_061_f
I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Hot Cocoa, Creamy Soup, Greek Pizza, and Jam Waffles</ActivityItem>. Mickey said we can deliver everything to him.

TAG: Remy_085_f
You're not going to believe it, but I just got an order from Woody and Buzz.

TAG: Remy_086_f
It's a pretty strange one, too... They're looking for <ActivityItem>Roasted Asparagus,<lw>Gingerbread Houses, and Ranch Salad</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_087_f
I know those toys don't eat, so I wonder what they plan to use it all for... Well anyway, they want you to take the delivery to Woody.

TAG: Remy_088_f
Some of the other Villagers pooled together their Star Coins to buy a thank-you meal for Merlin.

TAG: Remy_089_f
Whenever there's a strange problem around here, he always knows what to do.

TAG: Remy_090_f
So the Villagers figured he might like a nice <ActivityItem>Cheese Platter, some Fish Creole, and Pastry Cream and Puffs</ActivityItem> for dessert.

TAG: Remy_022_f
{PlayerName}! I've got another special delivery order for you.

TAG: Remy_023_f
Hey, {PlayerName}, have you got time for another Chez Remy Mobile order?
