Well, {PlayerName}? How did things go with Donald?

TAG: Remy_002_f
What was he using all those dishes for?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
A celebration of himself.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
They were a tribute to his favorite duck.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Eh... don't ask.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Yep. That sounds about right.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Well, in any case, your skills are getting pretty incredible. Who knows? Someday you might open Chez {PlayerName}!

Here you go. Some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem>, courtesy of Mr. McDuck.

Use it to build something great for the Village. The more deliveries you do for Chez Remy Mobile, the more we'll be able to order.

TAG: Remy_012_f
His favorite duck... I'm going to go out on a limb and guess he means himself.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Heh, okay. I won't. I find that's often safest when it comes to Donald.

TAG: Remy_014_f
What was the idea behind all those desserts?

TAG: Player_002_f
They're apology desserts.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
For when he loses his temper.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I think he'll need to order some more soon.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
But he'll probably eat them before he needs to apologize.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Oh boy. Well, at least it gave you a chance to show off your culinary skills.

TAG: Remy_015_f
What was Donald using all that seafood for?

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I'd rather not embarrass him.

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
It was part of a scheme to trick Goofy into thinking he caught them all.

TAG: Remy_017_f
Heh. Okay. Forget I asked.

TAG: Remy_018_f
Huh? Kinda funny he wanted it all cooked first.
