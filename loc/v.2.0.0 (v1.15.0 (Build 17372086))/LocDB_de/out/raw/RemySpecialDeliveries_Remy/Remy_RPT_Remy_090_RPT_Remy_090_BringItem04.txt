Things are about to get a lot spicier at Chez Remy.

Just don't break these ones too, okay?

Yep. I'm going to make a multi-course meal that includes each spice, just to celebrate. It'll be a medley of flavor!

Use it to build something great for the Village. The more you do for Chez Remy, the more we'll be able to order.

Heh, don't worry. I'll definitely be more careful.
