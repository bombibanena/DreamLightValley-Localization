Well, {PlayerName}? How did things go with Stitch?

TAG: Remy_003_f
Did you manage to actually make all that food?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
It was a snap!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
It took me FOREVER.

TAG: Remy_013_f
That's great! I'm glad to hear it wasn't too tough.

TAG: Remy_004_f
Your skills are getting pretty incredible. Who knows? Someday you might open Chez {PlayerName}!

Here you go. Some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem>, courtesy of Mr. McDuck.

Use it to build something great for the Village. The more deliveries you do for Chez Remy Mobile, the more we'll be able to order.

TAG: Remy_014_f
I'm not surprised. That was a REALLY big order.

TAG: Remy_009_f
What did Stitch want with all that seafood?

TAG: Remy_015_f
To play a prank on Donald.

TAG: Remy_016_f
Wow. That could go wrong in so many ways. But I'm sure you handled it.

What was he up to with those gingerbread houses?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
They were for Mother Gothel.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
They were for a mean old witch who lives in a tree.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Oh. Oookay. That was... nice of Stitch, I guess? Anyway, thanks for helping with all that.

TAG: Remy_012_f
What? Oh, Mother Gothel! Boy, Stitch sure knows how to pick his enemies. Anyway, thanks for helping with all that.
