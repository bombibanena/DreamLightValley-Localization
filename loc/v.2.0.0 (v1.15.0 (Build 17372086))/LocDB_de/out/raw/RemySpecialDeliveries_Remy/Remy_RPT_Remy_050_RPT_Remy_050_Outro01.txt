Well, {PlayerName}? How did things go with the Fairy Godmother?

Did the pumpkin party go off without a hitch?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Mission accomplished!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
That was a tough one.

Your skills are getting pretty incredible. Who knows? Someday you might open Chez {PlayerName}!

Use it to build something great for the Village. The more deliveries you do for Chez Remy Mobile, the more we'll be able to order.

You're getting better at this every day. Who knows? You might even open your own restaurant someday.

Hey, making mistakes is how we learn. Remind me to tell you about that time I mixed up the sugar and salt when I was making a tarte Tatin once.

Did Minnie like those dreamy treats?

TAG: Remy_010_f
Who were those desserts meant for anyway?

TAG: Player_001_f
They were for Ursula. The Fairy Godmother was trying to prove that sometimes you can do something nice for someone without expecting anything in return.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
It didn't work, though.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I think it secretly made Ursula happy.

TAG: Remy_011_f
Yeah, Ursula thinks everything needs to be some sort of deal. But it was nice of the Fairy Godmother to try.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Even if she'll never admit it, I'm sure Ursula appreciated the gesture.
