Hey, {PlayerName}! I hope you're ready to cook something for one of my favorite Villagers...

TAG: Remy_002_f
Today's customer is Mirabel!

TAG: Remy_003_f
She's looking for a little taste of home: some orders of <ActivityItem>BuÃ±uelos</ActivityItem> to share with other Villagers.

TAG: Remy_005_f
What do you say? Are you up to the challenge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.

TAG: Remy_007_f
And remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Hey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Remember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.

Actually, to be more specific â Olaf is looking to send something special to Mirabel.

TAG: Remy_011_f
They spent some time together in the Frosted Heights, so he wants to send her some <ActivityItem>Hot Cocoa</ActivityItem> to warm her up.

TAG: Remy_012_f
Seems like something you can handle, right?

TAG: Remy_013_f
And this request is kinda funny. I guess Mirabel's been feeding the birds in the Forgotten Lands...

TAG: Remy_014_f
...and she realized that they only really like <ActivityItem>5-Star Meals</ActivityItem>. Those birds are harsher critics than Anton Ego!

TAG: Remy_015_f
What do you say? Ready to make some gourmet meals for some very picky customers?

TAG: Remy_016_f
{PlayerName}! I've got a special delivery order for you. And this is going to be a fun one!

TAG: Remy_017_f
{PlayerName}! Are you ready to make another special delivery for Chez Remy Mobile?
