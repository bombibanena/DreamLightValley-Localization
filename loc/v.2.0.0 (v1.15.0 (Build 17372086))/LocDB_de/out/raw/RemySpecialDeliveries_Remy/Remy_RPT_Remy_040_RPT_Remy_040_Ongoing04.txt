Have you been able to help Scar yet?

Remember: Our best bet is to give him some major <ActivityItem>Seafood Meals</ActivityItem> so he's too full to look elsewhere for food. *gulp*

Oh! It looks like you've already cooked the dishes. Now you just need to bring them to him.

Some <ActivityItem>Sushi</ActivityItem> ought to fill up his highness enough to leave me alone.

Scar's looking for <ActivityItem>Desserts</ActivityItem>. Seems suspicious, but maybe he's suddenly gotten a sweet tooth...
