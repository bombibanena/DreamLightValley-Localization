Hey, {PlayerName}! I've got another cooking challenge for you.

TAG: Remy_017_f
This one's for Donald. And, just a heads-up, he can get cranky if he doesn't get his food in a timely manner.

TAG: Remy_002_f
Anyway, he ordered <ActivityItem>5-Star Meals</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_003_f
He didn't say why. Maybe he's having friends over for dinner?

TAG: Remy_004_f
What do you say? You up to the challenge?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Let's do it!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Remy_005_f
Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.

TAG: Remy_006_f
And remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.

TAG: Remy_007_f
Hey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.

TAG: Remy_008_f
Remember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.

TAG: Remy_009_f
He ordered a variety of <ActivityItem>Desserts</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_010_f
I'm not sure what the occasion is. You'll have to ask him.

TAG: Remy_011_f
What do you think? It's a great opportunity to diversify your dessert menu.

TAG: Remy_012_f
He ordered <ActivityItem>Seafood Meals</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_013_f
A LOT of seafood meals. Maybe it's a sailor thing.

TAG: Remy_014_f
What do you say? You might need to stock up on supplies from Dazzle Beach.

TAG: Remy_015_f
{PlayerName}! I've got a special delivery order for you. And this one's going to be tough.

TAG: Remy_016_f
{PlayerName}! Are you ready to make another special delivery for Chez Remy Mobile?
