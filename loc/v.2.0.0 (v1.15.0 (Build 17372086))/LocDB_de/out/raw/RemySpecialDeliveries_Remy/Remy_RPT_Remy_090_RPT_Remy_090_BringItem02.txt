Perfect! These are just what I need to add a romantic air to the restaurant for special occasions. Thanks, {PlayerName}.

May I suggest some nice candles and romantic music too?

I had to run all over the Valley to get all of that!

Absolutely! You really understand the importance of setting a mood when it comes to the experience of a meal.

Use it to build something great for the Village. The more you do for Chez Remy, the more we'll be able to order.
