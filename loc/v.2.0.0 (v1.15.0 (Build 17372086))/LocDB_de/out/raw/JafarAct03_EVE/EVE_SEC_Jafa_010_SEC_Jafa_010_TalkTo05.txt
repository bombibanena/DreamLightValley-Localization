Hey EVE! Can we talk about Jafar for a moment?

TAG: EVE_008_f
Directive!

TAG: EVE_010_f
You know, after hearing what everyone has told me... I think that maybe we should do something for Jafar.

TAG: EVE_011_f
Oh?

TAG: EVE_012_f
Yeah, well it's clear that Jafar is trying to ingratiate himself to everyone now.

TAG: EVE_013_f
We should do something to show that we appreciate the effort.

TAG: EVE_014_f
Hmm...

TAG: EVE_015_f
Let's see, he did kinda show his own interests with his gift choices â we should use that to start!

TAG: EVE_016_f
I've got it! We'll decorate around the Palace with furniture that's <Lore>Red</Lore>, <Lore>Black</Lore>, <Lore>Elegant</Lore>, <Lore>Bold</Lore>, and <Lore>Traditional</Lore>!

TAG: EVE_002_f
Oh! Whoo!

TAG: EVE_017_f
Maybe I should talk to Merlin to get a little something extra special too...

TAG: EVE_003_f
You're... happy about Jafar? That's a big surprise!

TAG: EVE_004_f
EVE! Ta-da!

TAG: EVE_005_f
A glass flower? That's so <Lore>elegant</Lore>, EVE. Did Jafar give that to you?

TAG: EVE_006_f
*affirmative digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_007_f
Well, that's very nice of him â an elegant flower for an elegant machine!
