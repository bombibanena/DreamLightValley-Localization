Hey EVE, how you holding up?

TAG: EVE_009_f
Cool! The trial will be happening in the <Lore>Ancient Ruins</Lore>. I'll make sure you get informed when we're ready to start.

TAG: EVE_001_f
Uh... Directive?

TAG: EVE_002_f
Oh, I'm in the middle of putting a trial together for Jafar...

TAG: EVE_003_f
Whoo!

TAG: EVE_004_f
Ha! Thought you might be happy with that.

TAG: EVE_005_f
I was hoping you could help me with something else.

TAG: EVE_006_f
I need someone to keep an eye on Jafar until the trial starts.

TAG: EVE_007_f
If he starts building some suspicious-looking machine, you have my permission to use your laser on it.

TAG: EVE_008_f
Directive! Whoo!
