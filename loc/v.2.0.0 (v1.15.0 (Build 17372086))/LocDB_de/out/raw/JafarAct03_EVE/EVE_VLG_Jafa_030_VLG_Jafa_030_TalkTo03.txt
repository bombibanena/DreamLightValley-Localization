Hey EVE, you feeling okay today?

TAG: EVE_009_f
Ahh!

TAG: EVE_010_f
Oh â you're drawing something with your laser? A letter J?

TAG: EVE_011_f
Whoo! Name! Plant! Home!

TAG: EVE_012_f
Whoa, slow down there, EVE.

TAG: EVE_013_f
Name! Plant! Home!

TAG: EVE_014_f
Name... J... Are you talking about Jafar? Plant... or planting? Jafar planting something in your home?

TAG: EVE_015_f
No.

TAG: EVE_016_f
Jafar planted something in OTHER Villagers' homes?

TAG: EVE_017_f
*affirmative digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_018_f
But what does that have to do with them acting strangely?

TAG: EVE_001_f
No!

TAG: EVE_019_f
Hmm? Directive?

TAG: EVE_020_f
All right, I'm gonna look into this further, maybe <Lore>check out the Houses of those three</Lore>.

TAG: EVE_021_f
Thanks, EVE!

TAG: EVE_002_f
Oh no! Are you sick?

TAG: EVE_003_f
No! Directive.

TAG: EVE_004_f
Well, this is strange. I spoke with Rapunzel, Gaston, and Mr. McDuck, and they all... seem super weird today.

TAG: EVE_005_f
Oh... Oh! *digital beeps*

TAG: EVE_006_f
They were all saying some mean things... about you. It's just not like them.

TAG: EVE_007_f
Oh... *sigh*

TAG: EVE_008_f
But I don't think they meant it! Do you have any idea what's going on?
