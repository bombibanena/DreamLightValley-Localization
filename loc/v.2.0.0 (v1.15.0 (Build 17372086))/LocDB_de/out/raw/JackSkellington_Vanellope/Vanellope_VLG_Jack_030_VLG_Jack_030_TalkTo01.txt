Hey Vanellope! Can I ask you a question?

TAG: Vanellope_001_f
Sure, you just did!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Nice one.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Eh, you've had better zingers.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Moving on...

TAG: Vanellope_002_f
Glad someone recognizes my comedic genius!

TAG: Vanellope_005_f
I'm trying to help Jack Skellington with something.

What's your favorite holiday?

TAG: Vanellope_007_f
Holiday?

TAG: Vanellope_008_f
Oh, I know those from the Internet!

TAG: Vanellope_009_f
Holidays are when your game has multi-week-long events, new mini-games, and sometimes a new kind of currency, right?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
... Kinda?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
Honestly, close enough.

Sugar Rush was too old to be connected to the Internet, and Slaughter Race hasn't had any that I can think of, so I can't say I've experienced one.

TAG: Vanellope_011_f
But they sound fun! I love the idea of special power-ups that give you new and exciting powers!

TAG: Vanellope_012_f
Great! I'll tell Jack â expect something fun when Dreamlight Day kicks off!

TAG: Vanellope_003_f
Hey, at least I have zingers, chumbo. Or should I call you "let-me-plan-my-joke-two-weeks-in-advance"-bo?

TAG: Vanellope_004_f
That's right, run in fear of my superior humor!
