Ahh, {PlayerName}, what new magical mystery do you have for me today?

TAG: Player_000_f
Back before the Forgetting, I took something away from Scar and hid it with some sort of enchantment. Something he can only get back if he learns a lesson...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I want to help him.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Enchantments and old riddles are your forte.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Past {PlayerName} is making life extra hard...

TAG: Merlin_006_f
You wanted to help him then, too. In fact, you took his most treasured possession and told him he'd only get it back if he understood that...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
<Lore>"Good rulers care for everyone, from the tallest to the smallest. They invite everyone to the table."</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Quite inspired, I thought. But then, you've always been wise beyond your years.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Now, I'm sure you've noticed that Scar is not always the most pleasant of neighbors.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
He wants to rule, but he doesn't understand the responsibilities and the care that come with it. You tried to help him...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
...but then he turned around and tried to eat one of the birds on the Sunlit Plateau.

TAG: Player_002_f
When I said inviting others to your table...

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
...I meant those birds as guests!

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
...I wasn't speaking literally.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
...I could have been clearer.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Yes, and not only the Sunbirds. You meant everyone, from all segments of the Circle of Life.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
I suggest you continue leading by example. Put up some <ActivityItem>Sunbird Feeders</ActivityItem> on the Plateau.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Show him how to care for his kingdom. Maybe that will help where your curse has failed...

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That would be so cute.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Let's hope it works.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
I'll do whatever it takes.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Don't let the Sunbirds' fragile appearance fool you, {PlayerName}. They have a fascinating yet dangerous life.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Trust your instincts. Deep down, you always know what to do, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
"Whatever it takes"? Hmm.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Just be careful not to become too much like Scar in your pursuit of your goals.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Yes, you meant that he should care for everyone, from all segments of the Circle of Life.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
You wanted Scar to think about his actions. You meant that he should care for everyone, from all segments of the Circle of Life.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Hmm. Yes, I remember what you said when you took it from him and hid it all those years ago.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Hmm, yes. Sometimes things we did long ago can seem like the deeds of strangers to us.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
But I remember what it was you said back when you hid his little trinket.
