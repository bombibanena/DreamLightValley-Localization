Ah, {PlayerName}! You're here to ask me for help with Anna's plight, aren't you?

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I tried to explain the spell to her, but when I speak to the other Villagers about magic, they look at me as if I'm speaking gibberish. It's the oddest thing.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
It all makes sense to me.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I can mostly understand you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Half the time, it IS gibberish!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Yes, I know. Your magical sensibilities are quite advanced.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
But not just any mushroom. You must go to the shadow of the Giant Willow in the Glade of Trust and pick some of the <ActivityItem>Red Mushrooms</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Once you have those, find a Crafting Station and mix it all together with this acceleration liquid...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
In any case, now that Kristoff has begun to regain some of his memories, I know just the thing to bring back the rest!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
You'll need something that's important to both Anna and Kristoff to enchant. Something symbolic of their love.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Hmm... maybe their <ActivityItem>Engagement Ring</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Oh yes, that'll do nicely.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Now, you'll also need some <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>, to give it that spark of magic...

TAG: Merlin_001_f
...and to draw out memories buried in the dark, you'll need a fungus.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
A fungus?!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
A mushroom, to be precise.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Hmm... I suppose I do have to remember that not everyone is versed in magical terminology. I shall strive to approach them as students requiring clear explanations.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
On the contrary, my language is extremely precise. Read a few more books and you'll be able to follow along quite well.
