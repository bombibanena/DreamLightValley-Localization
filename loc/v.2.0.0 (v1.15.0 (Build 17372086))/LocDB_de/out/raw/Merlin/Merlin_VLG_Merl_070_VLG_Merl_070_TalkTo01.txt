Ready... to become a wizard yourself!

Wow!

This is a book on how to enchant objects.

It's written in riddles, which any true wizard can decipher.

I'll give you just one hint â you need the <ActivityItem>Ice Tear Seed</ActivityItem>.

It was hidden in the binding of the book. Here you are.

I wouldn't offer the challenge if I weren't absolutely certain of it.
