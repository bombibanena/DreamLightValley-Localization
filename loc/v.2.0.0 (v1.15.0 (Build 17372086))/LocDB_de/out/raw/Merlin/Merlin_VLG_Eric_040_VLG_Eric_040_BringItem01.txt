Eric found it on an expedition. I want to enchant this Compass to find more like it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I need your help to do it.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Teach me how.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Do it for me.

Well, I'm always happy to help anyone interested in learning more about the world, {PlayerName}.

Now, if you wish to enchant this Compass, we'll need a few materials. Our method will be similar to the one we used to find Donald.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
First, find some <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Crystals</ActivityItem>. Then, bring it all back to me once you've finished.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
I do like your gumption, {PlayerName}! Always eager to learn new things.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Eh-eh-eh, {PlayerName}. I can't be expected to do everything for you... though I am happy to show you how...
