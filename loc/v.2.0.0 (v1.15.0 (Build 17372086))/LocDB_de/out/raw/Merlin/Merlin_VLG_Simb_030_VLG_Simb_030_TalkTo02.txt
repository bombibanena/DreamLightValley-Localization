Ah, {PlayerName}, you look like you're in pursuit of knowledge. How may I be of assistance?

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I've found this room below the Sunlit Plateau with seeds in it and...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
The Herbalist Room! What marvelous news! Why, I'd forgotten all about it.

TAG: Player_003_f
I want to get something called the Dreamlight Tree Seed for Simba... But it's stuck in a machine inside that room.

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
I need your help. Please.

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
What does it all mean?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
You're really good at understanding this nonsense...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Not to worry, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
You'll need <ActivityItem>Blueberries</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> for the <ActivityItem>Potion of Growth</ActivityItem>. <ActivityItem>Orange Marsh Milkweed</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Night Shards</ActivityItem> for the <ActivityItem>Potion of Dust</ActivityItem>. And an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem> for each potion.

Once you've prepared them, just place them in the proper spot in the Herbalist Room and the machine should do the rest for you.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
The room you stumbled upon is a fascinating part of our history. In the past, you used it to do experiments regarding the Valley's flora...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
You hid the room to keep the experiments safe from the prying eyes of those who might want to use them for nefarious purposes. Like Scar...

TAG: Merlin_000_f
You wanted to create a haven for the critters, and you chose Simba to watch over it.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Using a cutting of the tree above the Well in the Plaza, and after a lot of trial and error, you managed to create a new plant called the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
That's all well and good, but how does it help us with our problem right now?

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Ah... The impatience of youth. I was just about to explain that part...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Right now, the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seed</ActivityItem> is... Well, let's say it's "slumbering." You'll need to awaken it so it can be planted anew.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
If I recall, you first gave life to it with two potions. The <ActivityItem>Potion of Growth</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Potion of Dust</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Well, if it's nonsense, it's your nonsense! You have only your past self to blame for it. But there's no need to fret. I'll help you.
