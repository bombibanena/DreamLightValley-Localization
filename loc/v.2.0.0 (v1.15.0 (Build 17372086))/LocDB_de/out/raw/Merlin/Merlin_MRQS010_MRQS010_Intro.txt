Maybe if we get rid of the Night Thorns...

TAG: Merlin_000_f
What's this? Are my spectacles enchanted or might you actually be real?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Of course I'm real!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I don't know. Are you...?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
What kind of question is that?!

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Well, you never can be too sure around here.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me. I haven't met anyone in ages...

TAG: Merlin_060_f
Ahem... Welcome to <Lore>Dreamlight Valley</Lore>, my friend!

TAG: Merlin_025_f
<Lore>Dreamlight Valley</Lore>? This place is...

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
...strangely beautiful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
...sort of creepy.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
...awfully mysterious.

TAG: Merlin_034_f
This place is so cool. I want to explore it!

TAG: Merlin_027_f
Quite understandable. Why, in all my travels, I've yet to find another realm as filled with magic and wonder.

TAG: Merlin_029_f
In its present state, however, it's a... well, it's a sorry sight indeed.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Oh, but I haven't introduced myself yet! You're no doubt wondering who I am.

TAG: Player_000_choice_009_f
Duh. You're Merlin!

TAG: Player_000_choice_010_f
Um. You're some sorta... wizard?

TAG: Player_000_choice_011_f
You're a very odd old man.

TAG: Merlin_039_f
It's so strange. I almost feel like I know you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_012_f
Magic? Me? Ha! No way.

TAG: Player_000_choice_013_f
I don't know HOW I got here!

TAG: Player_000_choice_015_f
Oh, uh, yes! Great magic!

TAG: Merlin_044_f
You're a great and powerful wizard, right?

TAG: Merlin_046_f
Well... yes... but not just any wizard!

TAG: Merlin_041_f
I'm a soothsayer! A prognosticator! I have the power to see into the future.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
And I'm also quite skilled at alchemy and prestidigitation!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Now that that's settled, there's the small matter of who YOU are...

TAG: Merlin_038_f
Me? I'm {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_052_f
{PlayerName}, hmm? Well, the only way to get to Dreamlight Valley is to pass through <Lore>dreams</Lore>...

TAG: Merlin_047_f
So you must also possess great magic. Otherwise, how could you be here?

TAG: Merlin_048_f
When it comes to magic, I can't tell an "abracadabra" from an "alacazam."

TAG: Merlin_055_f
Oh, I think you'll find that magic often chooses us. And rarely does it choose unwisely.

TAG: Merlin_054_f
In fact, I'm quite certain that you're the one we've been waiting for. <Lore>You're going to save Dreamlight Valley</Lore>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_016_f
What can I do to help?

TAG: Player_000_choice_017_f
What's in it for me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_018_f
Save it from... what?

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Ah-ha! That spirit of friendship is just what Dreamlight Valley needs!

TAG: Merlin_008_f
All right, listen closely and I'll tell you the tale... before I forget again!

TAG: Merlin_045_f
And as I can see into the future, I knew that someday, someone would come to help restore the Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Tell me more about the Forgetting.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Tell me more about the missing Ruler.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
I'm ready to help restore the Valley!

TAG: Merlin_011_f
If we're to restore the Valley to what it was...

TAG: Merlin_014_f
A place of magic, of wonder, of friendship...

TAG: Merlin_017_f
We need to stop <Lore>the Forgetting</Lore>, once and for all.

TAG: Merlin_058_f
We must... we must...!

TAG: Merlin_057_f
I'm... I'm sorry, I can't seem to remember what we were talking about.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
<Lore>The Forgetting</Lore>...?

TAG: Merlin_037_f
Ah, yes! <Lore>The Forgetting</Lore>!

TAG: Merlin_059_f
You'll have to forgive me, but now you can see where it gets its name.

TAG: Merlin_061_f
Yes, yes, of course. Let me see... Well, when our <Lore>Ruler</Lore> left, the sky turned dark.

TAG: Merlin_062_f
Then those horrid <Lore>Night Thorns</Lore> infested the Village, spreading everywhere like a bad thought.

TAG: Merlin_063_f
The more <Lore>Night Thorns</Lore> that appeared, the more clouded our memories became.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Why, sometimes I can't remember the faces of all the friends I've lost... or the names of all the spells I've forgotten...

TAG: Player_001_choice_003_f
...your memories will return.

TAG: Player_001_choice_004_f
...your friends will come back!

TAG: Player_001_choice_005_f
...the magic of the Valley will be stronger than ever.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
<Lore>Get rid of the Night Thorns</Lore>... Hmm... now there's an interesting thought...

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Well now, all the wonder, magic, and friendship in this Valley came from our <Lore>Ruler</Lore>. They watched over the Village, and kept us safe from Dark Magic.

TAG: Merlin_064_f
But one day, they started to act... different. Though I can scarcely remember it now.

TAG: Merlin_065_f
And then, our Ruler simply... vanished.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
It's been... years, I think... I've lost all track of time because of the Forgetting.

TAG: Player_002_f
Your Ruler just... up and left?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Doesn't sound like a great Ruler.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
There must have been some reason.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
Maybe the Forgetting made your Ruler leave?

TAG: Merlin_066_f
A good Ruler would take care of the Village and its people, not just run away.

TAG: Merlin_067_f
Oh, our Ruler was kind and very noble. There must have been quite a good reason for why they left. Though I can't remember what it was...

TAG: Merlin_068_f
Maybe your Ruler had to leave. Maybe they didn't have a choice.

TAG: Merlin_070_f
That certainly seems logical. Yes, the Forgetting must be connected to our Ruler in some way... if only I could remember how...

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Well, there's only one way to be absolutely certain you're the one destined to save Dreamlight Valley from the Forgetting.

TAG: Merlin_024_f
It'll be a small test of your magic...

TAG: Merlin_028_f
You see, ever since the Forgetting, I've been puzzled about this <Lore>House blocked by the Night Thorns.</Lore>

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Come along. We'll investigate it together.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Why, all the joys of Dreamlight Valley, of course!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
A wise question, indeed. After all, a problem can't be solved until it's understood!

TAG: Merlin_051_f
I just closed my eyes and drifted off and... all of a sudden, I was here!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Magic had nothing to do with it.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Quite the contrary. Magic had everything to do with it!

TAG: Merlin_049_f
Better watch out, Merlin. I'm pretty good at magic myself!

TAG: Merlin_050_f
You're not the only soothsayer, prognosticator, prestidigitator, and alchemist around here!

TAG: Merlin_053_f
Ah-ha! I knew it!

TAG: Merlin_040_f
Not just any wizard!

TAG: Merlin_023_f
I'm Merlin!

TAG: Merlin_042_f
"Odd old man"?! Why, I... I'm Merlin, I'll have you know! I'm a wizard! A very, very powerful wizard.

TAG: Merlin_043_f
And that's not all!

TAG: Merlin_035_f
This place isn't... dangerous, is it?

TAG: Merlin_030_f
Well, it's true that the Valley is a sorry sight compared to what it used to be. But you have nothing to fear.

TAG: Merlin_031_f
Why, once upon a time, you couldn't find another realm with as much magic and wonder in it.

TAG: Merlin_036_f
I feel like I could explore this place forever and still not find all its secrets!

TAG: Merlin_032_f
Yes, the Valley is full of mysteries.

TAG: Merlin_033_f
But there was a time when it was also filled with magic and wonder.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Hmm. That's quite an existential question. I'll have to ponder it later.

TAG: Merlin_026_f
Oh, dear. You must be dreadfully confused.
