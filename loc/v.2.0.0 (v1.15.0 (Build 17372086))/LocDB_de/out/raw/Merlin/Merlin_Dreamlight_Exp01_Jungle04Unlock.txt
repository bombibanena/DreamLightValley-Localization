{PlayerName}, I see you've found another <Lore>mysterious Time Rift</Lore>. This too is connected to the magic of your Hourglass.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Channel the magical <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> within it to mend this wound in time and space...

TAG: Merlin_002_f
When you do, you can explore another area of the Wild Tangle... the <Lore>Lagoon</Lore>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll channel the magic of the Hourglass... (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyMist" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not quite ready yet...

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Excellent work, {PlayerName}! You may now visit the Lagoon. I expect there are quite a few mysteries there to uncover.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Oh, that's rather unfortunate. I'm afraid you don't have enough <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> to mend this Time Rift yet.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Remember... the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> is <Lore>connected to the magic of your Hourglass and to Eternity Isle itself</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
You must keep uncovering wonders with your Hourglass and continue to make Eternity Isle a home. As you do, you'll gain the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> required!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Fine, fine. But be quick about it, {PlayerName}. This area of the Isle is quite crucial, you know.
