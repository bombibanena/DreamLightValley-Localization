{PlayerName}! THIS is the <Lore>Dream Castle</Lore>! It holds many secrets... er... answers... er... Oh, blast it all!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
I can't seem to remember what's inside.

TAG: Player_000_f
I bet that inside the Castle, we'll find...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...the key to saving the Valley!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
...riches beyond measure!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
...even more mysteries.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Precisely! The Castle is filled with mysteries and wonders.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
If we're going to restore Dreamlight Valley to its former glory, we must get inside.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
So let's go inside!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Remember anything else?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Those Night Thorns are huge!

TAG: Merlin_020_f
Easier said than done, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
The Night Thorns that encase the Dream Castle aren't like any you've dealt with before.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
They're stronger and will take more of your magic to defeat.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Follow me; there's still much to show you.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Yes. The Dream Castle was the home of our Ruler until the day they disappeared.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Ha-ha! You rather sound like a Mr. McDuck I know.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Well, I've no doubt the Castle contains many wonders.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Let's hope they include the secret to restoring Dreamlight Valley to its former glory.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
There's no doubt the Castle will have its share of mysteries to solve.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
But I'm hopeful it also holds the answers we seek...

TAG: Merlin_009_f
...such as the secret to restoring Dreamlight Valley to its former glory.
