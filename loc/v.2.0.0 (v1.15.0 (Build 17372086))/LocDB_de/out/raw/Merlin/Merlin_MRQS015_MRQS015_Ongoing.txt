Retrieve the Pickaxe, my friend! It's stuck in a stone here in the Plaza. And for as long as it's been there, darkness has hung over the Village.

You see, none of us can lift the Pickaxe. But there's something different about you, {PlayerName}. Perhaps you can do what we could not.

You must also find the other three <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem>: the Shovel, the Watering Can and the Fishing Rod.

You know, Goofy always liked to fish. Perhaps he can direct you to the lost Fishing Rod.

Though, I haven't heard from him since the stones blocked our path to the Meadow to the south.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
If you retrieve the Pickaxe, you'll be able to remove the rocks blocking the passage.

Mickey's been the gardener in the Village since the Forgetting. Perhaps he knows the whereabouts of the Watering Can and Shovel.
