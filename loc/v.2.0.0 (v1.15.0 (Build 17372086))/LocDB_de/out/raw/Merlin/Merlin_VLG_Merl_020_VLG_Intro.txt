Ah, {PlayerName}, there you are! I'm conducting a study of the magic in the Village...

TAG: Merlin_001_f
...and I could use your assistance. What do you say?

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
Let's do this!

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
Sorry, I can't help right now!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Marvelous! Now, to assist me, you must first hone your own magical skills.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Tell me: What do you want most from magic?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
To help Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
To understand it better.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
To become more powerful.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
A noble goal! Very worthwhile to pursue, indeed.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
We shall begin by gathering <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
They're a potent material, used to craft many magical items.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
You'll find them trapped inside of Night Thorns.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
That is very wise. Learning how to use magic is one thing...

TAG: Merlin_014_f
...but it's a far different challenge to understand how it works.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Yes, yes... WHAT?! No, no, no!

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Power is never an end in itself.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
You must reflect on what you wish TO DO with magical power.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Very well, but return soon. There's much to learn and discover!
