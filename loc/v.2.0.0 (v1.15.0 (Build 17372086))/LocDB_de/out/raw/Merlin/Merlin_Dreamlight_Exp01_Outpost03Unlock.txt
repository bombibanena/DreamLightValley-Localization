{PlayerName}, I see you've found another <Lore>mysterious Time Rift</Lore>. This too is connected to the magic of your Hourglass.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Channel the magical <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> within it to mend this wound in time and space...

TAG: Merlin_008_f
When you do, you can explore another area of Ancient's Landing... the <Lore>Overlook</Lore>!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll channel the magic of the Hourglass... (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyMist" index=0>)

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'm not quite ready yet...

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Marvelous! Soon, you'll be exploring the Overlook! I suspect there are ancient mysteries to be found there.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Goodness, I'm afraid you don't have enough <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> to mend this Time Rift yet.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Remember... the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> is <Lore>connected to the magic of your Hourglass and to Eternity Isle itself</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
You must keep uncovering wonders with your Hourglass and continue to make Eternity Isle a home. As you do, you'll gain the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> required!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Yes, yes... But don't take too long. There is much to discover!

TAG: Merlin_003_f
These <Lore>Time Rifts</Lore> are quite curious.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Why, they, er... they seem to be places where time and space have broken.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
It's some kind of tear in the fabric of space and time, and it's preventing us from exploring more of Eternity Isle.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
How do we fix it?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
So you're telling me I SHOULDN'T jump into it?

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Perhaps there's some way to fix this. But I'm afraid, for now, this requires more research...

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Well, that depends. Are you eager to be completely rearranged at a molecular level?

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Er... no.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
It does sound intriguing.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Hmm... are you sure?

TAG: Merlin_015_f
It could be a marvelous learning opportunity. Though I suppose the risks are significant...

TAG: Merlin_014_f
Doesn't it?!
