Everything in Dreamlight Valley is made of, well, <Lore>Dreamlight</Lore>!

TAG: Merlin_014_f
It's the sparkles you see over everything and everyone... even a wizard such as myself!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
But <Lore>Dreamlight</Lore> became scarcer and scarcer as the Forgetting fell over the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Ever since you arrived, though, the magic has started to come back!

TAG: Player_000_f
The magic is connected to me?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I have to use it wisely.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I want to make it stronger.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I don't feel very magical...

TAG: Merlin_007_f
And as long as you keep that wish in your heart, you need not fear.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
<Lore>Dreamlight Magic</Lore> grows stronger through <Lore>acts of friendship, love, and care</Lore>. Simple acts, like removing Night Thorns or forging a friendship with me.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Gaze into the Well, and you'll discover the different tasks that will create more <Lore>Dreamlight</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_000_f
And since you already found all the <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem>, the Wishing Well is reacting to your newfound powers!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
But we should start simply. <Lore>Look into the Well</Lore> to find out what the Valley needs.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Even the simplest tasks will bring great change and help end the Forgetting...

TAG: Merlin_023_f
...as long as they're done in the spirit of friendship, love, and care.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Now, once you've gathered enough Dreamlight to remove those horrid Night Thorns from the Castle, come find me again.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
But to fully embrace the potential of Dreamlight, you'll need to gather the <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem> that were lost during the Forgetting.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Remember: For some wizards, magic requires magical implements. You'll need those tools to save Dreamlight Valley.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Let's see... fishing... fishing... Ah yes! Goofy is very fond of fishing! He's sure to know where you can find the lost <Lore>Fishing Rod</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Though, I haven't heard from him since the stones blocked our path to the <Lore>Meadow to the south</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Well, you must find him, so I'd start there.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Mickey's been the gardener in the Village since the Forgetting. Perhaps he knows the whereabouts of the <Lore>Watering Can</Lore> and the <Lore>Shovel</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_021_f
All right. But it's not through the desire for power that the magic grows.

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Oh, it's not all about magic words and casting spells, you know.
