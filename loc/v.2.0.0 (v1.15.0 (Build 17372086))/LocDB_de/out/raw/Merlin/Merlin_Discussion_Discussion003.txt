Have you ever considered being a squirrel?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Sounds fun!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Sounds dangerous.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Can you do that?

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Well, I suppose the leaping about can be a bit fun at first, but a squirrel's life is hazardous.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Downright dangerous, even!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Almost all the world is larger than the creature, and a good portion wants to eat it!

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Now, what do you think we can learn from a squirrel?

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
Empathy for the vulnerable.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
How to survive.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Walnuts are good.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Yes, yes. That is a noble lesson to learn. What a promising thought.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
A practical and important lesson indeed. When life is hard, we must find ways to carry on.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
I suppose that's technically true, but not really what I was driving at.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Indeed it is! The squirrel is a tiny creature with enormous problems!

TAG: Merlin_010_f
How it's survived throughout the ages is one of nature's big mysteries.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
I could. Though I won't; not now. We have other things to do.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
But I still encourage you to CONSIDER being a squirrel. Think about it...

TAG: Merlin_004_f
The squirrel's life is hazardous. Downright dangerous!
