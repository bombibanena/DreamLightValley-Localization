{PlayerName}, have you spent much time feeding the creatures around the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Oh yes!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
A little bit. But I should do it more.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Every time I get close, they run or hide!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Wonderful! We must remember that the Valley has quite a peculiar ecosystem.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
The tiniest creatures are of vital importance... even if we don't quite understand how yet.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Well, heed my advice. I've been observing them closely for quite some time.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Some of these small animals are timid, while others are more friendly and playful.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
If you're ever in doubt... just stand utterly still and observe them.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
In fact, that's not terrible advice for life in general...
