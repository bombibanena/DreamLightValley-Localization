{PlayerName}, do you know the distinction between Dark and Light Magic?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I do.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I don't.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
So, you already understand the nature of magic? Very good.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Now tell me: Which calls to you? Light Magic or Dark Magic?

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Light.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Dark.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Both.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Light Magic. An altruistic choice. And one that will serve you well in your quest to restore the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Dark Magic can be powerful and compelling, but must be managed carefully.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
A wise answer. Balance is difficult, but important.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
It's a simple difference, really. Light Magic is performed for others.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
Dark Magic is performed for yourself. Dark Magic is not necessarily evil, but is more easily turned to evil.
