{PlayerName}, I see you've found another <Lore>mysterious Time Rift</Lore>. This too is connected to the magic of your Hourglass.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Channel the magical <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> within it to mend this wound in time and space...

TAG: Merlin_010_f
When you do, you can explore another area of Ancient's Landing... the <Lore>Ruins</Lore>!

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'll channel the magic of the Hourglass... (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyMist" index=0>)

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'm not quite ready yet...

TAG: Merlin_011_f
{PlayerName}, you've gained entry to the Ruins! These old stones have many stories to share with us. But only you can uncover them.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Dash it all! I'm afraid you don't have enough <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> to mend this Time Rift.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
Remember... the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> is <Lore>connected to the magic of your Hourglass and to Eternity Isle itself</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
You must keep uncovering wonders with your Hourglass and continue to make Eternity Isle a home. As you do, you'll gain the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> required!

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Oh? Well, I suppose that's all right. But don't tarry! There is much to explore.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
These <Lore>Time Rifts</Lore> are quite curious.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Why, they, er... they seem to be places where time and space have broken.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Perhaps there's some way to fix this. But I'm afraid, for now, this requires more research...
