A fine selection of mystical flora! Excellent work, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
Now, I will weave these into an enchantment for your Watering Can.

If all goes well, you can then obliterate some rather bothersome Mushrooms entirely and instantly.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can this magic be used to prevent Night Thorns from growing?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
What's wrong with those Mushrooms?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Is this safe?

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Very perceptive. THAT is something we can hope to work towards.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
But don't use this enchantment on the Night Thorns yet.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
It won't have any effect on magical plants. We should start with the Mushrooms.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Oh, this is mostly a test to see if the enchantment works.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
But also, I rather dislike how they smell.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
So this will be useful on two fronts: a magical test and landscaping.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
As safe as anything is, my friend.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
Which is to say: Possibly not at all.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
But we must accept what risks come with the adventure that is life.
