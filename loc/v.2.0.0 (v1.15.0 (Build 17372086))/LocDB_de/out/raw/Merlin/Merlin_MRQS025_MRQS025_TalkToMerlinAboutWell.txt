Did you just say Sea Witch?

TAG: Merlin_000_f
Stupendous! You succeeded! The Well is free of the curse!

TAG: Merlin_001_f
You know, the Old Ruler used the Wells to <Lore>travel by magic</Lore> around the Village from Well to Well.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I prefer to wander!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I like to get where I'm going, fast.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Traveling by magic... sounds risky.

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Indeed! Wandering is when I think my best thoughts. But you can always use the Wells when you need to get somewhere fast.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
Speaking of wandering: Replacing the <ActivityItem>Orb of Friendship</ActivityItem> removed the Dark Magic from the Giant Night Thorns blocking the way to the rest of the Valley.

TAG: Merlin_003_f
If you gather enough Dreamlight, you can get rid of the Giant Night Thorns to <Lore>explore farther</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_007_f
And in time, we should be able to discover what happened to the others who stayed behind.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
I seem to remember that when the Valley fell to chaos, <Lore>the Sea Witch</Lore> stayed by the beach.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
Sounds scary.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
Sounds like my kind of lady.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Sounds like a good place to start.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
Yes, you should be wary of her. She can be a bit... tricky.

TAG: Merlin_005_f
The Sea Witch may hold many of the answers we seek. I suggest you start by exploring the beaches to the south.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Well, she can be a bit... tricky, but on occasion she proves to be of use.

TAG: Merlin_012_f
A shrewd observation, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Then you'll no doubt find the Wells around the Village useful! But don't forget to take time to wander now and then. You never know what mysteries you might uncover.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Not at all! Just remember to take time to wander now and then. You never know what mysteries you might uncover.
