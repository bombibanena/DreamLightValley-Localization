{PlayerName}, some Villagers are getting worried.

TAG: Merlin_002_f
You see, our memories are getting clouded. We fear the Forgetting may be happening again.

TAG: Merlin_015_f
Oh, what a big magical mess this all is!

TAG: Player_000_f
It's the doing of some sort of Dark Entity. It...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
...cursed a cave.

TAG: Player_000_choice_004_f
...vanished through a portal.

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
...imprisoned Ursula in a cave.

TAG: Merlin_018_f
Ah, so it's a Dark Entity that's causing all these curses...

TAG: Merlin_000_f
If we're to stop the Forgetting from happening again, we must fully understand the situation! The what, the who, and the how!

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Where do I start?

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I can't do it alone.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'll NEVER let it happen again!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
There are a few caves tucked away on the Beach. You must explore them.

TAG: Merlin_013_f
The cave Ursula mentioned is enshrined in legend. It's called the <Lore>Mystical Cave</Lore>. Once, it was a source of great power.

TAG: Merlin_017_f
Find the cave, and help the Sea Witch. She always has secrets she's willing to trade for a deal.

TAG: Merlin_004_f
When the Valley fell into chaos, the Sea Witch fled to a cave by the sea.

TAG: Merlin_001_f
She must be in the one you saw on the north side of the Beach.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
Investigate that cave and find her. If there's one thing I know about Ursula, it's that she always has secrets she's willing to trade to make a deal.

TAG: Merlin_014_f
And you won't! The whole Village is with you, but there's one person in particular that you must find.

TAG: Merlin_019_f
Someone who understands power and magic quite well...

TAG: Merlin_021_f
Ursula, the Sea Witch.

TAG: Merlin_020_f
I know you won't! And it's exactly that kind of conviction we need.

TAG: Merlin_016_f
Because sometimes you must trust the untrustworthy...

TAG: Merlin_022_f
Oh, blast it all! A Dark Entity moving through portals. That must be why the curses appear in so many places.

TAG: Merlin_023_f
This Dark Entity must be quite powerful to manage such a thing.
