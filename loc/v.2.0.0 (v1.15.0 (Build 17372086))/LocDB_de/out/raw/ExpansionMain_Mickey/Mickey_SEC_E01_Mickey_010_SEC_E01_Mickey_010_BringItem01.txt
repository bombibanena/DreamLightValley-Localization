Here you go, Mickey! I got those flowers you asked for!

TAG: Mickey_001_f
Aw, thanks, pal!

TAG: Mickey_002_f
Hmm... hold on... There's something funny about these.

TAG: Mickey_004_f
The blue one... is it made outta glass?!

TAG: Mickey_006_f
And the green one... it seems more like a pet than a house plant!

TAG: Mickey_003_f
A lot of dangerous magic was running wild on Eternity Isle. I guess it made these flowers a bit... weird.

TAG: Mickey_007_f
Gosh, I don't know if Minnie would like any of these much.

TAG: Mickey_008_f
She had enough trouble with magic during her time in the Here and There.

TAG: Mickey_010_f
Sorry I asked you to do all that, {PlayerName}. Do ya think since these flowers seem so magical that there's somebody else who could use 'em for somethin'?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'll bring them to Merlin. He can use them for his experiments.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll bring them to Ursula. She can use them for her potions.

TAG: Mickey_011_f
That's a great idea! I bet Merlin would love to take a look at these.

TAG: Mickey_013_f
Thanks for helping, {PlayerName}, even if it didn't turn out exactly how we planned. Next time, I'll stick to petunias.

TAG: Mickey_012_f
You sure about that, pal? What if she uses 'em to make somethin' dangerous?

TAG: Mickey_014_f
Whatever Ursula wants to use them for, she'll be in my debt. That's useful.

TAG: Mickey_015_f
Huh. Guess I'll have to trust you on that.

TAG: Mickey_009_f
And I wouldn't wanna risk upsetting her right after she gets back.
