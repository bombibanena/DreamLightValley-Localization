Ah, {PlayerName}. You were so instrumental in making the Sunlit Plateau whole again that I really must thank you.

Let's share a meal together in my den â ruler and ruler.

TAG: Player_000_choice_003_f
That's so unlike you... but okay!

TAG: Player_000_choice_005_f
Maybe some other time.

TAG: Scar_004_f
What can I say? I'm just full of surprises...

TAG: Scar_001_f
There is, however, the small matter of food...

TAG: Scar_011_f
I took the liberty of asking the rodent to provide us with meals fit for the occasion. He gave me these odd things. Here.

TAG: Scar_012_f
Recipes for <ActivityItem>Teriyaki Salmon</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Gooseberry Pie</ActivityItem>? Hm, okay.

TAG: Player_000_choice_006_f
I'm looking forward to this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_007_f
This seems a little suspicious.

TAG: Player_000_choice_008_f
Scar, this better not be some kind of scheme.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Oh, believe me, {PlayerName}, you couldn't be awaiting it any more eagerly than I. Heh-heh-heh...

TAG: Scar_007_f
What? {PlayerName}, you wound me.

TAG: Scar_008_f
I wouldn't dream of trying to trick you.

TAG: Scar_002_f
Of course, {PlayerName}. But do come visit again soon.
