Ahh... I see you've brought life back to my kingdom.

TAG: Scar_004_f
And not a moment too soon. I'm simply famished.

TAG: Scar_003_f
Frankly, I didn't think you'd be able to manage it, even with my guidance.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I didn't think so either...

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I've handled bigger problems.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Don't underestimate me, Scar.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Well, as long as you listen closely and follow my every instruction, we'll each get what we want.

TAG: Scar_017_f
I suppose there's enough room in this Valley for both of us, {PlayerName}... as long as you remember one thing.

TAG: Scar_001_f
The Sunlit Plateau is MY kingdom. And no one else's.

TAG: Scar_016_f
Do not forget it.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Yes, it's clear you have some competencies, unlike a certain white-maned windbag... or a rather inconvenient nephew of mine, wherever he may be...

TAG: Scar_018_f
Is that a threat? Perhaps I'm inspiring you, {PlayerName}.

TAG: Scar_019_f
You may learn how to be a competent ruler yet.
