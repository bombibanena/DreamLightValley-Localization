Oh, {PlayerName}, it's you. *yawn* ... What do you want now?

TAG: Scar_011_f
Simba wants to remember more about his past in the Valley. You were mostly protected from the Forgetting in your cave. What do you remember?

TAG: Scar_003_f
Oh, so much. So much, in fact, that Simba will probably wish I didn't. Now, let's see...

TAG: Scar_006_f
Oh, yes. Before the Forgetting, you put Simba in charge of protecting the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree</ActivityItem>. It was a haven for all the scrumptious... er... fragile creatures around the Valley.

TAG: Scar_007_f
But then, the Night Thorns came. And instead of staying and doing what he was supposed to...

TAG: Scar_001_f
...Simba ran away, back to Pride Rock. And the Dreamlight Tree withered.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
There must be a way to fix this.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
So there's nothing to be done?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
And you just stood there and let it wither?

TAG: Scar_002_f
Perhaps...

TAG: Scar_005_f
Only you can fix my nephew's mistake... Oh, but that's right. You don't remember either.

TAG: Scar_017_f
You don't remember the <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seeds</ActivityItem> that sprout into more trees. Of course, you stopped anyone from ever finding them.

TAG: Scar_010_f
It's like you don't trust anyone... not even me.

TAG: Scar_013_f
Don't trust anyone...? These <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seeds</ActivityItem> must be something special if I felt like I had to hide them. Where are they?

TAG: Scar_014_f
In the Mines below the Sunlit Plateau. You hid them in a very secret room. Let's hope, for everyone's sake, you manage to find them.

TAG: Scar_016_f
Well, there are more <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Tree Seeds</ActivityItem>. But you stopped anyone from ever finding them.

TAG: Scar_004_f
Well, I would have done something, but YOU ensured I couldn't.
