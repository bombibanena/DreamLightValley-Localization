Ugh. I'm surrounded by fools.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm sorry?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Are you calling me a fool?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
It takes a fool to know a fool...

TAG: Scar_004_f
To be fair, you're only half a fool, {PlayerName}. After all, you did half the job.

TAG: Scar_000_f
You've managed to get rid of the smallest bones. But the largest ones are still there, cleaving the Sunlit Plateau in two.

TAG: Scar_007_f
I suppose it'll have to do. For now.

TAG: Scar_002_f
But I won't be satisfied ruling over only half my kingdom for long.

TAG: Scar_005_f
I'm calling you half a fool, {PlayerName}. You left the job half done.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Ah, it's a battle of wits you're after now, is it? Be glad you're only half a fool, {PlayerName}. It makes your company somewhat palatable.
