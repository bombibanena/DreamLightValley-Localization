Well, {PlayerName}, your neighbors have earned a respite from my carnivorous appetite.

You should consider being nicer to people...

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They could become your friends.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They'd be nicer to you.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
They'll be easier to manipulate.

TAG: Scar_001_f
Friends? Please. Friends are for simpering, needy over-sharers.

TAG: Scar_002_f
I don't want nice. I want obedience and respect!

TAG: Scar_003_f
Not in my experience. The only way to get someone to obey is to be sure they properly fear you.
