Enjoy, {PlayerName}...

TAG: Scar_001_f
Argh! Nothing!

TAG: Scar_002_f
Once again, I'm denied what's mine!

TAG: Scar_003_f
It should have worked! Where is it?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Uh... what's going on?

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I KNEW IT! You were plotting something!

TAG: Scar_004_f
You still haven't figured it out, have you? I had an ulterior motive for inviting you here.

TAG: Scar_005_f
No point in avoiding it now...

TAG: Scar_007_f
There's a... trinket I've been looking for.

TAG: Scar_008_f
You hid it from me, long ago. Another one of your lessons.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I did that?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Doesn't sound like me...

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Are you sure you haven't just lost it?

TAG: Scar_009_f
Before you left the first time. You wanted to teach me a lesson...

TAG: Scar_012_f
*sigh* You said...

TAG: Scar_018_f
<Lore>"Good rulers care for everyone, from the tallest to the smallest. They invite everyone to the table."</Lore>

TAG: Scar_013_f
You told me that my stolen trinket would be returned when I understood the meaning of those words.

TAG: Scar_014_f
I hoped if we shared a meal, it would break your silly little curse. But I was wrong...

TAG: Scar_019_f
I'm going to talk to Merlin. He probably helped me cast the enchantment. Maybe he can help me break it.

TAG: Scar_016_f
That old windbag does delight in being a know-it-all.

TAG: Scar_010_f
You still don't remember, do you? You stole it from me to teach me a lesson...

TAG: Scar_011_f
No! Unlike you, I remember when you stole it from me. You wanted to teach me a lesson...

TAG: Scar_006_f
*sigh* Yes, {PlayerName}, how astute. You've ascertained my ulterior motive. Very good.
