Finally! Watching over my territory will be so much easier now...

TAG: Scar_010_f
You see, {PlayerName}, I found this little piece of glass in the Valley long ago. With it, I can see whatever I want without going anywhere...

TAG: Scar_011_f
And it ensures I'm still the most ferocious lion in all the Valley.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
I'm glad you have it back.

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
It sounds very useful.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
So what I'm hearing is that you're lazy AND insecure...

TAG: Scar_012_f
Not as much as I am, I assure you...

TAG: Scar_005_f
Here. I wanted to give you this. As a token of gratitude. After all, you helped me more than any of those other fools ever did.

TAG: Scar_006_f
Thanks to you, I have my whole land to roam. And now I've even been reunited with my most valuable tool.

TAG: Scar_007_f
Tell me, mirror...

TAG: Scar_001_f
Who's the most cunning lion of them all?

TAG: Scar_013_f
Oh, yes, {PlayerName}. A king must always be prepared.

TAG: Scar_014_f
On the contrary; it's called "being prepared."

TAG: Scar_015_f
Now...
