{PlayerName}, why don't the fools around here respect my natural superiority?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
What makes YOU so superior?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
People don't recognize your brilliance.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Maybe it's because you're a jerk to everyone.

TAG: Scar_001_f
Well, I am at the top of the food chain. And of course, there's my cunning and brilliance.

TAG: Scar_004_f
If only I were given what I deserve, life here would be sublime.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
What do you think you deserve?

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
Are you sure?

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
That sounds reasonable.

TAG: Scar_005_f
Respect...

TAG: Scar_006_f
Admiration...

TAG: Scar_007_f
And to be made king of all I survey.

TAG: Scar_008_f
Everyone would benefit. I assure you.

TAG: Scar_009_f
Of course. When I have what is rightfully mine...

TAG: Scar_010_f
...all will be as it should be.

TAG: Scar_011_f
Of course it does. I'm never wrong.

TAG: Scar_002_f
They don't, and it's such a tragedy. A loss to the entire community.

TAG: Scar_003_f
If I'm uncivil, it's because I'm not appreciated.
