Hello.

TAG: WallE_004_f
I've found another Memory using that mysterious machine!

TAG: WallE_007_f
It shows you and a group of people watching the stars...

TAG: WallE_005_f
Ooooh...

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Were you researching the stars?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Were you stargazing for fun?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Were you looking for EVE?

TAG: WallE_011_f
No.

TAG: WallE_015_f
Not that then? Maybe more for fun?

TAG: WallE_016_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_017_f
That sounds awesome! Do you want to get your club back together?

TAG: WallE_018_f
Wow!

TAG: WallE_019_f
Merlin was in the Memory! We can start with him.

TAG: WallE_012_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_013_f
EVE-ah? EEEEEEVE-ah!

TAG: WallE_020_f
Hah. You sure like her.

TAG: WallE_021_f
You probably weren't searching the stars for her, though.

TAG: WallE_022_f
Since this was before the Forgetting, she'd have been here.

TAG: WallE_023_f
EVE-ah...
