The machine is fixed!

TAG: WallE_000_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_001_f
So we fixed the machine, but I still don't know what it does.

TAG: WallE_002_f
WALLÂ·E! WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_016_f
Ha! You're raising your hand like we're in school. You know what it does?

TAG: WallE_017_f
*whistle*

TAG: Player_003_choice_000_f
Is it a machine that makes Memories?

TAG: Player_003_choice_001_f
Is it a machine that breaks things?

TAG: Player_003_choice_002_f
Is it a machine that finds Memories?!

TAG: WallE_006_f
No.

TAG: WallE_004_f
Not that? Well...

TAG: WallE_003_f
*whistle*

TAG: WallE_005_f
I see! So this machine is probably the reason that the Memory appeared!

TAG: WallE_007_f
And the Memory was broken because the machine was broken.

TAG: WallE_008_f
Now that we've repaired it, I wonder if more Memories will appear.
