Ahh... ooh... Whoa!

TAG: WallE_001_f
What's got you so excited, WALLÂ·E?

TAG: WallE_002_f
Ah... ah... ah!

TAG: WallE_003_f
The sky...? Oh, the stars!

TAG: WallE_004_f
You're looking at all the constellations up there.

TAG: WallE_005_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
They're beautiful.

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
They're so cool.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Eh, they're just big balls of gas in the sky.

*whistle*

TAG: WallE_007_f
There's something funny about them, though. I swear they seem to change sometimes.

TAG: WallE_008_f
New ones seem to always be appearing out of nowhere. I guess I'll have to keep my eyes on the skies.

*sigh*

TAG: WallE_010_f
Wow!
