Ah, {PlayerName}! I have some rather exciting news to share with you!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Now then, have you noticed the curious islands floating above the Valley?

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Yes, what about them?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
No... But go on!

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I've been WAITING for this day!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
I believe I've found a way for us to visit them at last!

TAG: Merlin_009_f
Using magical calculations, I've connected the islands to our <Lore>Wishing Wells</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_010_f
So, if we <Lore>go to any of the Wishing Wells, we'll activate the travel enchantment</Lore>. Then we can <Lore>visit the first island</Lore>.

TAG: Merlin_011_f
Let us embark on this journey of discovery together!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Well, these Floating Islands have long been suspended in our sky, unreachable by magic or flying machine!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
Heh-heh. Your astute sense of observation is quite refreshing, you know.

TAG: Merlin_008_f
As you've duly noted, the Floating Islands have long hovered over the Valley, out of reach.
