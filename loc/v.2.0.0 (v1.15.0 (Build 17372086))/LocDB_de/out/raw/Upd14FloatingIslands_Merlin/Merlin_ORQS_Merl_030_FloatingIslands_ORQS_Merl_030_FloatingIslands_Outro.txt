Marvelous, {PlayerName}! I cannot wait to finally get in some quiet study on the Plaza Floating Island!

Now remember, there are additional Floating Islands that mirror the other Biomes of the Valley.

With enough <Lore>Dreamlight</Lore>, you can access them all to decorate however you please. Your imagination is the only limit!

I'm going to make my own theme park!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
I'll make a domain for the Villains.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
I've got TOO many plans for this space!

TAG: Merlin_005_f
Really? Well, heh-heh, I certainly look forward to that!

Don't forget: If you want to return to the Valley proper, <Lore>use the Wishing Well</Lore>.

I'll leave you to it! Farewell!

TAG: Merlin_004_f
Well, I'm sure they will certainly enjoy a place to freely wreak havoc... And the rest of us will most definitely enjoy the respite from their schemes!

TAG: Merlin_006_f
Pah! There's no such thing as too many plans, my friend!

TAG: Merlin_007_f
I cannot wait to see what you create with so much open space at your disposal!
