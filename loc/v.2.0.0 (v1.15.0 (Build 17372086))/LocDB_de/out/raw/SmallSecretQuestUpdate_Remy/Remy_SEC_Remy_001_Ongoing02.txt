...might I suggest <ActivityItem>Bouillabaisse</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Remy_002_f
You'll need <ActivityItem>Shrimp</ActivityItem>, and two other kinds of <ActivityItem>Seafood</ActivityItem>. Your choice. A <ActivityItem>Tomato</ActivityItem>, and another <ActivityItem>Vegetable</ActivityItem>. Again, your choice.

You oughta be able to find most of what you need on Dazzle Beach.

TAG: Remy_013_f
But I think you're gonna need to get to Dazzle Beach to find <ActivityItem>Shrimp</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Tomatoes</ActivityItem>. It's still blocked off by those Giant Night Thorns, isn't it?

TAG: Remy_003_f
What about <ActivityItem>Potato Leek Soup</ActivityItem>?

TAG: Remy_004_f
It's a simple recipe. You'll need <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>, an <ActivityItem>Onion</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Garlic</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_006_f
Oh! And obviously a <ActivityItem>Potato</ActivityItem> and a <ActivityItem>Leek</ActivityItem>!

TAG: Remy_014_f
You should be able to find those in the Forgotten Lands.

TAG: Remy_015_f
All of that used to grow in the Forgotten Lands. But that place is still blocked by Giant Night Thorns.

You can't go wrong with a <ActivityItem>Tuna Burger</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_008_f
You'll need a little <ActivityItem>Tuna</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Onion</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem> to start.

TAG: Remy_009_f
Then you'll need a <ActivityItem>Lemon</ActivityItem> for zest, and a <ActivityItem>Vegetable</ActivityItem> of your choice for some added crunch.

TAG: Remy_016_f
I think you can find <ActivityItem>Tuna</ActivityItem> if you fish around Dazzle Beach.

TAG: Remy_017_f
But I think you're gonna need to get to Dazzle Beach to find <ActivityItem>Tuna</ActivityItem>. It's still blocked off by those Giant Night Thorns, isn't it?

TAG: Remy_010_f
I recommend a <ActivityItem>Large Seafood Platter</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_011_f
You'll need four types of <ActivityItem>Seafood</ActivityItem>. Your choice. And a <ActivityItem>Lemon</ActivityItem> to give it an extra bit of zing!

TAG: Remy_018_f
Dazzle Beach is a great place to go for fresh <ActivityItem>Seafood</ActivityItem>.

TAG: Remy_019_f
But I think you're gonna need to get to Dazzle Beach to find more <ActivityItem>Seafood</ActivityItem> first. It's still blocked off by those Giant Night Thorns, isn't it?
