Yes! My <ActivityItem>Bag of Ingredients</ActivityItem>! I thought I'd never get this back.

TAG: Remy_001_f
I had a little... misunderstanding... with one of the raccoons in the Forest of Valor.

TAG: Remy_002_f
He grabbed the bag and ran off. I thought I'd never get to finish my errands.

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
Can I help you with your errands?

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
You're lucky the raccoon didn't eat it all.

TAG: Player_000_choice_002_f
Note to self: Don't mess with raccoons.

TAG: Remy_003_f
Actually, now that you mention it...

TAG: Remy_004_f
...I could really use your help.

TAG: Remy_005_f
What do you need?

TAG: Remy_006_f
Well, these were Ingredients for some special deliveries.

TAG: Remy_007_f
I wanted to make meals to thank everyone who stayed behind to take care of the Valley during the Forgetting.

TAG: Player_001_choice_000_f
That's thoughtful!

TAG: Player_001_choice_001_f
I'd love to help however I can.

TAG: Player_001_choice_002_f
Hope you've got a thank-you dessert planned for me...

TAG: Remy_008_f
Aw, thanks. I figured it was the least I could do after Mickey took care of my recipes. There's only one problem...

TAG: Remy_009_f
I've been pretty busy with the restaurant. So I haven't had time to cook all the meals I had planned.

TAG: Remy_010_f
If I gave you these Ingredients... do you think you could finish <Lore>making some meals for Merlin, Mickey, Mr. McDuck, and Goofy</Lore>?

TAG: Remy_011_f
You've been a pretty great sous chef in the past.

TAG: Player_002_choice_000_f
Of course! I'd be honored to help.

TAG: Player_002_choice_001_f
I'm sure I could whip something up for them.

TAG: Player_002_choice_002_f
I'll put it on the bottom of my increasingly long to-do list...

TAG: Remy_012_f
Thanks, {PlayerName}. I really appreciate it.

TAG: Remy_013_f
Here, take the Ingredients. Just make sure to <Lore>cook them fresh</Lore>. And they've definitely got to be <Lore>5 Stars</Lore>!

TAG: Remy_014_f
Come talk to me if you need any help thinking of meals.

TAG: Remy_015_f
I know you can. You're a great cook.

TAG: Remy_016_f
I get it. There's no rush, but I'm sure they'll appreciate the gesture.

TAG: Remy_017_f
I really appreciate it. My little "thank you" isn't going so well.

TAG: Remy_018_f
Don't worry, {PlayerName}. I've definitely got something in mind for you. Just haven't gotten around to making it yet.

TAG: Remy_019_f
I'll say. It would've been a huge waste if Ingredients like these were eaten before they could be transformed into spectacular dishes.

TAG: Remy_020_f
Oh, hey, and speaking of cooking all this...

TAG: Remy_021_f
Ha! No kidding. I, for one, have learned my lesson.

TAG: Remy_022_f
But say, now that you're here...
