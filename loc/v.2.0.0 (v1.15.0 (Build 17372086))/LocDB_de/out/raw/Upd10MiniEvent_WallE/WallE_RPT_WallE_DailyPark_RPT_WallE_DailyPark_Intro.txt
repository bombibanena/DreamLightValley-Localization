Hi WALLÂ·E!

TAG: WallE_022_f
WALLÂ·E!

TAG: Player_000_choice_000_f
I'm happy to see you!

TAG: Player_000_choice_001_f
Gotta go; I'm busy.

TAG: WallE_011_f
Hey, WALLÂ·E! I was thinking about making some more <ActivityItem>Spaceship Earth Cupcakes</ActivityItem> to hand out for the festival.

TAG: WallE_012_f
Ee-ah... Earth!

TAG: WallE_013_f
I'll bake them up and go hand them out to the Villagers.

TAG: WallE_014_f
You can tell me if they look ready to be handed out.

TAG: WallE_015_f
Directive!

TAG: WallE_016_f
Dir-ec-tive!

TAG: WallE_017_f
Sounds like you've got something you want me to do.

TAG: WallE_018_f
Ta-da! *holds up cupcake wrapper*

TAG: WallE_019_f
Ohh! You want some cupcakes? I'm guessing to give away to the Villagers since you don't eat...

TAG: WallE_020_f
*affirmative whistle*

TAG: WallE_001_f
Happy Dreamlight Parks Fest! Are you having a good time?

TAG: WallE_010_f
Whoopee!

TAG: WallE_002_f
Uh... Directive?

TAG: WallE_003_f
Well, the directive for the festival is to have fun!

TAG: WallE_004_f
Collect popcorn buckets, decorate...

TAG: WallE_005_f
Bake special cupcakes and give them to other Villagers...

TAG: WallE_006_f
Ah! Directive! *excited beeps*

TAG: WallE_007_f
You want to give out cupcakes?

TAG: WallE_008_f
*affirmative whistle*

TAG: WallE_009_f
Huh, okay! I can make you some <ActivityItem>Spaceship Earth Cupcakes</ActivityItem>. Maybe we can give them to the members of your Astronomy Club?

TAG: WallE_021_f
Aw...
