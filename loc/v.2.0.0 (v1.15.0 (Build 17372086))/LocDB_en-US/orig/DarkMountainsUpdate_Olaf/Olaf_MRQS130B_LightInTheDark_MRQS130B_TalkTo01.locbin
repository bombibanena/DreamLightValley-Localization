Olaf_004_fÄ{PlayerName}, I'm so glad you're here! I don't want to alarm you, but I've noticed that the Village seems to be... er... broken.
^

Olaf_022_fPThe sky looks angry. Unfortunately, my arms aren't long enough to give it a hug.
H
Player_000_choice_000_f-I was hoping you could help me with all that.
@
Player_000_choice_001_f%Try not to worry about that too much.
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&But how would you even hug the sky...?

Olaf_007_fMe? Oh, I love to help!

Olaf_008_f"Wait... How am I supposed to help?
b

Olaf_005_fTI found a blanket in the secret chamber. I think it used to belong to the Forgotten.
,

Olaf_013_fDo you know anything about it?
m

Olaf_014_f_*gasp* The fuzzy, cuddly blanket! You found it! Hooray! ... But I don't know TOO much about it.
-

Olaf_015_fOoh! But I do know who might...
ë

Olaf_021_fÇElsa! I remember it from her room at the castle. Of course, she doesn't get cold, but I think she just likes being cozy sometimes.
M

Olaf_001_f?Elsa... So I'd need her to learn the story behind this blanket?
H

Olaf_023_f:Yep! But she went back to Arendelle during the Forgetting.
W

Olaf_024_fIOh, maybe you could find her behind one of the doors in the Dream Castle!
/

Olaf_025_f!I'd be so happy if Elsa was here!
â

Olaf_026_f{Thanks, Olaf. I'll have to <Lore>bring Elsa back to the Village</Lore> if we're to have any hope of stopping the Forgotten.
q

Olaf_016_fcAnd in the meantime, I'll just find and categorize all the different kinds of rocks in the Village.
&
Player_001_choice_000_fGreat plan!

Player_001_choice_001_f
Um... why?


Olaf_018_fI thought so!
V

Olaf_017_fHI'm calling it "controlling what I can when things feel out of control."
<

Olaf_002_f.She has to know the story behind that blanket!
Ç

Olaf_027_ftThanks, Olaf. I guess I'll have to go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore> if we're to have any hope of stopping the Forgotten.
^

Olaf_009_fPI did think it was something for the oldest and wisest in the Village to handle.
:

Olaf_012_f,That's true. But you could help me, I think.
A

Olaf_010_f3No idea! But it's on my list of things to research.

Olaf_000_fOIs there anything else I could do to help until I find a sky-hugging technique?
