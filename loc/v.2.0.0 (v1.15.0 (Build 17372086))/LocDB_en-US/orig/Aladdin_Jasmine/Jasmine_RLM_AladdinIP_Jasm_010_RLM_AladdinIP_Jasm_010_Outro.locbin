Player_000_choice_003_fLet's get to work!
†
Jasmine_003_fuThere's still a lot of work to do in Agrabah, but now that there's three of us, I feel much better about our chances.
F
Jasmine_000_f5Hey Jasmine, can I ask you a question? Where's Genie?
=
Jasmine_001_f,How come he's not helping you with all this?
b
Jasmine_009_fQUnfortunately, he's still traveling. And we have no way to get in touch with him.
B
Jasmine_013_f1Well, hopefully I can help a little in his place.
t
Jasmine_004_fcI'm not going to stop until Agrabah is back to normal and you two feel safe leaving the city as-is.
 
Jasmine_005_fSo what's next?
Æ
Jasmine_006_f´Well, we have to rescue the Magic Carpet as quickly as we can, then there are repairs needed in the marketplace, and of course, we need to figure out how to disable the Windcaller.
R
Jasmine_007_fAOh, he got stuck in a flurry of winds surrounding the Windcaller.
^
Jasmine_008_fMThe winds there are so intense that poor Carpet hasn't been able to get free.
P
Jasmine_010_f?We need to figure out a way to quell the winds and get him out.

Jasmine_020_f"Sounds tricky, but we can do this!
Œ
Jasmine_019_f{Yes! Now why don't you <Lore>talk to Aladdin</Lore>? I am sure he has some ideas about what we need to do to rescue Carpet.
/
Jasmine_011_fTo put it simply, it's a mess.
^
Jasmine_012_fMMost of the market stalls are broken, and some are covered in ruined produce.
F
Jasmine_014_f5Then there's the fountain. We never got to finish it.
N
Jasmine_015_f=As I said, we found it locked away in a vault under the city.
v
Jasmine_016_feI suppose that means that people in the past had to deal with it too. We just need to figure out how!
m
Jasmine_017_f\If you and Aladdin <Lore>look in the South Market</Lore> for a clue, I'll keep looking here.

Jasmine_018_f%Hopefully, one of us can find a lead.
