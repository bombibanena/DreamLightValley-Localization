Jasmine_007_f {PlayerName}? Are you all right?
_
Jasmine_008_fNI know what this is... This is MY journal... I wrote in it when I was younger.

Player_000_choice_000_fI can't believe it!

Player_000_choice_001_f I had a feeling this was mine...

Player_000_choice_002_fDid you know?

Jasmine_010_f%I completely forgot about this thing.
N
Jasmine_014_f=So all this time, it was YOUR secret I was trying to protect?
P
Jasmine_015_f?I guess so. You truly don't remember what the secret inside is?
#
Jasmine_019_fI'm sorry, but no.
p
Jasmine_020_f_I remember you asked for my help. Whatever you wrote in the journal, you wanted it hidden away.

Jasmine_004_fcLet me take some time to examine the Secret Journal a bit more. Maybe there's a hint we're missing.
c
Jasmine_005_fRThat's a good idea. Thanks for everything, Jasmine. We make a pretty amazing team.
'
Jasmine_022_fI'm sure you did, too.
w
Jasmine_023_ffKnowing you, that's not possible. I think this is less about what you did and more about how you felt.
C
Jasmine_011_f2How I felt when we first found it was so familiar.

Jasmine_012_f"No! I promise I couldn't remember.

Jasmine_013_foBut now that you've told me, bits and pieces are starting to come back. You asked me to hide it. To protect it.
