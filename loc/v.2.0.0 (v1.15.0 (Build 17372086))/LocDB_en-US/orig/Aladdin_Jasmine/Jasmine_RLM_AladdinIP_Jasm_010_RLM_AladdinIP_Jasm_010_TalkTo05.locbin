Jasmine_004_fgYou're right. I suppose being so close to the Windcaller, it was especially affected by the sandstorms.

Jasmine_005_f|I wanted to come here because the artisans in Agrabah make special tools to work the extremely hard stone found in the area.

Jasmine_006_f›We should be able to find ingots of a substance called <ActivityItem>Artisans' Alloy</ActivityItem> that's far harder and more durable than regular metals.
Ê
Jasmine_007_f¸That's great! If I find enough of that, I bet I can <Lore>upgrade my Royal Pickaxe</Lore> so it'll break down the sandstone barriers! Then, we'll really have a shot at finding Aladdin!
°
Jasmine_000_fžWonderful! Don't forget to <Lore>check chests in the area</Lore> â€” the alloy is a valuable metal so would have been placed somewhere secure for safekeeping.
