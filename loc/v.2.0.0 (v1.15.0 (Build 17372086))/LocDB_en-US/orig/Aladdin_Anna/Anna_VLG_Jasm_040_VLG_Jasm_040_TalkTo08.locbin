Jasmine_000_fyOh, thank you so much, {PlayerName}! I didn't want any of that chocolate going to waste, but I couldn't eat another bite.
V

Anna_000_fHEating chocolate to help a friend isn't such a bad way to spend my time.
H

Anna_001_f:Before you go, there's something else I wanted to mention.
)
Player_000_choice_000_fI'm listening.
+
Player_000_choice_001_fOh no, what now?
3
Player_000_choice_002_fIs there more chocolate?
N

Anna_006_f@I can't really explain this, but maybe you'll know what to do...
ó

Anna_002_fàOkay, so earlier today, even though I was completely freaked out about my chocolate dilemma, there WAS one person who could cheer me up.


Anna_009_fOh really? Who?
 

Anna_010_f... Mike Wazowski.
.
Player_001_choice_000_fHe IS pretty funny!

Player_001_choice_001_fThat's a little random.

Player_001_choice_002_fWhy is that so strange?

Anna_011_fOHe is, but the weird part is he was making me laugh even without telling jokes!
è

Anna_014_fÄThis definitely sounds like more wish magic causing havoc. I'll go <Lore>talk to Mike</Lore> and see what he wished for exactly.
g

Anna_012_fYIt's VERY random! Especially since he was making me laugh without even telling any jokes!
E

Anna_013_f7Well, he was making me laugh without telling any jokes.
M

Anna_007_f?I'm not sure I have room for any more food-related emergencies.
2

Anna_008_f$Don't worry; it's nothing like that.
v

Anna_004_fhOr perhaps a different food-related issue? Do you have an abundance of sandwiches I could help you with?
$

Anna_005_fNo, nothing like that!
