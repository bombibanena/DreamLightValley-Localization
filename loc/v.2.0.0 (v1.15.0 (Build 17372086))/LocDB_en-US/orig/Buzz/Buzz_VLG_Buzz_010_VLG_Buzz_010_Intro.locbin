Buzz_000_f‘{PlayerName}, I've done a thorough surveillance of the Valley, but I've yet to find the best way to make myself useful here. Could you assist me?
,
Player_000_choice_003_fI'd love to help.
<
Player_000_choice_004_f!Let's shelve this idea for a bit.
T

Buzz_028_fFGreat! I... uh... well, I'm just not used to feeling unsure of myself.
u

Buzz_004_fgI've become quite skilled at being a toy, but here... I don't have to freeze whenever a human walks by.
\

Buzz_003_fNEveryone I speak to is so... tall. Add to that, some of you have magic powers!
a

Buzz_005_fSI may have karate chop action and high-pressure space wings, but I don't have that.

Player_001_choice_000_fYou're a hero in your own way.
B
Player_001_choice_001_f'Okay, what do you think Woody would do?
E
Player_001_choice_002_f*You're my friend, so never doubt yourself.
ˆ

Buzz_007_fzI'm glad you think so. I may be a foot tall and made of plastic, but part of me will always feel like a real Space Ranger.
i

Buzz_009_f[That's it, Buzz! That's what you can do around here. You can set up a Star Command outpost.
š

Buzz_011_f‹You mean like a local law enforcement unit? Hmm... That just might work! I could go on missions, uncover mysteries, patrol the perimeter...
E

Buzz_013_f7And my first act will be to recruit you into the ranks.

Buzz_012_fWelcome aboard, cadet!
q

Buzz_006_fcWe'll use the RV as Star Command headquarters. But we'll also need to build a transportation fleet.
c
Player_006_fSI'll make a <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Ship</ActivityItem> to put in front of it...
<
Player_006_choice_000_f!This is going to be a lot of fun.
M
Player_006_choice_001_f2That shouldn't be too complicated to build, right?
I
Player_006_choice_002_f.We can't be Space Rangers without a spaceship.
 

Buzz_030_fThat's the spirit!


Buzz_014_fA <ActivityItem>Space Ranger Ship</ActivityItem> shouldn't be too difficult to construct for someone with your talents. You'll need <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Iron Ingots</ActivityItem>.
'

Buzz_031_fNot at all, {PlayerName}.
'

Buzz_032_fRoger that, {PlayerName}.
Š

Buzz_027_f|Well, I suppose he'd listen to his inner voice. But my inner voice mainly talks about saving the galaxy and fighting Zurg...
m

Buzz_008_f_Thanks, friend. You know, when I thought I was a real Space Ranger, I would never doubt myself.


Buzz_010_fShelve?
$

Buzz_001_fOh. Like a toy. Ha-ha.
Q

Buzz_002_fCClever wordplay, {PlayerName}. I'll be here when you have the time.
