Timon_000_fHWhoa, whoa, whoa! Who are you? And why do you smell like my buddy SIMBA?
!
Player_000_fI'm {PlayerName}!
5
Player_000_choice_000_fSimba sent me to find you!
5
Player_000_choice_001_fAnd Simba's my friend too!
/
Player_000_choice_002_f... Maybe I ate him.

Timon_001_fHe did?
2
Timon_002_f#Why didn't he come find us himself?
<
Player_001_f,It's a little complicated. Let's just say...
N
Player_001_choice_000_f3You have to trust me! He wants you to come with me.
I
Player_001_choice_001_f.He's somewhere GREAT and I can take you there.
=
Player_001_choice_002_f"You'll find out in time. Let's go.
e
Timon_003_fVHold on! We aren't goin' anywhere until we know it's someplace we'd actually wanna be.
õ
Timon_004_fãSo even if you're Simba's new friend ‚Äî and that's a pretty big "IF" ‚Äî I don't know WHERE you came from, or what kinda animal you are...
<
Timon_005_f-... Say... What kinda animal are you, anyway?
#
Player_002_choice_000_fA human.
6
Player_002_choice_001_fI'm a special kind of lion.
:
Player_002_choice_002_fA more relaxed animal than you.
!
Timon_006_fNever heard of it.
Ò
Timon_007_f·Whatever you are, you're too stressed for me and Pumbaa. Before we can consider goin' with you, you've gotta take some hakuna matata lessons from us. And since you're a "friend" of Simba's you'll know all about hakuna matata.
+
Player_003_choice_000_fSounds like fun!
+
Player_003_choice_001_fIf you insist...
.
Timon_008_fOkay, then let's get started...
¶
Timon_009_fñWe gotta get to the root of this worry you're givin' off. Are you stressed because you don't have enough fur? A nice sleek coat? Or a big fluffy mane?
6
Player_004_f&Maybe... What if I make myself a mane?
A
Player_004_choice_000_f&That'll get me into the jungle groove.
4
Player_004_choice_001_fI love creative projects!
2
Player_004_choice_002_fI've always wanted one!
2
Timon_010_f#Perfect! That'll be our first step.
x
Timon_011_fiOkay, well... First, I'll need to <Lore>gather materials to build a Crafting Station to work at</Lore>...
|
Timon_012_fmTell ya what, you <Lore>bring the stuff to me</Lore> and Pumbaa and I will help build your... whatever it is.
e
Timon_013_fVSure, yeah. If gettin' creative helps you find your "no worries" mindset, let's do it.
Q
Timon_014_fBWell, what are ya waiting for? Let's make the mane of your dreams!
G
Timon_015_f8Oh, come on! Lighten up! This is not a great start, pal.
}
Timon_016_fnA lion? I've never seen a lion that looks like YOU before but... Then again, I do my best to avoid most lions.
ç
Timon_017_f~Hey! An animal I've never seen before just walks in here and says I gotta follow them to find my friend? That is NOT relaxing!
G
Timon_018_f8But we're not talkin' about me, we're talkin' about YOU.
R
Timon_019_fCUh-huh. Sure he is. If he's your buddy, why isn't he here with you?
 
Timon_020_fYOU ate HIM?! HA!
e
Timon_021_fVYour teeth aren't even sharp! Don't try to kid me, kid. What're you REALLY doin' here?
