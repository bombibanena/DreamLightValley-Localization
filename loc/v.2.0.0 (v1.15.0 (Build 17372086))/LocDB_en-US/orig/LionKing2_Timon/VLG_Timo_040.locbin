<Village!LionKing!Timon!VLG_Timo_040_Group10_StoryDescriptionßThe Forgotten suggests you need a tonic to amplify Dreamlight Magic and supplies you with a tonic recipe of their own invention. They also add that the Mites may have seen you coming, and say you may want to dress in purple with bug wings to throw them off.
