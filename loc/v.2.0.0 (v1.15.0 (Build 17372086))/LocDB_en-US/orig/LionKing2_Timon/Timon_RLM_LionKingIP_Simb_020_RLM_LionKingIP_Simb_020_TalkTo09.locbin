Timon_000_f[Okay, {PlayerName}, to start your hakuna matata lessons, you gotta put your past behind ya!
?
Timon_001_f0And *I* came up with the perfect way to do that.
~
Timon_002_foKind of a symbolic gesture, if you will... It's time for you to get rid of something that represents your past!
L

Þ
Timon_013_fÎI could make a bottle or an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem>... but I need <ActivityItem>Sand</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Coal</ActivityItem> to make glass. Coal is a black rock that makes fire.
ý
Timon_014_fíYou're in luck, 'cause there's <Lore>some sand in the jungle</Lore>. And if this dusty rock is the "coal" you mentioned, it's all yours. Pumbaa and I tried to use it to grind up some bugs, but it turned our delicious bug mash all gritty.
