TheForgotten_000_f1After all this time... here we are. Face to face.
q
TheForgotten_013_f[I have all these... these memories in my head all of a sudden. You must have seen them too.

TheForgotten_014_f"So you must know what I am by now.

Player_002_choice_000_f"You're my inner child, aren't you?
;
Player_002_choice_002_f You're everything I left behind.
<
Player_002_choice_003_f!You're some sort of shadow of me.
V
TheForgotten_015_f@You split off from me when I stopped visiting Dreamlight Valley.
i
TheForgotten_016_fSInner child...? But how can we really say which one of us is the real {PlayerName}?
Z
TheForgotten_017_fDMaybe you're just the part that moved on. A piece of ME that left...
B
Player_000_choice_000_f'It doesn't matter. I just want to help.
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$No sudden moves... I'm watching you.
<
Player_000_choice_002_f!That's enough. Get out of my way.
G
TheForgotten_001_f1I don't want to hurt you. Really. I want to help.
n
TheForgotten_005_fXIs that what you think about me? That I'm... I'm some kind of weakling who needs "help"?
9
TheForgotten_006_f#Maybe I was. Once. But not anymore.
>
Player_001_choice_000_f#Needing help doesn't make you weak.
Q
Player_001_choice_001_f6You put on a big show... but I can tell you're scared.
|
TheForgotten_012_ffThat's what Merlin was trying to tell you. Caring for others... That's not something you leave behind.
*
TheForgotten_032_fBusy? Doing what...?
ˆ
TheForgotten_035_frDo you expect me to just tell you my whole plan?! Like some kind of... some kind of villain at the end of a movie?
>
Player_003_choice_000_f#If you've got a plan... I can help.
I
Player_003_choice_002_f.I mean... you're kind of giving off that vibe?
U
TheForgotten_022_f?It makes us stronger. Not weaker. It holds the Valley together.
.
TheForgotten_024_fPlease. Let us help you.
o
TheForgotten_028_fYYou think I didn't TRY to ask for help? After that day with Scar... no one could hear me.
{
TheForgotten_029_feI was trapped in the shadows. Alone. Lost. It takes all my magic now just to step out into the light.
A
TheForgotten_030_f+But you're here now. Let's fix all of this.
R
TheForgotten_025_f<Fix all of this? That's exactly what I've been trying to do.
,
TheForgotten_031_fI haven't been hiding.
%
TheForgotten_026_fI've been busy.
O
TheForgotten_036_f9You could never help. Because you could never understand.
†
TheForgotten_027_fpThere's only one way to make sure that no one ever gets pulled to the dark side of Dreamlight Valley like I was.
L
TheForgotten_038_f6Only one way to make sure no one is ever lonely again.
p
TheForgotten_033_fZI need to rip open the walls between worlds. Between Dreamlight Valley and the other side.
‚
TheForgotten_040_flAnd now I have the last thing I was missing. The way to fuel the spell. <Lore>The Orb of Remembrance</Lore>!
K
TheForgotten_037_f5You still don't get it. I'm not the bad guy. YOU are.
¹
TheForgotten_023_f¢If you really felt like you were so strong, then you wouldn't have stayed in the shadows all this time. Whatever was happening to you... Merlin could have helped.
u
TheForgotten_002_f_I want to talk, but... you better not try to rip open a portal or hex me or anything like that!
D
TheForgotten_007_f.Heh. You're afraid of me? Good. You should be.
‚
TheForgotten_008_flMaybe Merlin should have been afraid of me too. Instead of thinking I was some weakling who needed his help.
k
TheForgotten_003_fUAfter everything you've done to this Village... we've got nothing more to talk about.
E
TheForgotten_004_f/Step aside so I can fix the damage you've done.
-
TheForgotten_009_fFix the damage...? Heh.

TheForgotten_010_fiDon't you see that running around and helping everybody... it makes them weak. And it makes YOU weak too.
~
TheForgotten_018_fhWhen I stopped visiting Dreamlight Valley... when I let go of my childlike wonder... You're all of that.
s
TheForgotten_019_f]What you left behind...? But how can you really say which one of us is the real {PlayerName}?
`
TheForgotten_020_fJWhen I left Dreamlight Valley... I left a shadow, an echo. And that's you.
b
TheForgotten_021_fLME? How do you know I'm not the REAL {PlayerName}? What if YOU'RE the echo?!
