Kristoff_000_fI had a good talk with Flynn.
,
Kristoff_001_fAnd did he open up to you?
±
Kristoff_005_fûYeah. And you're right. The poor guy's hung up on a girl. But he wants to solve everything to do with Maleficent's curse before he goes looking for her again.

Player_000_choice_000_fOh! Poor Flynn!

Player_000_choice_001_fThis is all Maleficent's fault!

Kristoff_009_f6Heartbreak isn't easy. Trust me; I'm familiar with it.

Kristoff_014_fSYou can't feel good when you think you hurt someone you love, even unintentionally.

Kristoff_015_fFlynn just needs to know that if he needs help getting to the bottom of what happened with Maleficent... I'll be there for him.

Kristoff_016_f<You should tell him that. I think he'd really appreciate it.

Kristoff_017_fThanks for your help, Kristoff.

Kristoff_018_fYThe more I get to know Anna, the harder it is to see her upset that I don't remember her.
S
Kristoff_019_fAI don't feel good knowing she's hurting, no matter what happened.
V
Kristoff_007_fDThat curse sure did a number on him. But it's even deeper than that.

Kristoff_010_f#He's lonely. I can understand that.

Kristoff_008_fSFeelings are complicated and confusing... not always clean-cut like a block of ice.

Kristoff_011_f;And heartbreak is not an easy thing to get through. I know.
