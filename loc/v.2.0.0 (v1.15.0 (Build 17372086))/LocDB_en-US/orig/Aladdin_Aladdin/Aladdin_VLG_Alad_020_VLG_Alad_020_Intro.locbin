Aladdin_000_fÉHey {PlayerName}, I've been thinking... How'd you like to get around the Valley with your own <Lore>Dreamlight Magic Carpet</Lore>?
F
Player_000_choice_000_f+My own flying carpet? Let's make it happen!
'
Player_000_choice_001_fMaybe later!

Aladdin_004_f$Ha-ha! I thought you might say that!
ù
Aladdin_005_fãAfter chasing all those enchanted coins from Mr. McDuck's vault around the Valley, I bet you could really use a carpet to get around quick.
E
Player_001_choice_000_f*It would be nice to glide around in style!
;
Player_001_choice_001_f I'm kind of afraid of heights...
O
Player_001_choice_002_f4Well, most days I'm way over my step count, so sure!
,
Aladdin_013_fThat's what I was thinking!
m

A
Player_002_choice_002_f&Not sure I'm good at carpet weaving...
t
Aladdin_007_fcWell, I guess there's really only one place to start: We gotta figure out how to make a carpet fly.
q
Aladdin_010_f`Would you <Lore>talk to Merlin</Lore> and ask him if he knows anything about enchanting carpets?
N
Aladdin_016_f=While you do that, I'm gonna ask around about carpet weaving.
%
Aladdin_008_fHey, you deserve it!
&
Aladdin_017_fFirst things first...
;
Aladdin_009_f*That's okay. We won't be doing this alone.
