Merida_001_fGSo you see this place, {PlayerName}? It's called <Lore>the Bind</Lore>!
T
Merida_002_fDI think the name's because it sort of binds the whole Vale together.
ë
Merida_004_fÄAnd it's got stories sewn right into it. From the walls of the cliffs to the leaves of the trees to the paths beneath your feet.

Player_000_choice_003_f(It's kind of a mess right now, isn't it?
>
Merida_003_f.Aye, it reminds me of my home at harvest time.
Q
Merida_007_fAIf you think it's a beauty now, you ought to have seen it before.
k
Merida_006_f[The poor place has seen far better days. When the Neverafter struck, it all went to pieces.

Player_001_choice_000_f=Don't worry. I'm getting pretty good at fixing broken things.
`
Player_001_choice_001_fESo if we stop Maleficent and Hades' feud... maybe it will fix itself?
â
Merida_008_fyThe Lorekeeper told me that about you, {PlayerName}. And I'm beginnin' to believe you might even be able to fix all this!
W
Merida_024_fGThe Bind needs a heap of work before it'll be back to its former glory.
Å
Merida_027_fqWhy don't you try <Lore>clearing up some of these Inkies and catching some of those Snippets</Lore> flyin' about?
å
Merida_026_f|And I'll work on the <Lore>fountains</Lore>. They're all dried up and broken. But don't worry. I'll get them bubbling again.
ò
Merida_009_fáNo, you've got it all backwards. If we're going to get to those two hot heads in the first place, we need to clean this place up first.
V
Merida_005_fFThat's for sure. Though, most of these don't talk like the Lorekeeper.
