Merida_001_f#Whoo-hoo! You caught some Snippets!
`
Merida_002_fPSo the Royal Net was hidden right there all along, under that face in the floor.
I
Merida_003_f9Wait... That's a picture of <Lore>Princess Aurora</Lore>!

Player_000_choice_002_fNo time to waste! What's next?
E
Merida_004_f5Oh, she was a really kind lass who used to live here.
G
Merida_005_f7Not too long ago <Lore>she just up and vanished</Lore>.

Merida_006_fZMaybe the Lorekeeper can help us find where Aurora went. But we'll have to help her first.

Merida_015_f&There's no time to waste! What's next?
¤
Merida_010_f“Well, catching just a few of those paper pests isn't nearly enough. We'll have to catch more <ActivityItem>Snippets</ActivityItem> with that Net...
E
Merida_011_f5...and put all that magic back inside the Lorekeeper.
‰
Merida_012_fyI noticed some of them are <Lore>stuck in the wings of the Library</Lore>. Only those parts of the Library are locked up.
Á
Merida_013_f°You might be able to open them using those big wheels by the doors. They won't budge for me, but it looks like <Lore>they're made out of the same stuff as the Royal Net</Lore>.
¹
Merida_014_f¨Try swinging your Net at the wheels! If it were me, I'd <Lore>swing it from above</Lore> to catch what's up high or hold it tight and <Lore>wind up to do a spin</Lore>.

Merida_007_f8The Lorekeeper told me that some kindly fairies made it.
x
Merida_008_fhIt's the only thing that can catch the Snippets. They put a spell on it so only two people could use it.
