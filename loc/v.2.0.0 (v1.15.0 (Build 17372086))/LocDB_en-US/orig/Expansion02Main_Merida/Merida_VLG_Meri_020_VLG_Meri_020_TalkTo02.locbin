Merida_003_fIMerida... Flynn tells me that you stuck some posters up around his House.
.
Merida_004_fDo these look familiar to you?
=
Merida_005_f-Hmm? Oh, definitely. That's Flynn, all right.
?
Merida_006_f/They really captured his nose, don't you think?
A
Player_000_choice_000_f&I've gotta admit, that's pretty funny.

Player_000_choice_002_fThat's not nice, Merida.
*
Merida_007_fHee-hee. That'll show him.
j
Merida_017_fZWhat sort of person leaves a collection of his own wanted posters just lying about anyway?
L
Merida_000_f<I bet he takes them out and just looks at himself every day.
4
Merida_010_f$Well, has he learned his lesson yet?
&
Player_001_choice_000_fDefinitely.
&
Player_001_choice_001_fI think so.
6
Player_001_choice_002_fNo. But he's getting there.
P
Merida_011_f@Good. Then, as long as he leaves me alone, I'll leave him alone.
^
Merida_012_fNIt would be best if we could all get along. You and Flynn aren't so different.
^
Merida_013_fNI'll bet you would be really good friends if you just got to know one another.
X
Merida_015_fHWe don't ALL have to be friends around here. But if you REALLY insist...
g
Merida_014_fWBack home, the clans would get together and talk out their disputes over a grand feast.
‡
Merida_016_fwGreat idea! I'll whip something up for you! You invite Flynn and I'll bring a meal from right here in the Bind for you.
Q
Merida_009_fAHmph. He ought to be happy I didn't use them for target practice.
