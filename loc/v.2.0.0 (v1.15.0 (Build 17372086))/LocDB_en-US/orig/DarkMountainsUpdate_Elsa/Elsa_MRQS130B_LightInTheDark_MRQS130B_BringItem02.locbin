Elsa_009_f[It's funny. Just a second ago, it was like my memories of this were covered over by a mist.

Elsa_010_fjBut then... I looked at you, and I thought of our friendship, and the adventures we've gone on together...

Elsa_011_f'And I remembered... I gave this to you.

Elsa_012_fIYou were just a child then. You wanted to explore the Ice Cavern with me.

Elsa_013_fLBut it was so cold in there. So I brought you my favorite blanket from home.

Elsa_014_fÄAnd when the Forgotten split off... well, I guess they held onto it until they dropped it in the secret chamber. I wish I could remember this. But I guess the Forgotten has some of those memories.

Elsa_015_fUWell, I hope you can help pull the Forgotten back from the edge before it's too late.

Elsa_016_fqAnd if you do manage to bring them back... well, maybe I can talk with them. I know what it's like to go too far.

Elsa_017_ffThanks, Elsa. That's all I need for now. The magic coming off of the blanket seems stronger already...
