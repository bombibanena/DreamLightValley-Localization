Belle_000_f/You found the secret passage? That's wonderful!
?
Player_000_choice_000_f$Behind a bookshelf! Dream come true!
3
Player_000_choice_001_fIt took forever to find.
:
Player_000_choice_002_fBet it's really dusty in there.
K
Belle_004_f<It is intriguing, isn't it? Like something out of a mystery.

Belle_005_fLet's go see the Beast!
F
Belle_006_f7I think I ought to stay here. He's still upset with me.

Belle_007_fmOh, but you are a stranger... He won't like a stranger in his room either. Even the staff rarely go in there.
:
Player_002_choice_000_fI could dress like one of them?
7
Player_002_choice_001_fI'm not scared of the Beast.
6
Player_002_choice_002_fI'll dress up as Cogsworth!
@
Belle_014_f1That way, he might just think I'm a staff member.
E
Belle_008_f6It is rather dark in there... I suppose it might work.

Belle_015_fI used to sew quite often when my father needed things for his inventions. With a few special items, I'm sure I could make a costume for you.

Belle_016_f«Let's see... We'll need <ActivityItem>Castle Candles</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Castle Candle Holders</ActivityItem>, and a <ActivityItem>Golden Curtain</ActivityItem>.
e
Belle_017_fVIf you <Lore>search the castle</Lore>, I know you'll find what we need for a disguise.
\
Belle_001_fMI admire your courage, but I'd feel better if you wore some sort of disguise.
u
Belle_018_ffYou know Cogsworth, too? I'm not sure he'd appreciate being imitated... but that does give me an idea.
Z
Belle_002_fKI guess whoever built it really wanted to keep the secret passage a secret.
i
Belle_003_fZI'm sure you're right. I doubt anyone has used that passage in years. You'll be the first!
