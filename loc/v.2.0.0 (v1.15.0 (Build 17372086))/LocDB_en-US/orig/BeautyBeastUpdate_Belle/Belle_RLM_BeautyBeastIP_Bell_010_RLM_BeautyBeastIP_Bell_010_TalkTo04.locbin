Belle_000_f#You saw the Beast? Is he all right?
,
Player_000_choice_000_fI think he's sad.
5
Player_000_choice_001_fHe's still upset with you.
1
Player_000_choice_002_fHe's having a tantrum.
g
Belle_003_fXHe thinks he'll never measure up to the prince in that old portrait you were staring at.

Belle_005_fOh no...
˜
Belle_006_fˆI was just trying to see if there was something there that would help me understand who he was so I can better understand who he is now.
5
Player_002_choice_000_fHe didn't see it that way.
3
Player_002_choice_001_fIt was a simple mistake!
4
Player_002_choice_002_fGood idea, bad execution.
I
Belle_011_f:I'm so sorry about that... *sigh* I'm not sure what to do.
6
Belle_013_f'... What if we made him a new painting?
F
Belle_014_f7What an interesting idea, but... I don't paint. Do you?
(
Player_003_choice_000_fIn my dreams!
-
Player_003_choice_001_fNot even a little.
5
Player_003_choice_002_fFinger painting is my jam.
:
Belle_017_f+Well, I'm sure you have many other talents.
I
Belle_020_f:If only we could snap our fingers and have a new painting.
ˆ
Belle_021_fyHey, great idea! Maybe I can use some of my Dreamlight Magic to help us. I'll head to the Valley and consult with Merlin.
!
Belle_022_fWhat's a "Merlin"?
/
Player_004_choice_000_fOur resident wizard.
-
Player_004_choice_001_fMy magical mentor!
?
Player_004_choice_002_f$Probably "very tired" at this point.
;
Belle_029_f,You mean a real wizard? Like in a storybook?

Belle_008_fExactly!
A
Belle_023_f2He's like a magical encyclopedia with a great hat.
f
Belle_007_fWMerlin's always trying to help people in the Valley with his magic and his experiments!
w
Belle_024_fhExperiments? Hmm... Merlin sounds a bit like my father and his inventions. I'd love to meet him someday.
+
Belle_009_fHey, maybe someday you will!
d
Belle_027_fUFor now, I'll <Lore>go talk to Merlin about some magic to make a new painting</Lore>.
Z
Belle_030_fKThat would be wonderful! I look forward to hearing about what you discover.
8
Belle_028_f)People ask him LOTS of questions all day.
G
Belle_016_f8Hmm. Is there someone we could commission to create one?
6
Belle_018_f'Your "jam"? Does that mean you like it?
y
Belle_019_fjKinda? I do like jam. And finger painting... But probably not enough to make a new painting for the Beast.
F
Belle_010_f7A mistake I need to fix. But I'm not sure what to do...
d
Belle_012_fUYou're right... I should have respected his wishes. I have to find a way to fix this!
\
Belle_002_fMYou meant well... but it bothered him that you were staring at that portrait.
k
Belle_004_f\He's just upset that you were staring at that old portrait in his room. I'm sure it'll pass.
