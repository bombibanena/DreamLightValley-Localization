Merlin_000_fWHow marvelous! A <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> with an M engraved in it!

Merlin_001_fuNow, this may not look like much, {PlayerName}, but it's proof your efforts against the Forgetting are bearing fruit.

Player_000_choice_001_fWho does it belong to?
[
Player_000_choice_002_f@I thought the local expert on weirdness might know what it is...
ù
Merlin_002_fåOh, no, no. Not to worry, {PlayerName}. This <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> belongs to a charming lass named Mirabel Madrigal.

Merlin_003_flYou wanted her to feel at home. So, with my help, you enchanted her House to remind her of where she's from.

Player_001_choice_000_f"I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

Player_001_choice_001_f!How do you prove that to a House?
F
Player_001_choice_002_f+So even the buildings are judging me now...
t
Merlin_004_fdThe enchantment gave the building the power to reflect Mirabel's kindness and energy. But even so...
m
Merlin_005_f]We never expected Mini-Casita to become quite so magical and so protective of its inhabitant.
!
Merlin_006_fWhat do you mean?
ô
Merlin_007_fàWhen the Forgetting struck, Mirabel, like many of us, started to lose her memories. Then, one morning, her House wasn't there anymore...
S
Merlin_008_fCI quickly went to investigate, and what I discovered astonished me.
Z
Merlin_009_fJTo protect Mirabel, her home disappeared into a small universe of its own.
ä
Merlin_010_fzFinding this <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> can only mean one thing. Mini-Casita is considering coming back.
Y
Merlin_011_fIBut first, you'll need to prove to it that the Valley is safe once again.

Merlin_012_f
Marvelous!
A
Merlin_035_f1After all, everyone appreciates being thought of.
Ø
Merlin_022_fûThe more acts of kindness you perform, the more magic the <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> will gain. Once it has enough, Mini-Casita will return.
K
Merlin_023_f;I'll give this a trial run. I'll talk to you once I'm done.
m
Merlin_013_f]Now, houses believe in deeds, not words. And houses often come to resemble their inhabitants.
d
Merlin_014_fTTo prove the Valley's safe for Mirabel, you'll have to embody the Madrigals' values.
/
Merlin_015_fWhat are the Madrigals' values?
l
Merlin_016_f\Well, I'm told they always believe in bringing their village together to help the community.
¨
Merlin_017_fõAnd I remember Mirabel checking in on everyone here to ensure their needs were fulfilled. Oh, and she also became quite fond of photographs, if that helps.
@
Merlin_018_f0Hmmm... I could take some pictures of Villagers.
Ñ
Merlin_019_ftAs for making sure everyone's needs are fulfilled... I could check what the Villagers need and give them some gifts.
|
Merlin_020_flFine ideas indeed, {PlayerName}. Why, simply engaging some of the Villagers in conversation might be enough.
=
Merlin_024_f-Not to worry. You'll find it's rather simple.
O
Merlin_025_f?Oh. Heh-heh-heh, uh, well. Most magical things have opinions...

Merlin_029_f"Sounds like there's a story there.
_
Merlin_030_fOSome other time, perhaps. We must focus on bringing Mirabel back to the Valley.
á
Merlin_031_fwThe Old Ruler wanted her to feel at home. So, with my help, they enchanted her House to remind her of where she's from.
R
Merlin_032_fBWhy, this belongs to a charming young lass named Mirabel Madrigal.
â
Merlin_033_fyHeh. "Expert on weirdness." That's not a title I've ever heard before, but it does have a sort of ring to it, doesn't it?
Ñ
Merlin_034_ftNow then, this <ActivityItem>Golden Doorknob</ActivityItem> belongs to a charming young lass named Mirabel Madrigal.
