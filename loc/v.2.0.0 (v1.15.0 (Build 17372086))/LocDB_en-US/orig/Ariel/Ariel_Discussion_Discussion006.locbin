Player_000_choice_002_fIt's hard to choose just one!

Ariel_001_fqBefore I saw it, I was so curious about it. I know it can be helpful and also hurtful. What do you like about it?
.
Player_000_choice_003_fIt's warm and cozy.

Player_000_choice_004_fIt's bright and beautiful.
'
Player_000_choice_005_fIt's useful.

Ariel_004_fMmm. That does sound nice.

Ariel_007_f@If I'm on land when it gets cold, I like being near a warm fire.
(
Ariel_005_fIt is! And it's warm too.
b
Ariel_006_fSYes! It provides light and heat, and I know humans like to cook their food over it.
Z
Ariel_002_fKOh. When I wore them, they pinched a little. Why do you like shoes so much?

Player_000_choice_006_fThey protect my feet.

Ariel_008_f‡Oh, I guess that makes sense. The water doesn't hurt my feet, but I suppose there are things on land that would if I didn't wear shoes.
:
Ariel_009_f+Really?! I didn't know shoes could do that.
F
Ariel_010_f7Let me see... Oh, you're right. Your shoes are so neat!
j
Ariel_003_f[I would have trouble choosing, too. But please do try. At least tell me one you like a lot.
