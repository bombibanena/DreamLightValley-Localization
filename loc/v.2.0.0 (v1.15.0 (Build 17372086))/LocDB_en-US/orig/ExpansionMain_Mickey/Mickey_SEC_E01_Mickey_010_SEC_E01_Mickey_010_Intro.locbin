Mickey_002_f†Welp, I've seen all kinds of incredible flowers around Eternity Isle, and I wanna give Minnie some that are just as special as she is.

Mickey_004_fpBut a few of 'em are kinda hard to get to without magic. Like those <Lore>shiny blue ones</Lore> in the Dunes...

Mickey_009_f<Or the <Lore>nice orange ones</Lore> in Ancient's Landing...
o
Mickey_005_f_Oh, and I also saw some <Lore>big green ones</Lore> that were movin' around in the Wild Tangle!
q
Mickey_006_faYeah, those seem kind of... dangerous. Don't worry. I know just the flowers you're talking about.
q
Mickey_007_faI'll see if I can find those for you. In the meantime... be careful if you go exploring the Isle!

Mickey_008_fDon't worry! I will!
