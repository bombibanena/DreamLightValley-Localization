Elsa_000_f~{PlayerName}! Thank goodness you're here! I've been doing everything I can to try to stop the blizzard in the Frosted Heights.
c

Elsa_001_fUBut nothing I do seems to work. It has some sort of dark Dreamlight Magic feeding it.
W

Elsa_002_fII think I might have found the key to fixing it. But I do need your help.
A

Elsa_003_f3Of course. Anything. Just tell me what I should do.
r

Elsa_004_fdI went to the center of the blizzard and found a secret chamber full of strange magical experiments.
6

Elsa_005_f(And that's not all. I found Olaf inside!
z

Elsa_006_flOlaf! Oh, what a relief! Anna and I have been so worried about him. Did he know anything about the blizzard?
0
Player_000_choice_000_fYes! He's helping me.
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/He knew a little. But we need to find out more.
P
Player_000_choice_002_f5Not really. He got me to chase some squirrels around.
)

Elsa_007_fGood. What did he tell you?
˜

Elsa_008_f‰Olaf's arms are missing. He says the last thing he remembers is that they were holding on to the Orb. We need that to restore the Pillar.
e

Elsa_009_fWBut he doesn't know where to find them. He said something about... water having memory?
–

Elsa_010_f‡That's it! Olaf can be a bit of a genius. But I'm not sure my powers will help. Whatever happened may not be tied closely enough to me.
Š

Elsa_011_f|But you might be able to do it. In the past, your Royal Watering Can could <Lore>draw out the memories held by water.</Lore>
§

Elsa_012_f˜Hm. Then maybe we could find out exactly what happened to the Orb. Do you think my Watering Can still has that power...? I wouldn't know where to start.
Ð

Elsa_013_fÁMy friend Grand Pabbie would say to start where things began. And that would be <Lore>the Pillar in the Frosted Heights.</Lore> I'll keep trying to fend off this blizzard while you investigate.
`

Elsa_014_fRJust hold out your Watering Can and <Lore>focus your magic</Lore> near the Pillar.


Elsa_015_fWhat did he say?
>

Elsa_016_f0That does sound like Olaf. What did he tell you?
