Elsa_028_fWell... have you ever...
.

Elsa_001_f I guess I'm just wondering if...
"

Elsa_017_fHmm... This is hard.
 

Elsa_018_fI'll start over...
\

Elsa_029_fNSince I've arrived here, I've tried to find my place, to fit in with everyone.
E

Elsa_030_f7But I feel a little lost. Have you ever felt like that?

Player_000_choice_013_fHave you always felt like that?

Elsa_037_f%This is rather strange, {PlayerName}.
z

Elsa_038_flWhen I started reading through these recipe books, they brought back a memory of my past here in the Valley.
.

Elsa_027_f I was cooking with my friends...
W

Elsa_039_fIAnd it felt like something we'd done before. I just couldn't remember it.
Œ

Elsa_040_f~We were making <ActivityItem>Arendellian Fish Pie</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Arendellian Pickled Herring</ActivityItem>.
S

Elsa_041_fEIt was so nice. Maybe we could make one of the dishes together again.
 
Player_003_fLet's make both!
(
Player_003_choice_000_fIt'll be fun.
@
Player_003_choice_001_f%I'm super curious about your cuisine.

Player_003_choice_002_f"You'll feel at home twice as fast.
Q

Elsa_016_fCBut it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who feels this way.
±

Elsa_020_f¢Hey, I just thought of something that Remy told me the other day. He was talking about how our senses of smell and taste are the most connected to our memories...
}

Elsa_026_foIf you want to feel more at home... why don't we try cooking something that reminds you of where you come from?
T

Elsa_033_fFCooking...? How interesting. But I haven't done much cooking before...
3

Elsa_034_f%Well, that's another thing Remy says.
 

Elsa_035_f"Anyone can cook."
’

Elsa_032_fƒYou know, it's funny â€” I did see a couple of traditional Arendellian <ActivityItem>Recipe Books</ActivityItem> in the Ice Cavern.
!

Elsa_036_fI'll go get them...
4

Elsa_021_f&Oh, thank you! I really appreciate it.
Ò

Elsa_000_fÃAccording to the <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem>, what makes the <ActivityItem>Arendellian Fish Pie</ActivityItem> so special is that you use <ActivityItem>Dandelion Syrup</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Herring</ActivityItem>, plus some <ActivityItem>Wheat</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Butter</ActivityItem>.
è

Elsa_024_fÙThe <ActivityItem>Dandelion Syrup</ActivityItem> is made from <ActivityItem>Garlic</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Lemons</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Dandelions</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Onions</ActivityItem>.
~

Elsa_019_fpIf you bring me these Ingredients, maybe we can prepare the syrup together. The instructions are all right here.
˜

Elsa_025_f‰Oh, and the <ActivityItem>Arendellian Pickled Herring</ActivityItem> is fairly easy. Here's the <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem>.

Elsa_022_f%Oh, thank you. I hope you'll like it.

Elsa_023_f/That sounds wonderful. Thank you, {PlayerName}.
›

Elsa_014_fŒWell, I used to when I was hiding my powers and so isolated. But these last few years, thanks to Anna's help, I've felt a lot more at peace.
 

Elsa_015_fYou're very lucky.
N

Elsa_002_f@Oh, I understand. I'd love to catch up, when you have some time.
