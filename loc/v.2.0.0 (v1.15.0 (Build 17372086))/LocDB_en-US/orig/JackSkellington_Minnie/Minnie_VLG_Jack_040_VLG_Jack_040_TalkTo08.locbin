Minnie_006_fGMinnie ‚Äî are you okay? Did Jack Skellington give you a horrible gift?
@
Minnie_007_f0Oh, no. Jack had the most wonderful gift for me!

Minnie_008_f
He... did?
à
Minnie_009_fxYes. I came back to my House to find a mysterious letter saying "Happy Dreamlight Day"... and then everything went dark!
å
Minnie_010_f|When I reached around to find the light switch, I put my hands into something that could only have been cold and slimy guts!

Minnie_011_fNo!

Minnie_012_fYes!
i
Minnie_013_fYI kept looking, but the next thing I knew, my hands were full of what felt like eyeballs!

Player_000_choice_000_fThis sounds horrifying?!
?
Player_000_choice_001_f$That Jack has questions to answer...
6
Player_000_choice_002_fHmmm, that sounds familiar.
.
Minnie_014_fIt was! I absolutely loved it!
}
Minnie_027_fmYeah. Maybe if we can convince him that Oogie Boogie has come to the Valley, too... that might frighten Jack?
Œ
Minnie_028_fΩLet's try it! I've already made some <ActivityItem>Oogie Boogie Fan Club Signs</ActivityItem> and an <ActivityItem>Oogie Boogie Shirt</ActivityItem>! Maybe you could use them to trick Jack.
\
Minnie_001_fLIf you put a sign in <Lore>each Biome</Lore>, then Jack is sure to see them!
*
Player_001_choice_000_fThanks, Minnie!
F
Player_001_choice_001_f+Please don't try to scare me in the future!
É
Minnie_018_fsWhen the lights came back on, there was a plate of cold spaghetti and a bowl of peeled grapes right in front of me!
J
Minnie_019_f:Oh, so Jack gifted you a classic haunted house experience?
/
Minnie_020_fHe did. And it was so much fun!
ñ
Minnie_021_fÖI wonder, though... Jack spends so much time thinking of ways to scare other people, but when has anyone taken the time to scare him?
`
Minnie_022_fPThat's a great question, Minnie. How about we take the initiative and go for it?
D
Minnie_023_f4That's just what I was thinking, and I have an idea.
O
Minnie_024_f?You do? What could scare someone like the Pumpkin King himself?
k
Minnie_025_f[Well, he mentioned that he used to have a nemesis. What if we use the idea of Oogie Boogie?
$
Minnie_029_fYou're very welcome.
ç
Minnie_000_f}Oh, and if you really want to give him a fright, try using the Touch of Magic tool with this <Lore>Oogie Boogie Motif</Lore>!
I
Minnie_030_f9I'll only do it if you ask to be scared first. I promise.
1
Minnie_015_f!Oh, please don't be angry at him!
=
Minnie_016_f-Did the guts and eyeballs... smell like food?

Minnie_017_f	They did!
