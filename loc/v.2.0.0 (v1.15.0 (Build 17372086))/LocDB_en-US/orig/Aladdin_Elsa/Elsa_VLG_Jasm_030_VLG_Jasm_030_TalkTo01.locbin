Elsa_000_fŽHi, Elsa! Jasmine and I are on a mission to find a missing key to open an old journal of mine. We think it's somewhere in the Frosted Heights.
—

Elsa_001_fˆWell, {PlayerName}, I was just about to come find you. Some odd, unbreakable ice surrounding a chest suddenly appeared in my Ice Cavern.
Q
Player_000_choice_000_f6That's too much of a coincidence to not mean anything.
M
Player_000_choice_001_f2Hmm... I wonder if that has to do with my journal?
,
Player_000_choice_002_fThat's... random.

Elsa_003_f>You think the unbreakable ice is connected to the missing key?
±

Elsa_002_f¢Well... the first key for the journal was difficult to retrieve. I think I wanted to keep whatever is in my <ActivityItem>Secret Journal</ActivityItem> very safe.
l

Elsa_011_f^Before the Forgetting, someone must have asked for your help to keep this other key safe, too.
J

Elsa_008_f<And you think the missing key is in the chest. I understand.
z

Elsa_009_flExactly! <Lore>Let's go to your Ice Cavern and see if we can find a way to break the unbreakable ice</Lore>.

Elsa_013_f&It's the only way we'll know for sure.

Elsa_004_fWhy do you think that?

Elsa_005_fIt certainly surprised me.
M

Elsa_012_f?I wonder if it has anything to do with the key I'm looking for?
