Elsa_000_fMHere's the chest that appeared. The more I look at it, the more I remember...
^

Elsa_001_fPMerlin and I used our magic to keep something safe for you at Jasmine's request.
K

Elsa_012_f=The <ActivityItem>Ice Key</ActivityItem>! I'm sure that's it!
{

Elsa_013_fmI think you may be right, {PlayerName}. Unfortunately, the ice surrounding the chest seems to be unbreakable.
;
Player_000_choice_000_f How do we break UNBREAKABLE ice?
B
Player_000_choice_001_f'I'm sure there's something we can do...
.
Player_000_choice_002_fWell. We're doomed.
+

Elsa_017_fWith a little magic, perhaps?
W

Elsa_014_fII suspect the solution will be found in those two pedestals by the chest.
d

Elsa_008_fVThere are symbols engraved on them: a sun and a snowflake. That has to mean something.
C
Player_001_choice_000_f(Have you seen this sort of magic before?
h
Player_001_choice_001_fMThose symbols may be pointing us towards somewhere sunny and somewhere snowy.

Player_001_choice_002_fDo you remember ANYTHING else?
5

Elsa_018_f'I think so. It feels... familiar to me.
B

Elsa_023_f4I... I think the symbols are telling us where to go.
?

Elsa_024_f1Maybe the Sunlit Plateau and the Frosted Heights?

Elsa_021_f&Wait... Something's coming back to me!
;
Player_002_choice_000_f I knew you'd remember something!
E
Player_002_choice_001_f*So you know EXACTLY what to do now, right?

Player_002_choice_002_fYES!
ü

Elsa_025_fêThose symbols ARE <Lore>hidden around the Sunlit Plateau and the Frosted Heights</Lore>. They're connected to the pedestals with Merlin's magic.
u

Elsa_026_fgIf you find all the symbols, the ice surrounding the chest should melt away, freeing whatever's inside.
ã

Elsa_010_f}Brilliant! Thank you, Elsa! First things first, I'll <Lore>take a picture of the pedestals here</Lore> to use as a reference.
Ω

Elsa_030_fÆThen I can <Lore>take pictures of the Pedestal Symbols around the Frosted Heights and the Sunlit Plateau</Lore>. I'll come back here when I'm done to see if the magic worked.
.

Elsa_019_f That actually sounds familiar...
B

Elsa_020_f4I... I think the symbols are telling us where to go.

Elsa_003_fYou're right, {PlayerName}.

Elsa_004_fOh, I'm not so sure about that.
