Flynn_000_fpOkay Flynn, so the good news is we have two Villagers who are interested in your book! Scrooge McDuck and Goofy.
S
Flynn_001_fDFantastic! Those two know a good thing when they see it, don't they?
€
Flynn_002_fqYes, but we have to remember that with each choice comes compromise. If you ask me, I think you should go with...
-
Player_000_choice_000_f...Scrooge McDuck.
$
Player_000_choice_001_f	...Goofy.
P
Flynn_003_fAMr. McDuck would definitely know how to make money marketing you.
A
Flynn_005_f2True. And I do want to sell a lot of books, but...

Flynn_006_f/This isn't supposed to be about me. Not really.
L
Flynn_011_f=This is a tough one, {PlayerName}. Neither feels QUITE right.
H
Flynn_012_f9There is a third option... You could always self-publish.

Flynn_014_f.Why didn't you say so earlier? That's perfect!
W
Flynn_015_fHGreat choice! And to kick things off, we should organize a book signing.
i
Flynn_016_fZI'll <Lore>purchase supplies</Lore> to set everything up. You take this time to get ready.
L
Flynn_004_f=Goofy is so loveable. He would add personality to your brand.
L
Flynn_007_f=That's true. And I really like Goofy! He's a nice guy, but...
L
Flynn_008_f=I worry he might get distracted, and that could impact sales.
