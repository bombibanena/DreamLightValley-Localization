Flynn_001_f/Hey, {PlayerName}. Need my help with something?
3
Flynn_008_f$I'm a man of many talents, you know.
A
Flynn_010_f2I could lower from the ceiling and grab something?
;
Flynn_009_f,Or maybe charm someone into giving up a key?
*
Flynn_012_fOoh, or scale a huge tower?
5
Flynn_011_f&Those are all Flynn Rider specialties.
>
Player_001_choice_002_f#Can you really do all those things?
I
Player_001_choice_003_f.How about lowering a drawbridge to a fortress?

Flynn_013_fOf course I can!
T
Flynn_014_fEAnd I've got the frying pan lumps to prove it. Don't ask. Long story.
K
Flynn_015_f<Well, I do need somebody who can help me lower a drawbridge.
I
Flynn_016_f:Right. The castle with the crumbling walls in Everafter...
c
Flynn_017_fTI tried to get in there once, but there's some sort of magic protection spell on it.
,
Flynn_018_fIt'll only open for a knight.
f
Flynn_019_fWYou know, the place sort of reminds me of a fortress from a story that I read as a kid.
A
Player_002_choice_000_f&Maybe it IS the place from that story!
X
Player_002_choice_001_f=Did you learn anything from those stories that might help us?
T
Player_002_choice_002_f9Apologies, but you don't strike me as somebody who reads.
…
Flynn_020_fvThe Lorekeeper told me this place is MADE of stories â€” the stories we all loved as kids. It makes sense, doesn't it?
†
Flynn_021_fwCould be. And if that's it, then maybe what I learned about being a knight from those stories could help us get inside!
i
Flynn_002_fZI used to read tons of stories about dashing heroes and brave knights back in the orphaâ€”
3
Flynn_003_f$Uh, I mean, back when I was younger.
Ž
Flynn_004_fFor a while I even wanted to be a knight... before I settled on being an extremely charming and attractive swashbuckling rogue.
J
Player_000_choice_000_f/I'd much rather be a dashing and heroic knight.
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/Being a swashbuckling rogue seems way more fun.
(
Player_000_choice_002_fWhy not both?
Q
Flynn_005_fBWell, if you ask me, I think you could totally pull off the armor.
ƒ
Flynn_025_ftAnd if we want to trick this drawbridge into thinking you're a knight, then that's the first thing we're gonna need.
G
Flynn_026_f8Every knight needs <Lore>a suit of shining armor</Lore>!
x
Flynn_027_fiYou know, I've got this old drawing I made once when I was a kid. Maybe you could make THAT for yourself?
V
Flynn_006_fGTrust me, it is. Only one problem. You don't get a great suit of armor.
u
Flynn_007_ffA swashbuckling knight? That would be interesting. You get to have fun AND wear a great suit of armor.
'
Flynn_022_fYou know, I think I did.
g
Flynn_023_fXWell, I don't have much time for it these days. Too busy LIVING adventures to read them.
m
Flynn_024_f^But as a kid? You bet I did. For a kid with nothing, reading about possibility was everything.
