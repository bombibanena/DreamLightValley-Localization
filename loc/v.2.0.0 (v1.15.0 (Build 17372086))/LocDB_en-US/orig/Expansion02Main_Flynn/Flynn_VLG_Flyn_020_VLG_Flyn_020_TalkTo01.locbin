Flynn_000_fFlynn? Are you okay?
:
Flynn_001_f+It's starting to come back... I remember...

Flynn_004_f$Me... kneeling at Maleficent's feet?
>
Flynn_003_f/No way. This can't be real. I'd never help her.
*
Player_000_choice_000_fHow can I help?
8
Player_000_choice_001_fMaybe it's not what it seems.
/
Player_000_choice_002_fYou're overreacting.
`
Flynn_005_fQIf you can think of a way to prove these memories are false, that would be great.
P
Flynn_008_fAListen, I have an idea. It might sound a little out there, but...
(
Flynn_009_fWhat if I talk to Ursula?
~
Flynn_010_foUrsula?! It's bad enough that I'm tangled up with Maleficent. You want to make a deal with the Sea Witch, too?!
A
Player_001_choice_000_f&She might have a potion that can help.
C
Player_001_choice_001_f(Maybe she has villainous intel to share.
C
Player_001_choice_002_f(She could help us think outside the box.

Flynn_011_f%Potions are her specialty, after all.
X
Flynn_014_fIFunny, I would have said her specialties are "lying" and "dirty dealing."
h
Flynn_015_fYDirty dealing maybe, but despite her, ah, flaws... Ursula isn't usually an outright liar.
C
Flynn_020_f4She might be able to help you recover your memories.

Flynn_021_fWell...
d
Flynn_022_fUAll right. Let's <Lore>talk to Ursula</Lore>... If you really think it's a good idea.
W
Flynn_012_fHIf she's heard anything, she might be willing to share that information.
I
Flynn_016_f:With Ursula, that sort of thing always comes with a price.
,
Flynn_017_fIt might be worth it, though.
A
Flynn_013_f2Seeing things from another perspective might help.
+
Flynn_018_fSure, but I mean... Ursula?!
X
Flynn_019_fIWith her knowledge of villainy, she could lead us in the right direction.
=
Flynn_006_f.Maybe... or maybe it is. UGH! I'm so confused!
>
Flynn_007_f/Am I? Because I think you may be underreacting.
