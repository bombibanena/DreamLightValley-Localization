Flynn_000_fxNo! ... Maybe... Let's say "concerned." Here's the thing: I haven't met Rapunzel's mother, but I know she's around here.
k
Flynn_001_f\And I've been thinking about the whole "locked in a tower" situation, and I was wondering...
G
Flynn_002_f8Do you know Rapunzel's mother? What do you think of her?
'
Player_000_choice_000_fShe's great!
.
Player_000_choice_001_fShe's manipulative.
@
Player_000_choice_002_f%You'll have to meet her for yourself.
d
Flynn_003_fUReally? Huh. I guess that's reassuring. Maybe I've been getting the wrong impression.
d
Flynn_004_fUI mean, how bad can it be to lock your daughter away from the world to keep her SAFE?
k
Flynn_005_f\You know what? I didn't like that even as I was saying it. It's just bad from top to bottom.
g
Flynn_006_fXThat's what I've been thinking! I mean, c'mon! Scaring Rapunzel just to keep her inside?
y
Flynn_007_fjBefore you say anything, I did try to scare Rapunzel, too. But that was just once! And I deeply regret it.

Player_001_choice_000_fYou scared Rapunzel?

Player_001_choice_001_fBut you learned better.
¢
Flynn_008_f’I wanted to get her back to her tower. And she'd said her mother scared her with stories about ruffians and thugs... So I introduced her to a few.

Flynn_009_fpThen she goes and tells them about her dreams. And I found out they like to bake and collect ceramic unicorns...

Flynn_010_f%She's amazing... She changed my life.
A
Flynn_011_f2Yeah. I have... Thanks to Rapunzel. She's amazing.
,
Flynn_012_fKeeping me in suspense. Nice.

Player_002_choice_000_f!Mother Gothel is hard to explain.

Player_002_choice_001_fYou'll understand immediately.
!
Flynn_013_f"Hard to explain"?

Flynn_014_f(I really don't like the sound of that...
s
Flynn_015_fdI hope you mean "you'll understand where Rapunzel gets her kind heart and joy for life from," but...

Flynn_016_f ...something tells me you don't.
