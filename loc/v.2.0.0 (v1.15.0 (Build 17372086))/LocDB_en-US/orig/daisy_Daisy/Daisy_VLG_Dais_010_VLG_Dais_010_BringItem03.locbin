Daisy_000_fWOh! {PlayerName}, you brought the <ActivityItem>Mochas</ActivityItem>! You're so sweet.
f
Daisy_001_fWThank you for bringing them. But as you can see, our housewarming date has been ruined.

Player_000_fI already talked to Donald...
I
Player_000_choice_001_f.Can you tell me, in your words, what happened?
/
Player_000_choice_002_fHe's really on edge.
r
Daisy_007_fcYou know, I'm not even sure what's going on. One second Donald was hammering two boards together...
Y
Daisy_008_fJ...the next he was flying across the room breaking everything in his path!
j
Daisy_009_f[I'm afraid I lost my temper before I even asked what happened. He must be pretty mad at me.
u
Daisy_011_ffI think he's embarrassed. He told me he hit his hand with a hammer, and that's when things went wrong.
g
Daisy_003_fXWhat really matters is what happens next â€” why don't we start by tidying up the House?
a
Daisy_012_fROh, that would be fantastic! Thank you for being such a good friend, {PlayerName}.
I
Daisy_010_f:He does his best, but somehow this always seems to happen.

Daisy_002_fkIt was going so well. We were reminiscing, laughing... And then we decided to build this wardrobe together.

Player_001_choice_000_fAnd then...?

Player_001_choice_002_f=Let me guess: Donald with a hammer is a whacking-ly bad idea?
^
Daisy_013_fOIt all happened so fast. One second Donald was hammering two boards together...

Daisy_014_fJ...the next he was flying across the room breaking everything in his path!

Daisy_015_fƒI'm afraid I lost my temper before I even asked what happened. I just wanted our date to be perfect... He must be pretty mad at me.
^
Daisy_019_fOI have a feeling Donald's more upset with himself. Let me go talk to him, okay?

Daisy_016_f9*giggle* Oh {PlayerName}, don't joke at a time like this!
