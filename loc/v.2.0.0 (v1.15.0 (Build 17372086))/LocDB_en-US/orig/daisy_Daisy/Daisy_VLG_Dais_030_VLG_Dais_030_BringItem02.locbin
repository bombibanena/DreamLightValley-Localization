Daisy_002_fLet's see what we have...
<
Daisy_004_f-Hmmm, this is not a question for "Ask Daisy."

Daisy_005_fWhat is it?
a
Daisy_006_fRA letter from Mother Gothel... challenging my competence to give advice to anyone.
1
Player_000_choice_000_fCLASSIC Mother Gothel.
2
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat do you want to do?
4
Player_000_choice_002_fShe might have a point...

Daisy_007_f*sigh*
v
Daisy_008_fgMother Gothel has always been difficult. The best thing to do is ignore her. She just wants a reaction.
,
Daisy_011_fSo you plan to do... nothing?
_
Daisy_012_fPI didn't say that. In my opinion, her constant pettiness comes from one thing...
Œ
Daisy_013_f}She needs to take the time to relax and appreciate life in the Valley. I imagine that could be difficult living in the Glade.
Ž
Daisy_014_fI bet if we made the Glade a more enjoyable place, she'd be more at peace. Then, she wouldn't feel the need to nitpick so much.
+
Player_001_choice_000_fI'm listening...
/
Player_001_choice_001_fLet's give it a try!
6
Player_001_choice_002_fI think she's a lost cause.
×
Daisy_016_fÇLet's make her a nice place to get fresh air. We can add some <ActivityItem>Outdoor Seating</ActivityItem>, an <ActivityItem>Outdoor Table</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Decor</ActivityItem>.
H
Daisy_017_f9She might not want our help, but she's getting it anyway!
[
Daisy_018_fLNobody's all lost. Sometimes they just need extra help from their neighbors.
q
Daisy_000_fbI know Kristoff wasn't exactly thrilled, but Vanellope got what she needed, in a roundabout way...
Ž
Daisy_001_fOkay, maybe I got a little overzealous, but it was only because I was so excited to help them. There's nothing wrong with that.
„
Daisy_009_fuI suppose things have changed around here. Before the Forgetting, my column was so popular. No one ever complained...
”
Daisy_010_f„...aside from Mother Gothel, of course. But she was always difficult. The best thing to do is ignore her. She just wants a reaction.
