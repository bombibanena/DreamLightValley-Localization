&
Player_000_choice_000_fSounds fun!
,
Player_000_choice_001_fSounds dangerous.
+
Player_000_choice_002_fCan you do that?
p
Merlin_001_f`Well, I suppose the leaping about can be a bit fun at first, but a squirrel's life is hazardous.
*
Merlin_009_fDownright dangerous, even!
e
Merlin_005_fUAlmost all the world is larger than the creature, and a good portion wants to eat it!

Player_001_choice_001_fHow to survive.

Player_001_choice_002_fWalnuts are good.
T
Merlin_006_fDYes, yes. That is a noble lesson to learn. What a promising thought.
j
Merlin_007_fZA practical and important lesson indeed. When life is hard, we must find ways to carry on.
X
Merlin_008_fHI suppose that's technically true, but not really what I was driving at.
U
Merlin_002_fEIndeed it is! The squirrel is a tiny creature with enormous problems!
W
Merlin_010_fGHow it's survived throughout the ages is one of nature's big mysteries.
M
Merlin_003_f=I could. Though I won't; not now. We have other things to do.
Y
Merlin_011_fIBut I still encourage you to CONSIDER being a squirrel. Think about it...
F
Merlin_004_f6The squirrel's life is hazardous. Downright dangerous!
