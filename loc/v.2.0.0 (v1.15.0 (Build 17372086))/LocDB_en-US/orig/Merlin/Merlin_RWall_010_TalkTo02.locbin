Merlin_000_fAWALL路E? Hmm... Ah, yes, I remember now! A charming little robot.

V
Merlin_001_fFYes! Plants are one of the many things that WALL路E enjoys collecting!
G
Merlin_004_f7Talk to Scrooge McDuck. He's a collector too, you know.
Y
Merlin_005_fIHe might have some bits and baubles around that you can bring to WALL路E.
R
Merlin_009_fBWho knows? Maybe Mr. McDuck's trash can become WALL路E's treasure!
S

f
Merlin_007_fVConsider bringing him things he might treasure... even if they seem like trash to you.
