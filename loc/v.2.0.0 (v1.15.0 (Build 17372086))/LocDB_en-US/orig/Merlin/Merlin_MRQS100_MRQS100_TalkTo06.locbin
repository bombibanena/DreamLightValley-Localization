Merlin_007_fm{PlayerName}... I suspect you're dealing with another matter that might decide the fate of the whole Village.
F
Merlin_010_f6But I suppose that's just all in a day's work for you.
\
Merlin_009_fLI found a certain surly lion in the giant skull in the Elephant Graveyard...
@
Merlin_011_f0... A lion? You couldn't possibly mean... Scar?!
Q
Merlin_012_fAThat's right. He asked me for help to restore the Sunlit Plateau.
£
Merlin_005_f’Be very wary, my friend. Scar is just as treacherous as Ursula. He's not working with you out of kindness. There's always something in it for him.
0
Player_000_choice_000_fHe seems nice enough.
:
Player_000_choice_001_fDuly noted. I'll watch my back.
\
Player_000_choice_002_fAHe thinks he's king around here and I'm just one of his hyenas...
I
Merlin_013_f9*sigh* {PlayerName}, trusting others can be a strength...
s
Merlin_014_fc...but only when they've earned that trust. Don't believe a word that duplicitous lion says to you.
U
Merlin_001_fEOf all the villains in the Valley, I have a special aversion to Scar.
›
Merlin_019_fŠHe refuses to learn my name, and insists on referring to me as "the windbag with the pointy blue head feather and the unkempt white mane."
(
Player_001_choice_000_fUgh. So rude!
<
Player_001_choice_001_f!... That is kind of funny though.
9
Merlin_021_f)Rude indeed. Now, what did Scar tell you?
 
Merlin_017_fHe told me that if I wanted to restore life to the Pillar of Nurturing, I'd need to fix whatever was blocking the river in the Vitalys Mines...
P
Merlin_024_f@The Vitalys Mines! Good gracious! I'd forgotten all about those!
;
Merlin_025_f+I went inside and explored them. They're...
#
Player_002_choice_000_f...huge!
$
Player_002_choice_001_f	...scary!
.
Player_002_choice_002_f...oddly beautiful.
Y
Merlin_026_fIThat they are... Hmph. I wish I could remember what was mined in there...
3
Merlin_035_f#Precisely! The fizzier, the better.
Y
Merlin_037_fIOf course, they only worked on the smallest, least virulent Night Thorns.
È
Merlin_036_f·But if you <Lore>use that recipe to whip up some especially fizzy <ActivityItem>Root Beer</ActivityItem> and combine it with the <ActivityItem>Crackling Candy</ActivityItem>...</Lore>
P
Merlin_032_f@Why, that just might be enough to stop this problem at its root!
w
Merlin_027_fgThe river's being blocked by the roots of some Giant Night Thorns that grew down from the cliffs above.
6
Merlin_028_f&My magic doesn't seem to work on them.
w
Merlin_029_fgI see. I see... Well, perhaps some more mundane substance could kill the Night Thorns at their roots...
ê
Merlin_030_fÙI found a note someone left tacked up in the mine... a bunch of ingredients lying around... some <ActivityItem>Crackling Candies</ActivityItem>... and a recipe for <ActivityItem>Extra Fizzy Root Beer</ActivityItem>...
H
Merlin_031_f8Brilliant! This means your job is already half complete!
a
Merlin_033_fQBefore you arrived, there was only one way we could keep the Night Thorns at bay.
:
Merlin_002_f*<Lore>Sugary, carbonated beverages!</Lore>
/
Merlin_034_fHuh? Really? Like... root beer?
s
Merlin_022_fcFunny?! Now see here! There's nothing humorous about it. Why, I ought to turn him into a house cat.
@
Merlin_000_f0Sorry. I didn't realize it was such a sore spot.
w
Merlin_023_fgYes, yes, well... I've gotten myself so worked up, I forgot the matter at hand. What did Scar tell you?
Z
Merlin_015_fJGood. The number of villains in the Village is growing. We must take heed.
F
Merlin_018_f6Oh, that's just like him. The pompous, lazy miscreant!
