Merlin_000_fP{PlayerName}! Oh dear, you look worried. Is there something I can help you with?

Player_000_choice_000_fI just need some paper.
V
Player_000_choice_001_f;Ursula wants me to sneak into people's houses to get paper.
K
Player_000_choice_002_f0Does helping Ursula get paper make me a villain?
P
Merlin_001_f@Oh, well that doesn't seem like anything to get worked up about.
v
Merlin_002_ffMany of our Villagers have paper in their homes. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to share with you.
;
Merlin_003_f+I'll just let them know you'll be visiting.
D
Merlin_004_f4Sneak?! How dare she?! ... Of course, she IS Ursula.
€
Merlin_005_fpWell, not to worry. We'll get this sorted. I'll simply let our fellow Villagers know you're looking for paper...
L
Merlin_006_f<That way you don't have to sneak into their homes to get it.
}
Merlin_007_fmWell, that's a conundrum indeed! On one hand you are HELPING someone, while on the other hand... it's Ursula.
L
Merlin_008_f<Of course, it WOULD be wise for you to keep an eye on her...

Merlin_009_foYes! Do what she's asked. But I'll let the other Villagers know what you'll be up to. Be careful, {PlayerName}.
