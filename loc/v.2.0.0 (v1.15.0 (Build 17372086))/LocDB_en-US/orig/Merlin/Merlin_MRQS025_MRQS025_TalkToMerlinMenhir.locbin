Player_001_fI have to find the Orbs...
M
Merlin_000_f=This Pillar is just one of many scattered around the Village.
ç
Merlin_003_f}For as long as I can remember, <Lore>the Pillars protected the Valley</Lore> and kept it safe from Dark Magic. But no longer.
@
Merlin_027_f0I'm afraid the Pillars are broken, {PlayerName}.
.
Player_000_choice_000_fHow did they break?
2
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat's wrong with them?
-
Player_000_choice_002_fHow do I fix them?
ä
Merlin_018_fzWell, you see, they're no longer whole. A vital piece of each has gone missing. And it's those pieces you'll need to find.
:
Merlin_023_f*...and others were stolen for their magic.

Player_000_choice_003_fTo keep the Village safe.
<
Player_000_choice_004_f!To restore the Village's virtues.
<
Player_000_choice_005_f!To get all that magic for myself!
Y
Merlin_014_fIEach Pillar once contained an <ActivityItem>Orb of Virtue</ActivityItem>.
£
Merlin_001_fíThe <ActivityItem>Orbs</ActivityItem> are filled with powerful magic. And each one stood for a virtue around which the Old Ruler built the Valley.
á
Merlin_020_fwThese virtues are some of the most powerful kinds of magic there are... Trust, Friendship, Power... just to name a few.
/
Merlin_028_fPower is one of the virtues...?
•
Merlin_029_fîYes! Power can be virtuous if it's wielded wisely... which I'm afraid it rarely is. That's how we've ended up with such a magical mess on our hands.
J
Merlin_021_f:So what happened to the <ActivityItem>Orbs</ActivityItem>?
=
Merlin_002_f-When our Ruler disappeared, some were lost...
&
Merlin_022_fSome were forgotten...
w
Merlin_024_fgExactly! As long as you keep what's best for the Village in your heart, you'll stay on the right track.
•
Merlin_005_fîNow, this Pillar held the <ActivityItem>Orb of Friendship</ActivityItem>, one of the most powerful <ActivityItem>Orbs</ActivityItem> in the Village.
Å
Merlin_015_fqThat <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> is now tangled in a Night Thorn fiercer than any you've encountered before.
é
Merlin_017_f~Since the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> got stuck, the Well in the Meadow fell prey to a curse and we can no longer use it.
Ñ
Merlin_011_ftYou must free the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> from the Thorns by proving that you have the power of friendship.
1
Player_002_choice_000_fI'm an awesome friend.
J
Player_002_choice_001_f/I'll keep bringing more friends to the Village.
;
Player_002_choice_002_f Haven't I proven myself enough?!
´
Merlin_006_föThat you are. Though a little modesty wouldn't hurt. Heh-heh. Now, just remember that while it's very important for our friends to return to the Valley...
e
Merlin_009_fU...we mustn't forget about those who are already here, trying to rebuild their lives.
5
Merlin_012_f%Small acts of kindness go a long way.
]
Merlin_013_fMYou know, like giving someone a gift just because you think they'd like it...
Y
Merlin_016_fISpending time together... What do you modern kids call it? "Hanging out"?
j
Merlin_008_fZSo, talk to the Villagers to get to know them. Most importantly, let them get to know you.
∂
Merlin_010_f•Once you understand this, the <ActivityItem>Orb of Friendship</ActivityItem> will be yours. Return it to its rightful place and the curse of the Well will be lifted.
b
Merlin_007_fRYes, yes, it's extremely important to get our friends back, but that isn't enough.
W
Merlin_004_fGFriendship isn't about proving yourself. It's about sharing your heart.
}
Merlin_025_fmThat's right. We can't forget what's truly important. When these Pillars are working, they help to remind us.
z
Merlin_026_fjOh dear. I'm afraid that if you're thinking only of yourself, you'll never be able to restore the Pillars.
T
Merlin_019_fDBy making them whole again. Find the vital pieces missing from each.
