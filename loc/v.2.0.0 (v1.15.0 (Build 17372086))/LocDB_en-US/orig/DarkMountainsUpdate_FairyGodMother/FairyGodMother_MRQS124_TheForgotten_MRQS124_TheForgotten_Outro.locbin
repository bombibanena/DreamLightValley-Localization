A
Player_000_choice_002_f&She led the Forgotten down a bad path.
`
FairyGodMother_003_fHThe Forgotten trusted her and she... she tried to do something horrible.
l
FairyGodMother_007_fTOh, I'm so sorry, dear. When we feel alone, that's often when we're most vulnerable.
š
FairyGodMother_010_fNow, I don't know if this brings us any closer to saving the Valley. But perhaps now you understand the Forgotten a bit better...
J
Player_001_choice_000_f/The Forgotten's pain is becoming so real to me.

Player_001_choice_001_f#I don't think I'll ever understand.

FairyGodMother_011_fMHow could the Forgotten ever trust anyone again after what Mother Gothel did?
b
FairyGodMother_012_fJOnce all this is over... I'm going to need to have a little talk with her.
f
FairyGodMother_018_fNTrust is fragile, dear. We must beware. Once broken, it's difficult to repair.
Y
FairyGodMother_015_fANow then, I'm afraid we still don't have all the answers we need.

FairyGodMother_017_fLBut perhaps we'll find them through this final gate. <Lore>Follow me</Lore>.

FairyGodMother_013_fTThe Forgotten never should have fallen for Mother Gothel's trick in the first place.
T
FairyGodMother_014_f<Nothing excuses all the destruction they caused around here.
b
FairyGodMother_016_fJPerhaps not. But we must always have compassion for those who are hurting.
I
FairyGodMother_004_f1The Forgotten learned a horrible lesson from her.
K
FairyGodMother_005_f3How to be selfish and use people for your own ends.

FairyGodMother_008_fmOh dear. I'm afraid that sometimes when we're hurt... it can be rather easy to turn that hurt towards others.

FairyGodMother_006_fuShe showed the Forgotten how to remove the Orbs from the Pillars. That's how the Forgotten learned about all of that.

FairyGodMother_009_fOf course... it's when we feel most alone that we behave rashly, trying to find any possible way to extinguish our unhappiness.
