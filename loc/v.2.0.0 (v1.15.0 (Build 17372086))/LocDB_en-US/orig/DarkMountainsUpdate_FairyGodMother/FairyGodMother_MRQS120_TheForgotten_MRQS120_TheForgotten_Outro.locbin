FairyGodMother_011_fBI picked up all the Memories... but there are some pieces missing.
„
FairyGodMother_000_flHmm, yes... these Memories... why, they're just pieces of something larger that the Forgotten meant to hide.
§
FairyGodMother_010_fŽI'm afraid the Forgotten has hidden something here much deeper. If we're to uncover it... well, it won't be as simple as finding the Memories.

FairyGodMother_012_fFI'm afraid you'll have to live the Forgotten's lost Memories yourself!

Player_001_choice_001_fI need to BECOME the Forgotten?

Player_001_choice_002_fSounds fascinating! Sign me up!

Player_001_choice_003_f:Can we get somebody else to live them out...? Maybe Goofy?
\
FairyGodMother_013_fDYes. But just in a sense. The Dreamscape only has the power to SHOW.

FairyGodMother_008_f@So how do I do this? How do I live out the Forgotten's Memories?
b
FairyGodMother_009_fJThe Dreamscape always finds a way. <Lore>Follow me and don't delay!</Lore>

FairyGodMother_014_f‡Oh, that makes me very happy, dear. After all, nothing in this world is such a treasure to find as an eager helper with a curious mind!
Z
FairyGodMother_015_fBI'm afraid that Goofy cannot help. This is a feat only you can do.
