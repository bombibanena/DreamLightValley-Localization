Donald_000_f Finally! What took you so long?!
,
Donald_013_fWait... you're not Kristoff!
`
Donald_012_fPAre you trying to steal the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem> from me?

Player_002_choice_002_fI'm here to help you!
M
Donald_001_f=Kristoff's still in the Valley? He should be here helping me!
z
Donald_002_fjI took all the risk following the Dark Entity to get the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem> back!
=
Donald_003_f-And I've been stuck in this place ever since!
.
Player_004_choice_000_fWhat is this place?
X
Player_004_choice_001_f=Did you find the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem>?
(
Player_004_choice_002_fAre you okay?
1
Player_004_choice_004_fLet's get out of here!
Q
Donald_005_fANo idea. It looks like the Valley... but much darker and scarier!
i
Donald_006_fYI saw a <Lore>Dark Castle</Lore> through the trees... But I have no idea who lives there.
`
Donald_022_fPOf course I did! I followed the Dark Entity, but then I got lost in all the fog.

Donald_008_f[They opened another portal and dropped the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> when they left!
x
Donald_009_fhI picked it up, but I couldn't find my way back. I thought Kristoff would've sent help sooner than this!
É
Donald_010_f¸Here, take the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem>. Since you made it here, I bet you can go back to the Valley and fix the <ActivityItem>Pillar of Courage</ActivityItem> with your magic.
b
Donald_007_fRDo I look okay?! I've been lost in a dark, scary forest for I don't know how long!
z
Donald_014_fjSorry... It's not your fault. Actually, I feel better now that you're here. Hey, maybe you can get me out!
(
Donald_021_fPhew! That's all I want!
ª
Donald_011_f™You gotta go back through the portal and fix the Pillar. Then, focus your thoughts, and its power should be strong enough to bring me back to the Valley.
J
Donald_004_f:Merlin! I should've known he'd be tangled up in this mess.
»
Donald_016_fªThen you know about the Forgetting. Kristoff and I were trying to stop it, but then the Dark Entity showed up and stole the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem>...
