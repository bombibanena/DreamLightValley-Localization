Player_001_choice_000_fWhat's the argument about?
;
Player_001_choice_001_f I'm staying out of this for now.

Donald_016_f.Goofy says he once caught a catfish in a lake.
6
Donald_017_f&But there aren't any catfish in lakes!
;
Donald_000_f+Goofy doesn't know what he's talking about!
K
Player_000_choice_000_f0He doesn't know as much as you, that's for sure.
^
Player_000_choice_001_fCGoofy's kind of goofy, but he's knowledgeable about lots of things.
`
Donald_002_fPExactly! He doesn't know anything about fish if he thinks catfish live in lakes.
:
Donald_006_f*Everyone knows catfish are from the ocean!

Player_000_choice_004_fYeah, catfish are ocean fish.

Player_000_choice_005_fI think catfish are lake fish.
A
Player_000_choice_006_f&Catfish are native to the supermarket.
I
Donald_007_f9Just like I said! But now we have to prove that to Goofy.

Donald_011_f/We're going to the ocean to catch some catfish!
=
Donald_012_f-And you better look like a real fisherperson.

Donald_013_fhIf we catch a real catfish, it'll splash all over. You don't want to get wet. Here, put these waders on.
F
Donald_008_f6What?! Grr... Now I have to prove you AND Goofy wrong.
"
Donald_009_fHa-ha! Very funny.
*
Donald_003_fI don't know about that...
g
Donald_005_fWBut if he thinks catfish live in lakes, he definitely doesn't know anything about fish!
‡
Donald_004_fwFine, but he's just gonna keep thinking he's right unless you come back and prove that I'm right. And that's not right!
