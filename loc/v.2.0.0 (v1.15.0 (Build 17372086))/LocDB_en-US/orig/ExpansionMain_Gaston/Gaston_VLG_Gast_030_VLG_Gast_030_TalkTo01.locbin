Excellent.
D
Gaston_009_f4Was eating everything raw really all that important?
O
Gaston_010_f?Yes! The food will cook inside us from the heat of our efforts.

Gaston_016_fOkay Gaston, what's next?
…
Gaston_021_fuWe must create a place to work our muscles. We'll build it from scratch with materials that we've ripped from nature!
S
Gaston_022_fCWe'd call that a gym. And you mean materials that I gather for you?
,
Gaston_023_fA "gym"... I like that name!
Ã
Gaston_024_f²Gather some <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Tropical Wood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Brass Ingots</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Stones</ActivityItem>.
;
Gaston_026_f+And see McDuck about a mirror. A large one!

Gaston_027_f#Do I dare ask why we need a mirror?
z
Gaston_028_fjYou disappoint me, {PlayerName}. Why would anyone work their muscles if they can't watch themselves do so?
L
Gaston_029_f<Ah, but how do you know that it's working without a mirror?!
T
Gaston_032_fDMake sure you also <Lore>find Maui</Lore> and invite him to our gym.

Player_000_choice_002_f3Nervous, but that has nothing to do with the shake.

Gaston_001_fGreat!
X
Gaston_005_fHWhat about you? Are you feeling all right after eating so much raw food?
W
Gaston_006_fGOf course! The heat of working my muscles will cook the food inside me!
@
Gaston_002_f0You'll need more energy than that, {PlayerName}!
