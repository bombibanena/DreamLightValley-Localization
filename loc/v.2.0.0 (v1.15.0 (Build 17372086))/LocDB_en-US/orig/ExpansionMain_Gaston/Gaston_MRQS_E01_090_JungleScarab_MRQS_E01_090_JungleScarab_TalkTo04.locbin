Gaston_003_fHow you doing, Gaston?
@
Gaston_004_f0Very well. I am returning to the Gastonian path!
+
Player_000_choice_000_fThat's... great?
C
Player_000_choice_001_f(I don't exactly get it, but yay for you.
 
Gaston_005_fIt is, isn't it?
r
Gaston_010_fbNow I just need you to find the Mirage Wizard's vault and get me that treasure. How goes the hunt?
„
Gaston_000_ftI'm working on it! I nearly have the <Lore>next piece of the Scarab Key</Lore>. Rapunzel has been a big help so far.
?
Gaston_013_f/Did you finish your part of our adventure prep?
 
Gaston_001_fOf course I did!
s
Gaston_002_fcBut I did it my way. I don't need adventuring supplies when I can scale a cliff with my bare hands.
-
Gaston_012_fI prepared with 500 push-ups!
G
Gaston_019_f7So when you said you'd help, you just did the opposite?
R
Gaston_008_fBHardly. I did help! I stopped us from taking unnecessary supplies!
w
Gaston_022_fgUgh, I guess wait here and <Lore>I'll come grab you when I've got both pieces of the Scarab Key</Lore>.
o
Gaston_009_f_Hardly. I did help! As the incredibly strong one, I'm now fueled to use my impressive strength!
I
Gaston_011_f9No. Flexing is always helpful to me and all who watch me.
 
Gaston_024_fOf course I did!
M
Gaston_025_f=I tried to think of what sort of food and drink you'd want...
&
Gaston_026_fHow thoughtful of you!
~
Gaston_027_fnBut then I realized that you probably have terrible taste in food and drink, so I ate four dozen eggs instead.

Gaston_028_f Okay, scratch that last thought.

Gaston_029_fActually...
D
Gaston_030_f4I thought instead of talking to the Mirage Wizard...
T
Gaston_031_fD...I would practice my flexing to let him know who's in charge here.

Gaston_006_fIndeed!
