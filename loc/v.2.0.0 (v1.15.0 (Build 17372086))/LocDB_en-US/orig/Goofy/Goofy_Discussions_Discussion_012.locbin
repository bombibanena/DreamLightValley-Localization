Player_000_choice_002_fBit of a fishy story...
m
Goofy_002_f^Well, I showed it to Merlin, and he said it's called a <ActivityItem>Fugu</ActivityItem> fish.
[
Goofy_003_fLI guess it only swims up near the surface on Dazzle Beach when it's raining.
[
Goofy_005_fLI tossed it back, but maybe you could try fishing for it next time it rains.
