Goofy_000_fYGawrsh, we never had Night Thorns before the Forgetting. Why do you think they showed up?
.
Player_000_choice_000_fThey're just weeds.
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/I think they're attracted to negative emotions.

Player_000_choice_002_fThey're probably a metaphor.

Goofy_001_fÄYou think? Well, at least we can get rid of 'em like weeds! Cut 'em down, dig 'em up, and make the Valley safe for nicer plants.
\
Goofy_002_fMHmm... that's an interesting idea. I know I'm unhappy when Thorns are around.
Ñ
Goofy_004_fuBut am I unhappy 'cause of the Thorns? Or are there Thorns 'cause I'm unhappy? Gawrsh, that's a pickle of a question.
_
Goofy_003_fPA metaphor? You don't say. And all along I thought they were more like a simile.
