Maleficent_001_fWhy, what's this?
,
Maleficent_002_fSome sort of invitation?
?
Player_000_choice_000_f$We humbly request your attendance...
E
Player_000_choice_001_f*Look! It's got green flame and everything!
(
Maleficent_010_fMy attendance where?
f
Maleficent_012_fRInk is still spilling all over the Vale. We need YOUR help to stop the Neverafter.
k
Maleficent_000_fWWe invite you to the first meeting of the <Lore>Grand Council of the Neverafter</Lore>.
:
Maleficent_013_f&Please meet us in the Library of Lore.
U
Maleficent_003_fAYou want me to descend from my castle and mingle with the rabble?
U
Player_001_choice_000_f:We NEED your help, Maleficent. We can't do it without you.
@
Player_001_choice_001_f%Do it or don't do it. It's up to you.
Q
Maleficent_014_f=I suppose you are all hopelessly lost without me, aren't you?
-
Maleficent_016_fI've only one question...
(
Maleficent_017_fWill Hades be there?
(
Player_002_choice_000_fYes, he will.
#
Player_002_choice_001_fMaybe...
H
Player_002_choice_002_f-If I say he is, are you not going to show up?
\
Maleficent_018_fHAhhhh! You want me to waste a moment more in the presence of that fool?!
l
Maleficent_006_fXPut aside your feud with Hades, just for now, please. You'll be the REAL guest of honor.
A
Maleficent_004_f-Put aside MY feud? Hades STARTED all of this.
h
Maleficent_005_fTHe put a curse on my castle. The ink appeared here before anywhere else in the Vale.
á
Maleficent_007_fsThat's strange. Hades told me that YOU started the feud, and that the ink started appearing on Mount Olympus first.
j
Maleficent_019_fVAnd you believe that fiery fool? You are far more na√Øve than I thought, {PlayerName}.
∞
Maleficent_009_fõStill... I will attend your little gathering and help you set the Vale right. But only so that I may remind everyone who is the rightful ruler of the Vale.
;
Maleficent_008_f'Hades cursed your castle? That's weird.
*
Maleficent_020_fI'll ask him about it.
u
Maleficent_021_faIf you think you can trust anything that fiery fool says, you are far more na√Øve than I thought.
Q
Maleficent_015_f=We invite you to join the <Lore>Guardians of the Vale</Lore>.
O
Maleficent_022_f;We invite you to join <Lore>the Lorekeeper's Legion</Lore>.
X
Maleficent_011_fDAn impressive parlor trick, no doubt, but what is the meaning of it?
