Scar_000_fWAh, {PlayerName}... So it's you I have to thank for leaving that mess outside my den...
@
Player_000_choice_000_f%This is GREAT pre-boss battle banter.
9
Player_000_choice_001_fEhh... yeah, sorry about that.
U

Scar_037_fGThat is a child's plaything. Did that sticky little cub give it to you?

Scar_038_f/Please don't let it touch me. It'll mat my fur.
J

Scar_039_f<Ha, see! Even you cower before the might of the Pixel Sword!

Scar_040_f)Vanellope and I will defeat you together!
T

Scar_041_fFHow quaint. Now, please leave. Your earnestness is making me nauseous.
+

Scar_042_fAnd what way is that exactly?
7
Player_014_choice_000_fThe way where you surrender!
E
Player_014_choice_001_f*The way my sidekick and I will defeat you!

Scar_043_fOIs there a reason you're speaking like this? It's even more inane than usual...


Scar_044_f	Sidekick?
E

Scar_045_f7The fish were a fitting tribute. I'll savor them later.

Scar_047_f'She wants me to "battle" you as a game.
Y

Scar_048_fKI mostly came along to make sure you don't decide she'll make a good snack.
T

Scar_049_fFNo need to worry. She smells far too sweet for me to even consider it.
_

Scar_050_fQStill, you let this precocious little cub talk you into provoking me? For a game?
@
Player_016_choice_000_f%Everyone needs to have fun sometimes.

Player_016_choice_001_fWhy do you hate joy?
>

Scar_051_f0I find your definition of "fun" rather pathetic.
`

Scar_052_fRBut you did say you came here for a fight? May I entice you with a battle of wits?
0

Scar_053_f"That's much more my idea of "fun."
8

Player_017_choice_001_f!Our fun helps you blow off steam.


Scar_054_fUgh, very well.

Scar_055_f0Then you have an odd way of releasing tension...

Scar_056_f,Running into danger seems far from relaxing.

3
Player_019_choice_001_fNothing wrong with that!
N

Scar_059_f@I certainly enjoy lounging by the pond in the shade on hot days.

7

Scar_062_f)Even though it's not loud and boisterous?
r

Scar_063_fdWell, we seem to have reached some sort of... d√©tente. But since I doubt you'll leave it at that...
<

Scar_064_f.I'll concede victory to you... just this once.
