R
Jafar_022_fCWell, you may not remember me... but I most assuredly remember you.
y
Jafar_024_fjThese crude devices allow me to speak with you, but I'm afraid they are not without their... malfunctions.
>
Jafar_038_f/Ah, at last! Our connection seems to be stable!
J
Jafar_026_f;Greetings. I am Jafar... Royal Vizier of Dreamlight Valley.
O
Jafar_027_f@Before the Forgetting, I was your closest, most trusted advisor.
F
Player_000_choice_000_f+Sooo... we're gonna be, like, best friends?
<
Player_000_choice_001_f!I'm listening... What's going on?
5
Player_000_choice_002_fI don't trust you one bit.
$
Jafar_005_f... Friends? Perhaps.
^
Jafar_006_fOBut I will aid you however I can. And trust me... you will need my aid, direly.
m
Jafar_029_f^I reach out to you now with a grave warning... <Lore>All of time and space is in peril</Lore>.
1
Player_003_choice_000_fWell, that sounds bad.
5
Player_003_choice_001_fEr... could you elaborate?
1
Player_003_choice_002_fOkay. How do I fix it?
`
Jafar_036_fQListen closely to my tale, and then I will tell you how to set the world right...
J
Jafar_039_f;But now, at last, I've found a way to communicate with you.
}
Jafar_040_fnIf we have any hope of saving Dreamlight Valley... you must <Lore>venture to Eternity Isle and free me</Lore>.
>
Player_002_choice_000_f#How did you discover Eternity Isle?
R
Player_002_choice_001_f7These ancient relics that control time... tell me more.
D
Player_002_choice_002_f)I'm ready. How do I get to Eternity Isle?
?
Jafar_044_f0It was fate... or perhaps a fortuitous accident.
m
Jafar_042_f^During the Forgetting, I began to assume my most-deserved role as sultan of Dreamlight Valley.
<
Jafar_043_f-All I wanted was to restore order, of course.
0
Player_005_choice_001_fI somehow doubt that.
F
Player_005_choice_002_f+Somebody needed to take charge around here.
V
Jafar_046_fGUgh. You sound just like that street rat Aladdin and incompetent Genie.
s
Jafar_045_fdThey refused to trust me, even though I was clearly the rightful ruler. They cast me out. Exiled me!
ê
Jafar_048_fÄBut as luck would have it... I found myself cast away on Eternity Isle. An island full of ancient treasures and powerful relics.
I
Jafar_047_f:Precisely. If only Aladdin and Genie had seen it that way.
O
Jafar_051_f@It seems Eternity Isle was once home to an ancient civilization.
n
Jafar_052_f_They studied the secrets of time and space... and filled the Island with treasures and wonders.
T
Jafar_053_fEYou will no doubt find some of them on your journeys across the Isle.
7
Player_006_f'Being able to control time and space...
<
Player_006_choice_000_f!Sounds like a big responsibility.
I
Player_006_choice_001_f.Imagine, being able to fix your past mistakes?
2
Player_006_choice_002_fI would be unstoppable!
L
Jafar_054_f=Yes, only someone possessing infinite wisdom could handle it.
=
Jafar_055_f.Someone like... oh... a Royal Vizier, perhaps.
B
Jafar_056_f3There is certainly one mistake I would like to fix.
%
Jafar_057_fThat wretched Aladdin.
m
Jafar_058_f^Ah, I knew you were not some fool who would waste a genie's wish on something frivolous. Good!
+
Jafar_059_fOnly absolute power will do.
>
Jafar_000_f/I will send a means of transportation to you...
E
Jafar_001_f6It shall be waiting at the <Lore>Stardust Port</Lore>.
m
Jafar_061_f^Take the <ActivityItem>Ancient Vessel</ActivityItem> and <Lore>travel to Eternity Isle</Lore>.
ë
Jafar_017_fÅOnce you reach the Island, look for another <Lore>Mysterious Device just like this one</Lore>. They will allow us to communicate.
@
Jafar_002_f1Where will I find this "means of transportation"?
Ä
Jafar_008_fqThere is a port of many worlds hidden here. There, you will find the <ActivityItem>Ancient Vessel</ActivityItem>.
q
Jafar_060_fbVisit the wizard, Merlin. He must remember by now. The old fool always was sharper than he seemed.
N
Jafar_009_f?Oh, but you really have no choice. The stakes are far too high.
Q
Jafar_028_fBBefore the Forgetting, I was the Old Ruler's most trusted advisor.
e
Jafar_041_fVIt seems you rule the Valley now. I hope I may provide you with the same wise counsel.
\
Jafar_004_fMYou may not know me... but I most assuredly know you. I have eyes everywhere.
á
Jafar_031_fxDuring the Forgetting, I set out on a journey and <Lore>discovered a land beyond the waters of Dreamlight Valley</Lore>.
.
Jafar_033_fBut then everything went wrong.
;
Jafar_034_f,A land called... <Lore>Eternity Isle</Lore>.
O
Jafar_037_f@Eternity Isle became lost in time... and I became trapped there.
