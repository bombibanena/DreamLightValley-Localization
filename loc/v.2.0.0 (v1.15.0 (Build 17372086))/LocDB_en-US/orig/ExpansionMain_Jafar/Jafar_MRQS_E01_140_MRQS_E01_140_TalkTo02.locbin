Jafar_001_f... "Bestie"?
[
Jafar_002_fLRefer to me as the Grand Vizier. Or perhaps, soon... Sultan of all I survey.
X
Jafar_008_fIBut I shall forgive your insolence for now. I have one more task for you.

Jafar_007_fWhat is it?
h
Jafar_010_fYThere is something <Lore>hidden deep beneath this Island</Lore>. A relic of untold power.
B
Jafar_011_f3It is called <Lore>the Spark of Imagination</Lore>.
&
Player_001_choice_000_fWhat is it?
*
Player_001_choice_001_fWhat can it do?
P
Player_001_choice_002_f5Let me guess... You want me to get the Spark for you.
‡
Jafar_012_fxI have only read the legends. But it is said to be the first spark of inspiration that drove the creation of this world.
J
Jafar_025_f;You mean... it's the magic behind all of Dreamlight Valley?
d
Jafar_026_fUAnd Eternity Isle. Dreamlight Magic may very well spring from this one ancient relic.
[
Jafar_029_fL*sigh* Let me guess... You want me to get this Spark of Imagination for you.

Jafar_014_fVery astute, {PlayerName}.
a
Jafar_015_fROnly someone wielding the Hourglass can reach it. I fear the path is lost to time.
¦
Jafar_009_f–After the way you proved yourself in the Cave of Wonders, I have confidence you will manage to find your way without making an utter fool of yourself.
E
Jafar_016_f6What exactly do you want the Spark of Imagination for?
3
Jafar_017_f$Why must you ask so many questions?!
P
Player_002_choice_000_f5I'm not risking my neck again without an explanation.
Y
Player_002_choice_002_f>You're totally going to do something evil with it, aren't you?
u
Jafar_018_ffUgh. If you MUST know... with the Spark of Imagination, all of space and time would bend to my desire.
h
Jafar_019_fYAt last, I could make the world the way it ought to be... and have my revenge on Aladdin.
^
Jafar_020_fOOf course, there will always be a place for you, my humble servant, at my side!
D
Player_003_choice_000_f)Okay, now I'm DEFINITELY not helping you.

Player_003_choice_002_fLet me think about this...

/
Jafar_022_f There is nothing to think about.
M
Jafar_023_f>If you will not agree to help me... then I shall do it myself.
‡
Jafar_028_fxWhy, you even managed to get through all of my puzzles <Lore>without asking for a single hint</Lore>! Most impressive...
U
Jafar_013_fFWell, if someone wise and noble were to have it in their possession...
R
Jafar_027_fC...the only limit on their powers would be what they could imagine.
