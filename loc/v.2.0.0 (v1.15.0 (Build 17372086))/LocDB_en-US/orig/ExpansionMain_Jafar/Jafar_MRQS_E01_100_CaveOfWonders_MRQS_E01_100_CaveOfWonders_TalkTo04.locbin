Jafar_005_f†The statue head on the right has lost its power source. Use the <Lore>charging station</Lore> within the room to obtain a fully charged <Lore>power coil</Lore>.

Jafar_008_f~Also, the dials on the floor tiles will let you <Lore>route the power flow to all of the charging station's connectors</Lore>.
