Jafar_015_f6Oh, that's actually kinda nice of you. How can I help?
§
Jafar_018_fîI have crafted four <ActivityItem>Imagination Generators</ActivityItem>, but I require assistance setting them up around <Lore>Eternity Isle</Lore>.

Jafar_008_f6I find false humility rather nauseating, {PlayerName}.
u
Jafar_014_ffI know that I am still not trusted, but hopefully this endeavor will influence some minds in my favor.

Jafar_019_fiIndeed. The poor fellow seemed rather upset that his experimentation impaired the geometry of the Island.

Jafar_016_fNo, I guess not... recently.

Jafar_007_fSo what did you discover?
X
Jafar_004_fIIt can be, if others are intellectually primed to share in the discovery.
A
Jafar_006_f2However, I am not convinced that is possible here.
