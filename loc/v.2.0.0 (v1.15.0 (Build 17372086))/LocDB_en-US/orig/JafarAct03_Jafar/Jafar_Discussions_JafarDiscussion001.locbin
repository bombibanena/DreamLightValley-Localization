Jafar_000_fQ{PlayerName}, tell me... What do you think it means to be a Diamond in the Rough?
@
Player_000_choice_000_f%Someone with potential but no polish.
7
Player_000_choice_001_fA precious gem in raw stone?

Player_000_choice_002_fIt means you're Aladdin.

Jafar_001_f
Precisely.
ì
Jafar_002_fÉThough how someone without polish is considered "worthy," I will never understand. Can one be truly worthy if they lack refinement?
B
Jafar_003_f3People can be great no matter where they come from.
#
Jafar_004_fHow generous of you.
3
Jafar_005_f$Generous... and perhaps a tad naive.
8
Jafar_006_f)Yes... But you are being far too literal.
Y
Jafar_007_fJA Diamond in the Rough is one who has exceptional skill but no refinement.
Å
Jafar_008_frHardly. It does not matter what the Cave of Wonders deemed him; that street rat is no diamond, rough or otherwise.
