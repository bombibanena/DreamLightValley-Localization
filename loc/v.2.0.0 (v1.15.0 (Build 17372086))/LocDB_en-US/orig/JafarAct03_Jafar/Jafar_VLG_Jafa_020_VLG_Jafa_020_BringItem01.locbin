Jafar_002_fI made some gold! Check it out!

Jafar_006_fHmm, I see...
 
Jafar_007_fPretty cool, huh?
'
Jafar_008_fThat is one perspective.
e
Jafar_009_fVPersonally, I find the pitiful yield of gold rendered from the process unsatisfactory.
2
Player_000_choice_000_fYeah, it is kinda tiny.
8
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat?! We got GOLD from IRON!
%
Jafar_012_fWhere did we go wrong?
™
Jafar_013_f‰According to my calculations, we should have gained a 1-to-1 yield. If that is incorrect, this does not bode well for making the stone...
I
Jafar_014_f:Hmm, maybe alchemy works differently in Dreamlight Valley?
Y
Jafar_015_fJI am... impressed, {PlayerName}. That is quite a well-reasoned suggestion.
<
Player_001_choice_000_f!Guess I'm more than an assistant!
*
Player_001_choice_001_fWhy, thank you.
H
Player_001_choice_002_f-You're not the only smarty-pants around here!
%
Jafar_011_fI would not go so far.
&
Jafar_029_fCool, talk to you soon.
L
Jafar_019_f=Dreamlight Alchemy... now that is an interesting proposition.
™
Jafar_017_f‰But it does somewhat invalidate my prior research... If we want to make the Gilded Stone, we will need more information... but from whom?
T
Jafar_023_fEWell, you're not the only one interested in potions and alchemy here.

Jafar_024_fOh? Do go on.
Ò
Jafar_025_fÂ<Lore>Jack Skellington</Lore> is an amateur alchemist as well! <Lore>Ursula</Lore> regularly works with potions, and <Lore>the Fairy Godmother</Lore> is something of an expert on the magic here!
:
Jafar_026_f+What if I go and get some advice from them?
1
Jafar_027_f"That would be... most appreciated.
P
Jafar_028_fAIn the meantime, I will test a hypothesis I have recently formed.
$
Jafar_018_fYou are most welcome.
l
Jafar_016_f]Perhaps the alchemy has also infused your head with vast quantities of hot air. That aside...
3
Jafar_010_f$Yes, though a trifling amount of it.
