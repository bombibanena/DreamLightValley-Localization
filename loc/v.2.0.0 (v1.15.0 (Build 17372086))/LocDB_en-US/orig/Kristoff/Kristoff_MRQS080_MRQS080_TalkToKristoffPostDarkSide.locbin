Kristoff_005_fhA <Lore>Dark Grove</Lore>? That sounds like the Valley's Forest... but darker? What could that place be?

Kristoff_006_f±Okay, there's no way you're getting through that thick mist without something to help lead you to Donald. It's too dangerous. You'll get lost. Trust me... Been there, done that.

Kristoff_001_f’You should <Lore>bring the feather you found to Merlin</Lore>. Maybe he knows some kind of magic that'll help you track Donald in that Dark Grove.
