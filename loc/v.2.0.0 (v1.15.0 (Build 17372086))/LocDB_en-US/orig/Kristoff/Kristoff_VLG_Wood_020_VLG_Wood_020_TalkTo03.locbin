Kristoff_008_fdWoody and I are trying to fix his Carousel, and we could use your help to figure out where to start.

Kristoff_001_fI'd be happy to help.

Kristoff_003_fOkay, I'm listening...

Kristoff_012_f¶I jotted down a few ideas. You'll see; it's pretty simple. If you gather these materials, you should be able to craft the <ActivityItem>Carousel Repair Kit</ActivityItem> in no time.
