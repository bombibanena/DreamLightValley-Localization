Mickey_000_fEGosh, {PlayerName}, things around the Village aren't looking so good.
]
Mickey_005_fMThose cracks in the sky are pretty scary. Is there anything I can do to help?
7
Mickey_006_f'Maybe you can. Does this look familiar?
t
Mickey_007_fdA book of fairy tales? You betcha. That's been in my House for just about as long as I can remember.
\
Mickey_008_fLWe think it once belonged to the Forgotten. Do you know the story behind it?
U
Mickey_001_fEIt's funny. Now that you show it to me... I'm remembering everything!
G
Mickey_016_f7When you were just a little kid, we read this together.
v
Mickey_017_ffAt first, I'd read it to you. And then one day, all of a sudden, you were old enough to read it to me!
c
Mickey_018_fSOh, and sometimes, we'd just make up our own stories to go along with the pictures.
/
Mickey_019_fI wish I could remember this...
­
Mickey_020_fœIt's a pretty special book. Lots of stories about brave heroics and evil villains. And everything comes out right just in time for the "happily ever after."
G
Player_002_choice_000_f,Maybe we can read it together again someday.
A
Player_002_choice_001_f&I wish things were really that simple.
I
Player_002_choice_002_f.Sounds kind of boring. Needs some more action.
M
Mickey_021_f=Aw, I'd love that! We haven't read together since... since...
t
Mickey_024_fdHey, now that I think about it, the last time we read this together was right before the Forgetting.
V
Mickey_026_fF... But... gosh, that wasn't really you, was it? It was the Forgotten.
K
Mickey_027_f;They... they left the book with me. They seemed pretty mad.
L
Mickey_028_f<But I think deep down, they were really sad about something.
;
Mickey_029_f+Gee, I hope you can help the Forgotten out.
Z
Mickey_030_fJMickey, the storybook... the magic coming off of it is stronger than ever.
\
Mickey_031_fLYou've done a lot to help. Now I'll do my part to try to save the Forgotten.
Z
Mickey_022_fJWelp, I guess if life was always easy, we wouldn't need stories, would we?
›
Mickey_025_fŠBut hey, now that I think about it, that's just what you said to me the last time we read this book together. Right before the Forgetting.
x
Mickey_023_fhOh, don't worry. There's lots of action. There's even a story where a hero pulls a sword out of a stone!
J
Mickey_002_f:Hmm... I know there's gotta be some kinda story behind it.
M
Mickey_009_f=But after the Forgetting, welp... I just can't remember much.
h
Mickey_010_fXHuh... ya know what? It's kind of funny. It seems like the more time I spend with you...
'
Mickey_011_f...the more I remember!
Z
Player_000_choice_000_f?So our friendship... it could help restore those lost memories?
P
Player_000_choice_002_f5Is this your way of asking me to hang out more often?
H
Mickey_012_f8I think so. I just know that memory's in me somewhere...
k
Mickey_015_f[No problem. A little bonding time for {PlayerName} and Mickey should unlock those memories!
9
Mickey_013_f)Ha-ha! That wouldn't be so bad, would it?
S
Mickey_014_fCI just know that memory's in me somewhere. We just gotta get to it.
