è
FairyGodMother_002_fwWell, Belle was looking for this object. It's called <ActivityItem>The Chronicles of the Ancients</ActivityItem> and...
V
FairyGodMother_003_f>Oh, yes, I've heard many things about that marvelous treasure.

FairyGodMother_004_fWell, we found it in a‚Äî

FairyGodMother_005_f&How wonderful! Belle must be so happy.
,
Player_000_fThe thing is... it's broken.

Player_000_choice_000_fShe's devastated.

Player_000_choice_001_f How would you feel in her place?

P
FairyGodMother_014_f8...and I'm sure with just a few items, I could fix that.

FairyGodMother_016_f‡Let's see... I'll need some <ActivityItem>Gold Ingots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Vitalys Crystals</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>, and a <ActivityItem>Sapphire</ActivityItem> for the enchantment.
C
FairyGodMother_015_f+Oh, that's great news! I'll go fetch those.

FairyGodMother_008_f&Now dear, you mustn't think like that.
K
FairyGodMother_009_f3But I understand that Belle is surely disappointed.
