Merlin_000_fKAh, {PlayerName}! Tell me: What did you find at the center of the blizzard?
Œ
Merlin_001_f|I found a secret chamber full of strange magical experiments. I think that I must have made it back before the Forgetting...
=
Merlin_002_f-How curious. I wonder what purpose it served.
<
Merlin_003_f,Oh, and that's not all. I found Olaf inside!
t
Merlin_004_fdOlaf! Oh, wonderful! Was the loquacious little snowman helpful in sorting out our magical conundrum?
=
Player_000_choice_000_f"Yes! He's helping me find the Orb.
U
Player_000_choice_001_f:I'm not sure yet. I need some more help with this mystery.
P
Player_000_choice_002_f5Not really. He got me to chase some squirrels around.
i
Merlin_005_fYBrilliant! I've always known that Olaf possesses unexpected wisdom. What did he tell you?
z
Merlin_006_fjOlaf's arms are missing. He says that the last thing he remembers is that they were holding on to the Orb.
g
Merlin_007_fWBut he doesn't know where to find them. He said something about... water having memory?
+
Merlin_008_fHe's quite right, you know.
‹
Merlin_009_f{That was one of the powers your Royal Watering Can used to have. It could <Lore>draw out the memories held by water</Lore>.
¤
Merlin_010_f“Do you think my Watering Can still has that power...? Maybe we could find out exactly what happened to the Orb. But I wouldn't know where to start.
„
Merlin_011_ftIt's always best to start off where something has begun. <Lore>Investigate the Pillar in the Frosted Heights.</Lore>
Œ
Merlin_012_f|Hold out your Watering Can and <Lore>focus your magic</Lore>. If there's anything to be found, that should help you find it.
d
Merlin_013_fTWell, I've always known that Olaf possesses unexpected wisdom. What did he tell you?
v
Merlin_014_ffOh dear. That's not the best use of time when a magical blizzard is threatening to destroy the Valley.

Merlin_015_foStill, I've always known that Olaf possesses unexpected wisdom. Surely he said something that could be of help?
