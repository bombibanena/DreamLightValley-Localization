JackSkellington_003_fE{PlayerName}, I've seen some very concerning signs around the Valley.
?
JackSkellington_039_f&Wait â€” what is that you're wearing?!
,
JackSkellington_004_fOh, this old shirt?
Q
JackSkellington_005_f8Yes, why am I seeing signs of my old nemesis everywhere?
W
JackSkellington_006_f>Well, you see, I'm the president of the Oogie Boogie Fan Club!

JackSkellington_007_fWHAT?!
Y
JackSkellington_008_f@He arrived in the Valley yesterday, and everyone just loves him!
5
Player_000_choice_000_fHe wants to meet with you!
S
Player_000_choice_001_f8I'm going to try to encourage more insects to live here.
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$Why did you ever have beef with him?
+
JackSkellington_009_fI'm not surprised!
1
JackSkellington_012_fShall I go grab him now?
K
JackSkellington_015_f2No, no, no. This is serious. I must have a plan...
'
Player_001_choice_000_fOh, come on!
2
Player_001_choice_001_fOK, I gotta come clean.
Z
JackSkellington_016_fAI heard he plans to get elected Prime Minister of Halloween Town.
^
JackSkellington_025_fEOh... how kind of her! What a lovely way to welcome me to the Valley.
j
JackSkellington_026_fQDoes that mean that Dreamlight Day was a success? Everyone loved their surprises?
-
JackSkellington_027_fWell, not exactly...
)
JackSkellington_028_fNot even Minnie?
1
JackSkellington_029_fWell, Minnie loved hers.
:
JackSkellington_030_f!Everyone else was... not pleased.
U
JackSkellington_031_f<You gave people a solid fright! Don't you feel a little bad?
=
JackSkellington_032_f$For frightening them, of course not.
e
JackSkellington_033_fLI'm the Pumpkin King, {PlayerName}. Inspiring frightful chills is what I do!
W
JackSkellington_040_f>Well, watching over every resident of the Valley is what I do!
9
JackSkellington_017_f What?! But I'M the Pumpkin King!
d
JackSkellington_041_fKMaybe let's stick to scaring the people who really want to be scared, okay?
¨
JackSkellington_042_fŽHmm... I suppose you're right. I wanted the Villagers to enjoy my frightful surprises. But it seems that being scared isn't for everyone here.
n
JackSkellington_034_fUHowever, since some do enjoy it, I already have ideas for next year's Dreamlight Day.
F
JackSkellington_002_f-Let's... put that on the back burner for now.
¸
JackSkellington_000_fžVery well... Oh, you should take this, then. I suppose I don't need this element of my research anymore. And take this, too! A special surprise, just for you!
&
JackSkellington_001_fThanks, Jack!
z
JackSkellington_036_faYou can stick with Halloween â€” at least people will be expecting something scary from you then.
:
JackSkellington_037_f!Yes, yes... I can work with that!
:
JackSkellington_018_f!Did anyone actually vote for you?
r
JackSkellington_038_fYBeware, {PlayerName}... next Halloween, you'll experience a fright you won't soon forget!
l
JackSkellington_019_fSHolidays aren't a democracy, {PlayerName}! I am literally the essence of Halloween.
[
JackSkellington_020_fBIf Oogie Boogie takes over, it could permanently harm the holiday.
?
JackSkellington_021_f&Jack... you need to relax. I'm joking.
R
JackSkellington_022_f9Oogie Boogie isn't in the Valley â€” this is all a prank.
#
JackSkellington_023_f
... It is?
U
JackSkellington_024_f<Yeah! It was Minnie's idea. She wanted to give you a fright.
E
JackSkellington_010_f,But... but that will only make him stronger!
D
JackSkellington_013_f+Well, I do want to make him feel welcome...
O
JackSkellington_011_f6A million reasons. Such as trying to kill Sandy Claws!
D
JackSkellington_014_f+Maybe that was just a big misunderstanding.
