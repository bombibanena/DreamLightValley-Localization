Merlin_000_f3Hey, Merlin! Do you know anything about time magic?
h
Merlin_001_fXI'm afraid you'll have to be more specific. Time travel? Freezing time? Making time fly?
n
Merlin_002_f^Uh... No. A sort of time spell with Sundrop petals that can help Mother Gothel keep her youth.
‹
Merlin_003_f{I'm afraid I don't. The preservation of youth hasn't been a field of study I've pursued. Why, just look at my beard! Ha-ha!
4
Player_000_choice_000_fIt's an impressive beard.
M
Player_000_choice_001_f2So... you DON'T know about an eternal youth charm?
<
Player_000_choice_002_f!I thought it was a costume beard.
7
Merlin_006_f'Well, I'm rather proud of it, you know.
Î
Merlin_007_f½{PlayerName}, I'm afraid I don't currently have the knowledge to help you or Mother Gothel stave off age. You might want to seek someone whose magical pursuits lie more in the vanity realm.
V
Merlin_004_fFYou've divined my meaning perfectly! After all, to age is a privilege!
s
Merlin_005_fcA costume â€” a COSTUME?! Hardly! I assure you this is all very genuine and earned with experience!
