Merlin_000_fN{PlayerName}! I see you've managed to mend the rift in time around the palace.
;
Merlin_001_f+Hmm... I suppose that means Jafar's free...

Player_000_f
Not quite.

Player_000_choice_000_f"I think he's locked in the palace.

Player_000_choice_001_f#It was all part of a bigger scheme.

Player_000_choice_002_fHe's kind of a jerk!

Merlin_002_f#Locked in the...? What do you mean?
1
Player_001_choice_000_fBut where do we start?
H
Player_001_choice_001_f-Maybe something like that should stay lost...
R
Player_001_choice_002_f7Just think of what I could do if I got ahold of that...
û
Merlin_010_fçJafar tried to take the Hourglass from me. But Rapunzel, Gaston, and EVE didn't like that. EVE almost gave Jafar a taste of her laser cannon.
|
Merlin_016_flJafar vanished. I can only guess he's hiding in the palace ‚Äî it's kind of his fortress. But before that...
]
Merlin_017_fM...he said he's <Lore>after something called the Spark of Imagination</Lore>.
F
Merlin_005_f6The Spark of Imagination? Why, I've never heard of it.
ä
Merlin_006_fzJafar said that it was somewhere <Lore>beneath this island</Lore>, and that only someone with the Hourglass can find it...
g
Merlin_007_fWOh! And he also said that it would give him the power to control all of space and time!
Y
Merlin_008_fI... Control all of space and time?! Then we've no choice but to stop him!
[
Merlin_009_fKWhatever this "Spark of Imagination" is, we must find it before Jafar does!
P
Merlin_011_f@Where so many good adventures start. With a trip to the Library!
X
Merlin_014_fHI must do some research. This may take quite a while. In the meantime...
p
Merlin_018_f`Keep uncovering the secrets of Eternity Isle, and do whatever you can to make it feel like home.
|
Merlin_021_flNow then, I wonder if <Lore>the Spark of Imagination might be connected to the magic of the Realms</Lore>...
v
Merlin_022_ffYou ought to try <Lore>venturing to one of the Realms and using your Hourglass to search there</Lore>.
`
Merlin_023_fPWhy, there's no telling what you might find... or what you could create from it!
Z
Merlin_012_fJNo secret can stay buried forever. If we don't find it, I fear Jafar will.
{
Merlin_013_fkYou shouldn't be too eager to wield power like that. You'll find it can be a great burden to use it wisely.
I
Merlin_003_f9Well, that's no surprise. Tell me... what sort of scheme?
_
Merlin_004_fOMy friend, he is much more than a "jerk." But what drew you to that conclusion?
