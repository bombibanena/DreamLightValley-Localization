Merlin_001_fcAh, {PlayerName}, marvelous timing, as usual! I've been exploring Eternity Isle and it's... it's...
S
Merlin_021_fC...well, it's a marvel! So much to study here and much to discover!

Player_004_choice_000_fI'm happy you're happy.
B
Player_004_choice_001_f'Just glad I have more room to decorate.
C
Player_004_choice_002_f(Uh-oh. You seem a little overstimulated.
Ñ
Merlin_022_ftHa-ha! Yes. That's the wonder of happiness. A candle whose flame never extinguishes, no matter how much it's shared.
Å
Merlin_026_fqOh, and speaking of sharing... have you discovered anything about Eternity Isle that you'd like to share with me?
B
Merlin_027_f2That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
í
Merlin_028_fÅI'm learning about how this <ActivityItem>Royal Hourglass</ActivityItem> works. But I'd love to learn even more about this place!
ò
Merlin_029_fáAh, yes, the Royal Hourglass! Quite the stroke of luck you've found it. No doubt it will help us discover all the wonders of this Isle.
®
Merlin_030_fóYou see, the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> in your Hourglass lets it repair spots where time has... well, I suppose you could say, time has broken.
¶
Merlin_031_fïKeep using the <ActivityItem>Royal Hourglass</ActivityItem> to obtain more <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem>, so you may uncover more of this Island.
}
Merlin_032_fmNow then, Mist appears to be connected to both <Lore>using the Hourglass AND caring for Eternity Isle</Lore>.
@
Player_005_f0No problem! To find more Mist, I'll just keep...
D
Player_005_choice_001_f)...decorating and cleaning up the Island!
B
Player_005_choice_002_f'...finding treasures with my Hourglass!
C
Player_005_choice_003_f(...uncovering the secrets of this place!
Ö
Merlin_033_fuThat's using your intellect! And I presume you've also begun to <Lore>uncover the magic of Timebending Tables</Lore>?
;
Merlin_034_f+Only a little... but I'd love to know more!
N
Merlin_035_f>Well, there's no better way to learn than to experiment! Here.
N
Merlin_036_f>I uncovered this Timebending Table while exploring the Island.
l
Merlin_037_f\Contained within it are <Lore>echoes of items which once stood here on Eternity Isle</Lore>.
ß
Merlin_038_fñIf you <Lore>examine the Timebending Table</Lore>, you'll see how to <Lore>reconstruct those items</Lore> with materials you find using the Hourglass.
E
Merlin_039_f5I look forward to seeing what sort of magic you work!
T
Merlin_023_fDYes, this Isle does offer more opportunities for that sort of thing.
R
Merlin_025_fBThough, I'll stick to my research and leave the decorating to you.

Merlin_024_fMDon't be ridiculous There's no such thing as too much intellectual curiosity!
