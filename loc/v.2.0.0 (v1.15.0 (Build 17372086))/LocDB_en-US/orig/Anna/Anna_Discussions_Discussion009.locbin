Anna_003_fqThen you should go get something to drink â€” right now! It's easy to get dehydrated. It's even happened to Elsa.

Anna_006_fƒYou would think that since she has ice powers it wouldn't, but it doesn't work that way. I have to remind her to drink water a lot.

Anna_004_fbOh, then you should do that and move around! Don't want you getting cramps or pulling any muscles.

Anna_007_ffI always stretch before Kristoff and I go hiking. Or skating. Or swimming. Basically, I stretch a lot.
