Anna_056_f&You can figure this out! You got this!

Anna_057_f...
u

Anna_053_fgOh! Hey! A person! I mean, of course you're a person, it's just that I â€” you know what, never mind...
<

Anna_054_f.Do you think you could help me with something?
€

Anna_058_frMy sister's somewhere in these woods. And in case you haven't noticed, everything is... kind of on fire right now.

Player_008_choice_000_fWho are you?
.
Player_008_choice_001_fWhat is this place?

Player_008_choice_002_fWhat can I do to help?
h

Anna_065_fZMe? Oh, I'm Anna. Actually, Queen Anna of Arendelle. (I'm still not totally used to that.)
 
Player_011_fYou're a queen?!

Player_011_choice_001_fThat's so cool!
C
Player_011_choice_002_f(Ooh, really? I rule over a whole Valley.

Player_011_choice_003_f!Should I bow to you or something?

Anna_067_f'Thanks! I guess it is, isn't it? But...
(

Anna_070_fPlease, just call me Anna.
F

Anna_071_f8I came to the Enchanted Forest to visit my sister, Elsa.


Anna_081_fI'm {PlayerName}.
Q

Anna_068_fCA Valley, wow. That sounds like a lot of responsibility. Oh, and...
0

Anna_069_f"Oh, um... No, that would be weird.
`

Anna_033_fRThis is the Enchanted Forest. Usually, the Spirits of Nature live here in peace...
<

Anna_044_f....but something's thrown them out of balance.
 

Anna_041_f‘My sister Elsa went to investigate. But she hasn't come back yet. I've looked everywhere for her, and now there's all this fire blocking the way.
?
Player_010_f/Don't worry. We'll find her. We just have to...
.
Player_010_choice_000_f...keep cool heads.
/
Player_010_choice_001_f...use our judgment.
,
Player_010_choice_002_f...work together.
a

Anna_062_fSFunny you say that. If my sister Elsa was here we could literally keep a cool head.
5

Anna_063_f'... Because she has magic ice powers...
6

Anna_064_f(Right. Probably not the time for a joke.
)

Anna_072_fJudgment? Right. Of course.
9

Anna_076_f+And what does YOUR judgment tell you to do?
.

Anna_077_f I am totally open to ideas here.
U

Anna_078_fGYou're right. This problem's too big for any of us to solve on our own.
N

Anna_022_f@I can do some magic. Maybe I can help solve whatever's going on.
Y

Anna_074_fKThat would be amazing! We need to find a way to calm the Spirits of Nature.
I

Anna_052_f;And we probably should start with Bruni, the Fire Spirit...
:

Anna_023_f,...so it doesn't burn down the whole forest.
3
Player_005_choice_000_fHow do you calm fire...?
6
Player_005_choice_001_fI'll get a bucket of water.
q

Anna_024_fcWell, first we need to find it. Bruni looks like the cutest little salamander. And it's really shy.
~

Anna_045_fpWell, I'm ready when you are... <Lore>Let's go get rid of all that fire and find ourselves a Fire Spirit!</Lore>
[

Anna_027_fMI'm sure it didn't mean to cause all this trouble. It's probably just scared.
(

Anna_000_fOkay. So let's go find it.
›

Anna_032_fŒRight. There's just one slight problem. Bruni's somewhere deep in the forest, and there are all these <Lore>fires blocking the way...</Lore>
7

Anna_046_f)We need to find a way to extinguish them.
E

Anna_047_f7Don't worry. My magic Watering Can should do the trick.
C

Anna_048_f5Magic Watering...? Okay, I'm just gonna go with it...
…

Anna_021_fwOh, and here, Elsa gave me these <ActivityItem>Fireproof Gloves</ActivityItem> so we can hold Bruni and not get burned.
.

Anna_025_f I'm afraid that won't help much.
