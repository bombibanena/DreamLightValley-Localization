Pumbaa_000_f9Hey, Pumbaa! Here are a couple of foods for you to try...
[
Pumbaa_004_fKOh, I'm so glad you're here! I was gettin' real worried... and real hungry!
A
Pumbaa_005_f1Wait ‚Äî what does food have to do with my aroma?
D
Player_000_choice_002_f)Eat the Onion Puffs. Then I'll explain...
B
Player_000_choice_003_f'We think you have a food intolerance...
/
Player_000_choice_004_fIt's cheese's fault.

Pumbaa_007_fNo problem!
L
Pumbaa_012_f<So delicious... But... Oof! My tummy doesn't feel so good...

Player_002_choice_000_f#Eating cheese is causing the smell!
G
Player_002_choice_001_f,I feel your pain. I can't eat cheese either!
D
Player_002_choice_002_f)Sorry, buddy. No cheese from here on out.

Pumbaa_013_fçNow, try eating those <ActivityItem>Gingerbread Cookies</ActivityItem> I made you. They're cheese-free, and the ginger can help your stomach.

Pumbaa_018_fVSay, my tummy feels much better now! But... how can I ever go in the restaurant again?
ô
Pumbaa_019_fàI'm going to help with that too. I also spoke to Daisy and Elsa. They had a few thoughts to help you feel more comfortable at Chez Remy.

Player_003_choice_000_fWhen did you last bathe?
6
Player_003_choice_001_fAnd I've got just the plan!
<
Player_003_choice_002_f!You'll be fine-dining again soon!

Pumbaa_023_f"Me? Oh... maybe a week or two ago.
(
Pumbaa_026_fI can't really remember.
L
Pumbaa_028_f<First things first, Pumbaa. I'm gonna get you a bubble bath.
X
Pumbaa_030_fHBubbles? But how would bubbles get you clean? We warthogs use mud baths.
p
Pumbaa_031_f`It keeps you cool, and when it flakes off ‚Äî you're clean! Gee, I could sure go for a mud bath.
N
Pumbaa_032_f>Hmm. All right, Pumbaa. I'll <Lore>make you a mud bath</Lore>.
L
Pumbaa_033_f<Thanks! I'm gonna go share some of these cookies with Timon!

Pumbaa_024_fOh boy, really?
N
Pumbaa_006_f>What's that? I tolerate all kinds of food! In fact, I love it!
w
Pumbaa_010_fgIt means your digestive system doesn't really like certain things. Remy and I think it might be cheese.

Pumbaa_011_f!Try the Onion Puffs I gave you...
A
Pumbaa_008_f1What? NO! Cheese would never hurt me! It's yummy!
p
Pumbaa_009_f`It's just the theory Remy and I have... Let's test it, okay? Eat the Onion Puffs I made for you.
