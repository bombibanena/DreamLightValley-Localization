Goofy_001_f!Really?! Gawrsh, that'd be great!
š
Goofy_002_fŠHere, I'll tell ya what happened... First I saw this <Lore>funny fish that looked like a robot swimmin' around Ancient's Landing</Lore>...
I
Goofy_003_f:I hooked it, but it nearly pulled me right into the water!
M
Player_001_choice_000_f2Uh... why don't you leave catching that one to me.
[
Player_001_choice_001_f@Just find some water skis and we'll have a new Village activity!
@
Goofy_004_f1Sure thing! I'll watch you and see how it's done.

Goofy_007_fThen, next I tried fishing for one of them <ActivityItem>Duneboppers</ActivityItem> in the quicksand in the Glittering Dunes...
_
Goofy_008_fPBut I lost nine fishing rods. And I don't think I'll be gettin' those ones back.
A
Player_002_choice_000_f&No worries. I'll handle catching that.
J
Player_002_choice_001_f/We could build a quicksand-proof diving suit...
N
Player_002_choice_002_f3Wanna try one more time to make it a nice even ten?
Z
Goofy_009_fKAw, thanks! You're a real pal. I can't wait to see what the trick to it is.

Goofy_014_ftNow, the last one's real special. I was walking around the Wild Tangle and I spotted somethin' glowin' in the water.
f
Goofy_015_fWIt was some kinda shrimp, but its shell was shinin' with all the colors of the rainbow!
A
Player_003_choice_000_f&Prisma Shrimp! I'll catch one for you.

Player_003_choice_001_fNow I've GOT to see this...

Goofy_010_f.Quicksand snorkeling... now that could be fun!

Goofy_012_f"But it does sound kinda dangerous.
o
Goofy_013_f`Okay, fair enough. Maybe I'll just handle catching that <ActivityItem>Dunebopper</ActivityItem>.
X
Goofy_011_fIGawrsh, no. Half the profits from my Stall are goin' to new fishing rods!

Goofy_005_f!Say, do you think that'd work...?
{
Goofy_006_flMaybe... but I guess we should try catching one before we try to invent a new water sport. I'll handle that.
