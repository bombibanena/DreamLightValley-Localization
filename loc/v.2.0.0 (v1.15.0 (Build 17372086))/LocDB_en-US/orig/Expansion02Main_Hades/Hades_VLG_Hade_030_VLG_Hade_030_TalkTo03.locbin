Hades_000_fqHey, are you ready for your public address? Just want to make sure we're on the same page about Daisy's deal w‚Äî

Hades_001_fTHE AUDACITY!

Hades_002_fOooh, okay then.
5
Hades_003_f&HOW DARE. SHE. TELL. ME. WHAT. TO. DO.
%
Player_000_choice_000_f
Calm down.
;
Player_000_choice_001_f That's usually what managers do.
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&And that's why I don't have a manager.
k
Hades_004_f\Seriously, you're not going to be a popular celebrity if you're always blowing up at people.
4
Hades_005_f%Okay, fine, fine, I'm calm. I'm fine.
J
Hades_006_f;*inhale* *exhale* Just gonna breathe for a bit... I'm good.

Hades_007_fFeel better now?
_
Hades_011_fPSo what did Daisy line up for you? She mentioned an endorsement deal with Goofy?
É
Hades_012_ftApparently, she's lined up a presentation where I show people how to cook food using ingredients from Goofy's Stall.
 
Player_001_choice_000_fCool!
5
Player_001_choice_001_fIsn't that... beneath you?
1
Player_001_choice_002_fThat'll be new to you.
ò
Hades_014_fàIs it? Because a cooking demo isn't really the impact I was going for... *sigh* But I suppose I'm stuck since she already advertised it.
E
Hades_019_f6What do you want to make for your little presentation?
@
Hades_020_f1Oh, {PlayerName}, haven't you figured it out yet?
N
Hades_021_f?You're gonna make it for me, and then I'll take all the credit.
.
Hades_022_fIsn't that what celebrities do?
/
Player_002_choice_000_fYou've got me there.
2
Player_002_choice_001_fOkay... just this once.
<
Player_002_choice_002_f!Fine, but I'm doing it for Daisy.
ø
Hades_023_fØOkay. Go make me some <ActivityItem>Spanakopita</ActivityItem> and some <ActivityItem>Olympian Tapenade</ActivityItem>. I'm thinking a few classics will really rev up my fans.
ù
Hades_024_fçAfter you get the Ingredients, go talk to Daisy. She's got a list a mile long, but as a celebrity, I think I deserve a little me-time, right?

Hades_015_f
Obviously!
[
Hades_016_fLThough, maybe if you excel at this, Daisy can get you more interesting gigs.
5
Hades_017_f&Hmm... yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
u
Hades_018_ffHey, I may not be the god of cooking, but I can toss around some feta and olives like the best of 'em.
q
Hades_008_fbA decision I am woefully regretting! You get it. {PlayerName}, you're familiar with regret, right?
/
Player_003_choice_000_fOnly too familiar...
-
Player_003_choice_001_fOccasionally, yes.
,
Player_003_choice_002_fI regret nothing.
^
Hades_009_fOYeah, I thought I'd left it behind in Greece, but clearly that didn't happen...
H
Hades_010_f9Well, guess I should take a curl out of your scroll, huh?
