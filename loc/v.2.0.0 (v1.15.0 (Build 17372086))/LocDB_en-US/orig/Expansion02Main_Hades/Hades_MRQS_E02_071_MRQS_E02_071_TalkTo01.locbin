(
Player_000_choice_001_fWhoa! Hades?!
@
Player_000_choice_002_f%Hey! I'm not your employee, you know.
\
Hades_005_fMHelp? Whoa, whoa, whoa. That makes it sound like I couldn't handle it myself.
r
Hades_025_fcLet's get this straight... I don't NEED help. I just EXPECT the respect I oh-so-deservedly deserve.
O
Hades_026_f@Look, I don't wanna brag but I'm sort of a big deal around here.
@
Hades_003_f1Name's Hades, lord of the dead. Hi. How ya doin'?
0
Player_001_choice_000_fHow did you get here?
1
Player_001_choice_001_fAre you stuck here...?
2
Player_001_choice_002_fWhat's your whole deal?
F
Player_001_choice_003_f+I need you to stop feuding with Maleficent.
=
Player_001_choice_004_f"What exactly do you need me to do?
í
Hades_010_fÇWell, it's pretty simple really. I was lounging up on Mount Olympus, ruling over my part of the cosmos, minding my own business...
J
Hades_011_f;...when all this ink started shooting up out of the ground!
h
Hades_012_fYThen everything started rumbling and BAM ‚Äî I'm here, in this place! Wherever here is...

Hades_047_f"What exactly do you need me to do?

Hades_041_fSee this cart?
ì
Hades_042_fÉHelp me get it across. It's got a bunch of <ActivityItem>Vases</ActivityItem> in it that are gonna look great around Mount Olympus.
x
Hades_043_fiBut let's face it: Right now, this place is a monumental mess. I mean, look at all this stuff in the way!
%
Player_003_choice_000_f
I'm on it!
N
Player_003_choice_001_f3You're doing all this for some fancy-looking vases?
$
Hades_045_fI like your attitude.
ë
Hades_034_fÅNormally, I'd send Pain and Panic to do my pilfering and plundering, but I've got no idea what rock those worms are hiding under.
`
Hades_044_fQAnd even if they were here, I've got no ferryman to get everything across for me!
J
Hades_035_f;I'm tellin' ya, it is so hard to find good help these days.
Ç
Hades_023_fsSo, uh, why don't you start by <Lore>giving this cart a little push</Lore>? Hope that's not TOO complicated for ya.
ë
Hades_046_fÅTrust me. Those, ahem... "fancy-lookin' " vases are really gonna tie the place together. It's a whole theme I've been workin' on.
F
Hades_027_f7Whoa, what? Stuck? No, no, no. You've got it all wrong.
\
Hades_028_fMI COULD leave anytime I want. I just don't WANT to at this particular moment.
7
Player_002_choice_001_fWhy don't you want to leave?
:
Player_002_choice_002_fYou're TOTALLY stuck down here.
:
Hades_029_f+Because there's something down here I want.
t
Hades_039_feAnd the second I get it, I'll leave, crush Maleficent, take my rightful place as ruler of the Vale...
[
Hades_040_fL...then, I don't know, maybe a nap, a nice dinner. It's gonna be a full day!
N
Hades_030_f?Once again, I AM NOT STUCK! There's something down here I want!
:
Hades_015_f+My whole deal? What do you want, my resume?
y
Hades_031_fjI told you. I'm Hades. God of the dead, Underworld, what have you. Soon-to-be ruler of the Storybook Vale.
Y
Hades_032_fJSeriously, what else do you wanna know? If I like long walks on the beach?
H
Hades_016_f9Maleficent? Hold on. Do not get me started on Maleficent!
h
Hades_017_fYPeople say I'M a control freak! I've got nothin' on Miss Mistress of All Evil over there.
@
Hades_018_f1It's your feud that's causing all these problems.
g
Hades_019_fXOkay, okay, I can see you've got an agenda. Whaddaya say we try a little trade-off here?
