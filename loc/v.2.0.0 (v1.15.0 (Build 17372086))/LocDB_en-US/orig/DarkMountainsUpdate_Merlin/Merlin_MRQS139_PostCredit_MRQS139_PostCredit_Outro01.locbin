Merlin_001_fl{PlayerName}! Just who I wanted to see... You've done so much for the Village. But there's still more to do.

Player_000_choice_000_fAll in a day's work!

Player_000_choice_001_fCan I take a nap first?

Merlin_002_f#Ha-ha! That's the attitude we need!
b
Merlin_003_fRNow, first off... even though the Forgotten has been pulled back from the brink...
š
Merlin_004_f‰...we'll still be dealing with the side effects of the Forgetting for quite some time. Why, already I've seen new Night Thorns sprouting!

Merlin_005_f'Too true. I'm glad you see it that way.
­
Merlin_006_fœThere are still countless Villagers in their Realms, waiting for you to bring them back to the Valley. And perhaps, in time, more doors will open for you...

Merlin_007_f˜Oh, and that's not all! Dreamlight Valley isn't the only place to discover in this world. There are many islands out there, each with their own secrets.
P
Merlin_008_f@One day, we may visit them all. Who knows what we might uncover?

Merlin_009_f©In any case, there's no shortage of secrets left to find right here in the Village. And I'm sure you'll keep making this a splendid place for all of us to call our home.
C
Merlin_010_f3The possibilities are quite limitless, aren't they?
Y
Merlin_011_fINo, I suppose now they're more a reminder of our triumph than of tragedy.
D
Merlin_012_f4Though... it's not quite time to celebrate just yet.
y
Merlin_013_fiOf course! You've more than earned one. Things aren't nearly so pressing anymore. You may take your time.
