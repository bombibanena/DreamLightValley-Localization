Gaston_024_f0Impressive! And that treasure will soon be mine!
a
Gaston_025_fQIf it's guarded by a giant cat head, the riches inside must be of enormous value!
5
Gaston_014_f%Gaston, I really need to talk to you.
6
Gaston_015_f&Now? Can't it wait until we're inside?
L
Player_001_choice_000_f1I'm going to try to break the news to you gently.
8
Player_001_choice_001_fIt's tough-love time, Gaston.
G
Player_001_choice_002_f,I can't wait to see your reaction to this...
`
Gaston_000_fP{PlayerName}, you can't break things gently. If you're gentle, they don't break.
O
Gaston_009_f?I'm more... a rack of antlers mounted on a fine mahogany panel.
0
Player_000_choice_000_fYeah, I can see that.
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/If it means you won't fight me on this... fine.
O
Gaston_019_f?I'm sorry, Gaston... but you can't come with me into the vault.
(
Gaston_002_fWhat?! And also... Why?!
a
Gaston_003_fQIt's part of the magic of the vault Ã¢Â€Â” only a Diamond in the Rough can enter.

Gaston_004_f... And...?
U
Gaston_005_fEYou're not pure-of-heart enough to enter. The magic would reject you.

Gaston_006_fI understand.

Gaston_007_fReally?
?
Gaston_008_f/Of course. I'm clearly no Diamond in the Rough.
b
Gaston_010_fRIt is obvious, isn't it? Manly energy wafts off me like desperation off a peasant.
@
Gaston_020_f0Wow, I suddenly can't wait to get away from you.
D
Gaston_012_f4Make sure you bring back buckets of treasure for me!
M
Gaston_013_f=You couldn't handle me in a fight. I'm the best at wrestling!
4
Gaston_011_f$All right, I guess I'll head inside.
3
Gaston_016_f#Well, I am tough, and I do love it.
6
Gaston_001_f&You can't come with me into the vault.

Gaston_017_fNo one reacts like Gaston!
T
Gaston_018_fDYou get to wait outside while I explore the vault and its treasures.
