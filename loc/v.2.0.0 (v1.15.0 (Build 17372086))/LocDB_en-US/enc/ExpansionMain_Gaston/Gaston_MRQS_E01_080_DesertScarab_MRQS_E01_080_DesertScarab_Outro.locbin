Gaston_001_fMDo you want to move forward by helping me find the other piece of the Scarab?
P
Gaston_016_f@Not now. I need to do rugged and manly things for a while first.

Gaston_019_f/Testing my mettle against the forces of nature.
#
Gaston_020_fThat sort of thing.
(
Gaston_021_fGood... luck... I guess?
i
Gaston_003_fYPerhaps as I gaze stoically at the landscape, I'll catch sight of the other Scarab piece!

F
Gaston_034_f6Why do you care what I think of Coconut LeFou, anyway?
v
Gaston_006_ffI don't. I only care what I think! But... when I got back to my encampment, it became far too clear...

Gaston_009_f%I've strayed from the Gastonian path.
ç
Gaston_011_f}It's time for me to take up my impressive pursuits again and stop whittling like some pitiful carpenter. I must move forward!

0
Gaston_008_f "SCARAB," Gaston, and yes I did.
m
Gaston_005_f]I guess I can explore a little in the meantime and see what secrets Eternity Isle might have.
Å
Gaston_004_fqI guess I can check out the Wild Tangle in the meantime and see if I can get a lead on the Jewel of Time there...

Gaston_030_f$It WOULD be shameful if it was true.
Y
Gaston_031_fIBut it ISN'T! As ruler of Gastonia, I have no need for childish comforts.

Gaston_032_fUh huh. Sure.
