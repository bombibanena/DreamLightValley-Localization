Gaston_012_fGaston... Is this...? LEFOU?!
A
Gaston_005_f1I... um... Oh, I was wondering where I left that.
4
Player_000_choice_000_fYou WERE lonely out here!
+
Player_000_choice_001_fOne word: Why???
"
Gaston_013_fMe, lonely? Never!
q
Gaston_010_faI made this LeFou... to pass the time, nothing more. Though it is an improvement on the original.
U
Gaston_015_fERecreating your sidekick seems like a thing a lonely person would do.
—
Gaston_019_f†{PlayerName}... if I had been feeling lonely, wouldn't making a LeFou out of coconuts and talking to it every day make me MORE lonely?
E
Player_005_choice_000_f*No, a coconut LeFou would have helped you.
:
Player_005_choice_001_fActually, that does make sense.
J
Player_005_choice_002_f/Honestly, when it comes to you, I have no idea.
O
Gaston_002_f?Hardly. It didn't help at all, and I feel as marvelous as ever!
H
Gaston_031_f8All I've found is sand and the occasional piece of junk.
4
Gaston_036_f$Oh, and a chunk of an odd metal bug.
+
Player_002_choice_000_fExcuse me, what?
9
Player_002_choice_001_fA metal bug? Like a... scarab?
=
Gaston_028_f-Yes... you're clearly doing great out here...
\
Gaston_046_fLWell, I'm going back to my encampment. That quicksand damaged LeFou's paint.
O
Gaston_024_f?Whoa, you can't be serious Ã¢Â€Â” what about the Jewel of Time?
…
Gaston_025_fuThe Jewel the wizard made up, which can only be found with a vault key that likely doesn't exist? Proceed without me.
™
Gaston_030_fˆI've been thinking... Even if there WAS treasure to be had, what does it matter? There's nothing here to spend it on, no one to impress.

Gaston_020_foUgh! If you won't help me directly, can you at least tell me a little more about this Scarab Key you mentioned?
¥
Gaston_021_f”*sigh* Fine... The Mirage Wizard said it's in two pieces, shaped like a Scarab, and when you put the pieces together, it will lead you to the vault.
?
Gaston_029_f/And?! Were you able to find any clues about it?
#
Gaston_038_fI SAID "METAL BUG"!
.
Gaston_039_fDo you have sand in your ears?
E
Gaston_041_f5Gaston... describe for me what you think a scarab is.
L
Gaston_042_f<You know, a scarab. Long, hollow thing you store a sword in.
G
Player_003_choice_000_f,I... don't even know how to respond to that.
T
Player_003_choice_001_f9SCABBARD, Gaston, that's called a scabbard, not a scarab.
O
Gaston_043_f?A scarab is a desert beetle. Just like the metal one you found!
(
Gaston_044_f... That can't be right.
3
Player_004_choice_000_fI assure you that it is.
&
Player_004_choice_001_fNever mind.
S
Gaston_045_fCYou go hang out with your... uh... Coconut LeFou. I'll handle this.
W
Gaston_000_fGFine. By the way, I threw the bug somewhere in <Lore>the Plains</Lore>.
z
Gaston_001_fjProbably in one of the time thingies. But since you got through those Time Rifts, I'm sure you'll find it.
v
Gaston_032_ffYeah, don't worry; I've got the right tool for this. My <Lore>Hourglass should help me find it</Lore>.

Gaston_040_fNo.
G
Gaston_003_f7Of course it does. No one makes more sense than Gaston.
?
Gaston_004_f/That's because I'm both mysterious and dashing.
Z
Gaston_037_fJI'd go with "confusing" and "frustrating" but let's not get sidetracked...
i
Gaston_011_fYOh, LeFou here has been a... project. Keeping my mind sharp during my time in the desert.
Y
Gaston_048_fIThank you for finding him, {PlayerName}. Let's never speak of this again.
x
Gaston_014_fhWell... as long as we can get back to trying to find the <Lore>vault key</Lore> for the Jewel of Time...
X
Gaston_022_fHYou go ahead. I think "LeFou" and I will head back to my encampment now.
L
Gaston_023_f<His paint clearly needs refreshing after all that quicksand.
