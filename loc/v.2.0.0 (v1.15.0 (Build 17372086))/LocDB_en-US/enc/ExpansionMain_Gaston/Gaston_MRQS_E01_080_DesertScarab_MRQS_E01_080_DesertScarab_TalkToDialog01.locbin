Gaston_019_f+Here we are Ã¢Â€Â” the capital of Gastonia!
o
Gaston_005_f_Great, can we PLEASE focus now? What are you doing here in the Glittering Dunes... or Gastonia?
d
Gaston_006_fTWell, if you were familiar with heroism, you'd know that heroes always go on quests.
>
Player_000_choice_000_f#Oh, I'm quite familiar with quests.
'
Player_000_choice_001_fSure, go on.
:
Gaston_003_f*Strange; you don't look like a hero to me.
t
Gaston_004_fdAnyway... back home, whenever I was out doing heroic deeds, my lackey LeFou was always by my side...
B
Gaston_001_f2Lackey? This LeFou sounds more like your sidekick.
€
Gaston_002_fpSidekick? LeFou can be bothersome, but I've never felt the need to kick him in the side. That might hurt my toe.
,
Gaston_022_fNo no, a sidekick is like...
€
Gaston_023_fpA friend that helps you out with stuff. They tend to be smaller and very emotionally involved with your success.
/
Gaston_024_fOh! Then... yes, LeFou is that!
c
Gaston_025_fSLeFou... my sidekick. I like it! And now YOU can play that part for me on my quest!
.
Player_001_choice_000_fWhat quest is that?
9
Player_001_choice_001_fI think I have hero potential!
8
Player_001_choice_002_fHow about you be MY sidekick?
/
Gaston_007_fMy quest for the Mirage Wizard!
q
Gaston_009_faHave you met him? Carries a snake-headed staff, uses too many long words, a little see-through...
/
Gaston_010_fOh, you're talking about Jafar!
<
Gaston_011_f,Is that his name? "Mirage Wizard" is better.
Ã
Gaston_012_f²I started seeing him after I established Gastonia. He asked that I find something called the <ActivityItem>Jewel of Time</ActivityItem> for him. Of course, I never work for free.
Š
Gaston_013_fzSo, he said this "Jewel of Time" was hidden inside a vault filled with treasure, and that I could have all but that Jewel.
C
Gaston_000_f3So the <Lore>Jewel of Time</Lore> is in that vault!
A
Player_002_choice_000_f&I wish Jafar had told me about this...
6
Player_002_choice_001_fThis is actually helpful...
8
Player_002_choice_002_fHow do we get into the vault?
ˆ
Gaston_008_fxThere's one problem... We must <Lore>find the key to the vault first</Lore> and... the key refuses to be found anywhere!
}
Gaston_015_fmMaybe we should check everywhere you looked again. Retrace your steps? Two pairs of eyes are better than one.
†
Gaston_017_fvHmm... I'm thinking... *gasp* I know! We'll retrace my steps! You can start by checking around this camp while I rest.

Gaston_018_foUgh! YouÃ¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â” ... Fine! I'll take a look around and <Lore>see if I can find anything unusual</Lore>...
T
Gaston_014_fDHa-ha-ha! You're hilarious... and wrong. How you remind me of LeFou.
7
Gaston_026_f'Back on task. What "quest" were you on?
i
Gaston_016_fYYou JUST said a sidekick is SMALLER than the hero Ã¢Â€Â” and you're MUCH smaller than me.
N
Gaston_020_f>WOW. You actually put something together with logic. GOOD ONE.
;
Gaston_021_f+Impressive, I know. Everything about me is.
