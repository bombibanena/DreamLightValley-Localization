Donald_022_fpHey Donald, I found a sign with a picture of you in the Peaceful Meadow. But it looks like someone drew on it...
S
Donald_000_fCWAK! What's the big idea?! Who wouldÃ¢Â€Â” Oh, I know who it was...
a
Donald_002_fQIt was Stitch! If he does that again... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... WAAAAAAAKKKK!!!

Player_000_choice_000_fCalm down. Take a deep breath.
8
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat's wrong? How can I help?
@
Player_000_choice_002_f%Maybe I should just stay out of this.
4
Donald_003_f$Calm down?! Why should I calm down?!
G
Donald_004_f7Every time I turn around, Stitch wrecks something else.
:
Donald_007_f*What did Stitch do to get you so riled up?
€
Donald_008_fpFirst, he won't stop bothering me. Leaving teeth marks in my pontoon, stealing the worms out of my tackle box...
A
Donald_009_f1And then he asked me if I was ugly as a duckling!
u
Donald_010_feI think you might have misunderstood Stitch. See, one of his favorite stories is the Ugly Duckling...
G
Donald_011_f7I didn't misunderstand anything! He's got it in for me.
l
Donald_012_f\So I put up those signs around the Village to tell Stitch to keep out of my favorite places.
G
Player_001_choice_000_f,Smart idea. Good fences make good neighbors.
H
Player_001_choice_001_f-That's not nice. The Village is for everyone.
5
Player_001_choice_002_fDid Stitch obey the signs?
L
Donald_013_f<Exactly! That way, we won't have any more misunderstandings.
H
Donald_014_f8But did Stitch follow the signs? No! Not once! Not ever!
H
Donald_018_f8But that's not all. He drew funny pictures all over 'em.
f
Donald_019_fVMaybe I can <Lore>talk to Stitch</Lore> and try to teach him to respect your property.

THANK YOU!
r
Donald_021_fbIf Stitch doesn't leave me alone, I'm gonna fix up that spaceship of his and send him to the moon.
n
Donald_015_f^Exactly! And I like sharing the Village with everybody who behaves. But Stitch doesn't behave!
/
Donald_016_fHe won't even follow the signs.
<
Donald_017_f,Of course not! He didn't follow any of them.
L
Donald_005_f<Finally! Somebody around here wants to help me for a change.
_
Donald_006_fOI keep telling everybody we have a Stitch problem, but does anybody listen? No!
=
Donald_001_f-Stay out of it?! You can't! I need your help.
