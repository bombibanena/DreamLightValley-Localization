Remy_000_fkRemy! I'm helping Pumbaa solve a mystery... Can you tell me what his favorite foods are at your restaurant?
Ã

Remy_005_f´I'd be happy to! Let's see... since Timon and Pumbaa got back, Pumbaa's really loved the <Lore>Cheese Platter</Lore>, <Lore>Macaroni and Cheese</Lore>, and <Lore>Cheesecake</Lore>.

Player_000_choice_000_fSo... Cheese EVERYTHING.

Player_000_choice_002_fPumbaa is living my dream life.

Player_000_choice_003_f(What do all these things have in common?


Remy_008_fYep. Pretty much.
¦

Remy_012_f—I think this is the clue I'm looking for. Pumbaa didn't eat ANY cheese in the jungle Ã¢Â€Â” and now he's eating lots and his body isn't happy about it.
À

Remy_009_f±I hate to say it but... he HAS had a bit of an effect on my customers. I don't want to stop him from dining at my place, but I do want to be respectful of everyone's experience.

Remy_013_f9Maybe we can find Pumbaa some cheese-free meals to enjoy?

Player_002_choice_000_fIt's a win-win solution!

Player_002_choice_001_fNo more aroma ÃƒÂ  la Pumbaa.
?
Player_002_choice_002_f$Food without cheese seems pointless.
'

Remy_015_fI like the way you think.
)

Remy_017_fAnd I know just what to do!
À

Remy_018_f±First, we'll cook some <ActivityItem>Onion Puffs</ActivityItem>. Those have cheese in them, so we can test to see whether it's cheese that's really upsetting Pumbaa's digestion.
å

Remy_019_fÖIf we're right, we can make some <ActivityItem>Gingerbread Cookies</ActivityItem> to calm his stomach and some <ActivityItem>Roasted Asparagus</ActivityItem> to show him a delicious meal that's totally cheese-free!

Remy_020_fYou've got it, chef!

Remy_021_f,Here are the recipes you'll need. Good luck!

Remy_014_fRight! So long, Eau de Fromage!
U

Remy_016_fGTrust me. There are LOTS of excellent dishes that don't include cheese.

Remy_007_fPMine too. You should see how many incredible cheeses there are to try in France!


Remy_010_fqIt's cheese, {PlayerName}! Pumbaa loves cheese Ã¢Â€Â” and I don't blame him. It's a staple of MANY fine cuisines.
