MotherGothel_001_f$Mother Gothel? What's going on here?
J
MotherGothel_002_f4Well, I was hoping to have a quiet moment to myself.
7
MotherGothel_003_f!But clearly you have other plans.
/
MotherGothel_004_fThat's not what I mean...
B
MotherGothel_005_f,Why is Little Louis in a cage in your House?
D
MotherGothel_006_f.Little Louis? Do you mean that reptilian pest?

Player_000_choice_000_fYes!
+
Player_000_choice_001_fHe's not a pest.
5
Player_000_choice_002_fThis is low, even for you.
d
MotherGothel_016_fNIt's quite simple, {PlayerName}. Your "Little Louis" was destroying my garden.
Q
MotherGothel_007_f;So, I simply did what one does with pests √¢¬Ä¬î trap them.
g
MotherGothel_008_fQMaybe we can come to an understanding. What if Tiana and I make you a new garden?
_
MotherGothel_009_fIAnd then I let the pest out and it destroys my garden again? I think not.
Y
Player_001_choice_000_f>You know, living in a tree naturally exposes one to animals...
a
Player_001_choice_001_fFThis is quite the overreaction for an animal getting into your garden.
S
Player_001_choice_002_f8You seem determined to find fault in everything I say...
H
MotherGothel_019_f2And clearly, I am more important than the animals!
V
MotherGothel_010_f@Okay, fine. What if we set up some fences to protect the garden?
2
MotherGothel_011_fThat could be... acceptable.
E
MotherGothel_012_f/Great! What did you have in your garden before?
≠
MotherGothel_013_fñIt was a mix of vegetable plots √¢¬Ä¬î <ActivityItem>Okra</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Rice</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Spinach</ActivityItem>.
ê
MotherGothel_014_fzAs for the fencing, I want <ActivityItem>White Picket Fences</ActivityItem>. That MIGHT keep my garden safe in the future.
Ä
MotherGothel_022_fjHere √¢¬Ä¬î take this. If I have to wait for you to gather everything yourself, I'll be waiting for years!
9
MotherGothel_015_f#Ugh, fine, we'll get right on that.
]
MotherGothel_020_fGHardly! I cared for those vegetables, nourished and raised them myself!
K
MotherGothel_021_f5Well dear, have you tried saying less foolish things?
6
MotherGothel_017_f I have evidence to the contrary.
;
MotherGothel_018_f%I was merely protecting what is mine.
