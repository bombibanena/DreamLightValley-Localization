Merlin_000_fHm? Oh, what are these?
H
Player_000_choice_000_f-Some strange flora from around Eternity Isle.
:
Player_000_choice_001_fI was hoping you could tell me.

Player_000_choice_002_fFlowers. Do you like them?
M
Merlin_002_f=Oh, well... how fascinating. These are quite peculiar indeed.
~
Merlin_011_fnIt's a good thing you brought them to me. We have to make sure Ursula doesn't get her hands on any of these...
l
Merlin_005_f\I'll need some time in the Library to research them... and some experiments may be required.
@
Merlin_006_f0I expect they'll keep me busy for quite a while.
G
Player_001_choice_000_f,It's so cute when you get into your hobbies!
U
Player_001_choice_001_f:Think you'll be able to make something useful out of them?
W
Merlin_007_fG"Cute"? "Hobbies"?! I'll have you know my research is serious business!
N
Merlin_008_f>Although, I do have quite a lot of fun doing it, I'll admit...
u
Merlin_012_feIn any case, I'd like to give you something to thank you for bringing me such an interesting project.
o
Merlin_013_f_I was doing some research with these earlier, but they're of no use to me now. Use them wisely!
k
Merlin_009_f[I suspect I can discover myriad uses. Possibly even something as useful as indoor plumbing.

Merlin_010_f#But more investigation is in order!
m
Merlin_003_f]Why, er, they seem to be a peculiar type of flora. I suspect they're native to Eternity Isle.
j
Merlin_004_fZLike them? Well, I'm certainly intrigued by them. They seem to grow only on Eternity Isle.
