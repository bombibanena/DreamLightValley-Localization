Gaston_000_fyAh, {PlayerName}. Has the heat of the Dunes overwhelmed you? Have you come to shelter in the shade of my enormous biceps?
U
Player_000_choice_000_f:Actually, I COULD use those biceps of yours for something!
$
Player_000_choice_002_f	Um... no.
i
Gaston_001_fYOh, do you need me to lift something? Or perhaps wrestle some sort of dangerous creature?
'
Gaston_003_fNot exactly, but close.
h
Gaston_005_fXI need you to pose on something and be as heavy as you possibly can to trip a trap door.
~
Gaston_004_fnHere. Check out this picture. You see, I'm trying to open this trap door in these Ancient Ruins so I canÃ¢Â€Â”
y
Gaston_006_fiStop! No need for more. You require someone to pose heroically, and I'm a hero who's excellent at posing!
`
Gaston_007_fPThere's only one problem. Without a proper breakfast, I won't be at my burliest.
F
Player_001_choice_000_f+Got it. One hero-sized breakfast coming up!
W
Player_001_choice_001_f<*sigh* Is this your way of getting me to make you breakfast?
H
Gaston_009_f8Ah, a very LeFou-like response, {PlayerName}. I approve.
k
Gaston_012_f[Of course, for a thoroughly filling breakfast, you must do more than bake a few croissants.

Gaston_013_f}I found an interesting recipe in the Dunes. It seems the ancient civilization that lived here had quite an impressive recipe.
I
Gaston_014_f9An <ActivityItem>omelet made of pure gold</ActivityItem>!
,
Player_002_choice_000_fSounds delicious.
/
Player_002_choice_001_fSounds hard to make.
@
Player_002_choice_002_f%Sounds like a recipe for indigestion.
<
Gaston_018_f,Yes, and I might even give you a small bite.
 
Gaston_021_fWow... thanks...
„
Gaston_016_ftThe recipe requires <ActivityItem>Golden Ingredients</ActivityItem>, but I haven't seen any of them around the Isle.
q
Gaston_024_faHmm... But since they WERE gold, perhaps the Mirage Wizard gathered them up in that vault of his?
6
Gaston_025_f&Right! I'll check the Cave of Wonders.
N
Gaston_019_f>Almost impossible! Lucky for me, you'll be handling that part.
N
Gaston_020_f>There's no gut like Gaston's. Mine will make quick work of it!

Gaston_022_fEww.
B
Gaston_010_f2Well, you ARE asking me to help you, {PlayerName}.
W
Gaston_011_fGHeroism is hard work. You can't expect me to do it on an empty stomach.
<
Gaston_002_f,... Oh. Well, what DOES bring you to see me?
