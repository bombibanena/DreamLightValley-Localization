Rapunzel_000_fWell, here we are. *sigh*
%
Rapunzel_001_fIs something wrong?
ƒ
Rapunzel_002_fqNo, no. It's just... sometimes the tower feels like my first friend here... and sometimes it feels like the past.
;
Player_000_choice_000_f Those are some complex feelings.

Player_000_choice_001_fThe tower is your friend...?

Player_000_choice_002_fThe past can't hurt you.
k
Rapunzel_003_fYI guess they are. But what I really want is for this place to look the way I remember it.
>
Rapunzel_004_f,I was thinking we could start with a ladder.
p
Rapunzel_005_f^How about a door? Then you can come and go without climbing. And friends can easily visit you.
_
Rapunzel_006_fMIt even looks like there's an old one hidden here. We just have to fix it up!

Rapunzel_007_f,Really?! Oh, I've always wanted my own door!

f
Rapunzel_008_fTI'm gonna have a door... with a knob, and hinges, and I can open it whenever I want!
À
Rapunzel_009_f­I just need to gather some materials to fix it. I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Zinc</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Tin</ActivityItem>, and some <ActivityItem>Soil</ActivityItem>.
?
Rapunzel_010_f-Those should be easy to find around the Isle.
{
Rapunzel_011_fiOnce you find it all, could you <Lore>bring everything to me</Lore>? I'd love to learn how to fix a door.
j
Rapunzel_012_fXI've done some woodworking on a few tiny chameleon houses, but never a human-sized door!

Rapunzel_013_f&You've got it! We can fix it together.
U
Rapunzel_014_fCThank you, {PlayerName}! ... Woo-hoo! I'm gonna have my own door!!!
™
Rapunzel_015_f†Oh, I have lots of dreams, but I guess you could say they all start with an open door. That was always the one thing that was missing.

Rapunzel_016_fNot for long!

Rapunzel_017_fHa-ha-ha! That was very funny.
P
Rapunzel_018_f>Well, I'm funny and handy too Ã¢Â€Â” one door coming right up!
q
Rapunzel_019_f_Yep. I used to talk to the walls as I painted them Ã¢Â€Â” they know all my thoughts and dreams.
D
Rapunzel_020_f2So, I'd really love to keep working on my designs.
g
Rapunzel_021_fUYou're right. Especially if we keep looking forward and focus on the amazing present!
