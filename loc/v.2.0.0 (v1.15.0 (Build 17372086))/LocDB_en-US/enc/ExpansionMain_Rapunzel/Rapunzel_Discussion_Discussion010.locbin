Rapunzel_000_f2Me? Well, I used to be afraid of lots of things...
X
Rapunzel_001_fFMostly because Mother was so worried I'd get hurt if I left the tower.
d
Rapunzel_002_fRBut I was probably most scared of quicksand... men with scary teeth... and rhinos.

Player_000_choice_002_fRhinos?
h
Rapunzel_003_fVYes! Mother said there's some on Eternity Isle, and it will swallow me up in a second.

Player_001_choice_000_f"I think Mother Gothel exaggerated.

Player_001_choice_002_fFear can be helpful.

Rapunzel_004_fRYou're probably right. The more time I spend outside, the more I'm realizing that.
<
Rapunzel_005_f*Now I know to look into things for myself.
Œ
Rapunzel_006_fzI am. Ever since the first time I left the tower I grew up in, I've been learning that what Mother said isn't always true.
[
Rapunzel_007_fIAnd I know that I'm stronger and braver than she ever thought I could be.
f
Rapunzel_008_fTI suppose that's true. It does keep us safe from things that are actually dangerous.
r
Rapunzel_009_f`But it can also keep us from chasing our dreams. I'm never going to let that happen to me again.
V
Rapunzel_010_fDYes... Mother said they'd bite me with sharp, gnashing teeth, but...
M
Rapunzel_011_f;I've met several men now and that definitely didn't happen.
”
Rapunzel_012_fYes. Mother said a rhino is a huge creature, as tall as the tower. With a metal horn like a sword, and heavy feet to trample you.
