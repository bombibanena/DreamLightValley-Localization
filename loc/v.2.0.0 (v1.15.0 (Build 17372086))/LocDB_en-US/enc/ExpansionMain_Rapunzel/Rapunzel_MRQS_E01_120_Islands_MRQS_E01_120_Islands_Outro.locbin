Rapunzel_016_fPI just found this diary entry that mentions Mother Gothel. I think she was here.
a
Rapunzel_003_fOShe must still be here! I just heard her laughing! Do you think she's close by?
`
Rapunzel_004_fNI can feel a LOT of magic in this place. I don't think that was Mother Gothel.
W
Rapunzel_032_fEMaybe some sort of... echo of her? Like she WAS here a long time ago.

I
Rapunzel_022_f7I don't know what I'll say to her when I see her again.
*
Rapunzel_023_fBecause she lied to you?

Rapunzel_024_fYes.
A
Rapunzel_033_f/You know it's okay to be upset with her, right?
i
Rapunzel_026_fWI know Ã¢Â€Â” I just Ã¢Â€Â” I want to focus on our missing things, if that's all right?
T
Rapunzel_001_fBOkay, but it seems like we should talk about it sooner or later...
Â
Rapunzel_006_f¯For now, let's review: We have a diary page that says Mother Gothel wanted the Jewel of Time, there was an echo of her voice, AND the Jewel of Time is missing from its statue.

Rapunzel_002_fYou don't think...
_
Rapunzel_008_fMHuh... Now that I think about it, she is very interested in magic and time...

Rapunzel_007_fMaybe, but... maybe not?
&
Rapunzel_009_fYou don't mean that!
r
Rapunzel_010_f`This place was our last chance to find the Jewel of Time. Without it, there will be big trouble.
B
Rapunzel_011_f0Well... There is one place you haven't looked...
O
Rapunzel_030_f=I'm not afraid. I've learned so much since I last saw Mother.
X
Rapunzel_031_fFThat's really kind of you, but I've learned that I can protect myself.
