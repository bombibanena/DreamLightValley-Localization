Rapunzel_000_f9Look! The tower walls are too mossy and crumbly to climb.
h
Rapunzel_010_fVWe'll have to find another way to save the Isle. Let's get away from this place, okay?

Player_000_choice_000_fWe're not giving up so easily.
:
Player_000_choice_001_fWhy are you suddenly so afraid?
1
Player_000_choice_002_fThere is no other way!
©
Rapunzel_012_f–All we need is a way to climb up there. A rope with a grappling hook or a ladder... You could hold it steady for me; you don't even have to go inside.
?
Rapunzel_014_f-No! You can't go up there alone. It's cursed!
2
Rapunzel_001_f The tower is cursed? Since when?
”
Rapunzel_015_fSince... I'm not sure... Sometimes I see a shadow of Mother in the window staring down at me... She always looks so disappointed.
>
Player_001_choice_000_f#I'm sure it's another magical echo.
<
Player_001_choice_001_f!We can get through this together.
F
Player_001_choice_002_f+Have you checked your stress levels lately?
T
Rapunzel_017_fBAn echo of what? What if it's something dark? Something dangerous?
z
Rapunzel_021_fhMaybe what you saw was a combination of the Jewel of Time's power and your feelings about Mother Gothel?
D
Rapunzel_003_f2I might need your help to stop it. Whatever it is.
C
Rapunzel_022_f1All right... Okay. Yes! If you need me, I'm here.
4
Rapunzel_023_f"Great! So, how do we get up there?
€
Rapunzel_024_fnHmm... Well, Mother once told me a story about a boy who grew a huge beanstalk to reach a giant in the clouds.
g
Rapunzel_025_fUBut because he disobeyed his Mother to buy the magic beans, the giant gobbled him up!
J
Player_002_choice_000_f/That's not how "Jack and the Beanstalk" goes...
3
Player_002_choice_001_fOh yeah... That story...
9
Player_002_choice_002_fYou're saying we need a giant?
R
Rapunzel_004_f@I'll get my friend Mickey to tell you the real version sometime.
@
Rapunzel_027_f.But I DO like the growing and climbing idea...
·
Rapunzel_008_f¤I've seen some pretty strong vines <Lore>growing on the Plains in the Glittering Dunes</Lore>. Maybe we could get some seeds and grow vines here to climb the tower?
R
Rapunzel_029_f@Oh, but the vines won't be tall enough for a really long time...
›
Rapunzel_028_fˆI've got an idea. We have my Hourglass. If I <Lore>find a few Vine Seeds in the Oasis</Lore>, I can plant them here and speed things up.
H
Rapunzel_009_f6We'll be climbing the tower in no time! ... Literally.
m
Rapunzel_020_f[... Okay... If you're sure... Maybe you can find some <Lore>Vine Seeds</Lore> in the Oasis.
L
Rapunzel_030_f:I'll stay here and watch the tower window... just in case.
5
Rapunzel_026_f#I remember it a little differently.
9
Rapunzel_005_f'No, I was thinking we need a beanstalk!
]
Rapunzel_006_fKUnless you know an actual giant. One who's friendly and won't gobble us up.
S
Rapunzel_007_fAI have a lot of interesting friends in the Valley, but no giants.
—
Rapunzel_016_f„I won't let this curse Ã¢Â€Â” our whatever it is Ã¢Â€Â” hurt you, Rapunzel, but I can't let it stop me. Eternity Isle depends on it.
;
Rapunzel_018_f)Stress can make you see lots of things...
P
Rapunzel_019_f>It's not my imagination. I REALLY have seen her in the window.
‚
Rapunzel_011_fp*sigh* I should have told you the first time we heard the echo of Mother's voice... I think the tower is cursed.
V
Rapunzel_013_fDBut what if we just have to look harder? Starting anywhere but here?
@
Rapunzel_002_f.Why are you trying to back out of this now...?
