d
Rapunzel_006_fRI've been learning that. I'm so happy we found each other in the jungle... friend.
k
Rapunzel_015_fYDon't worry, Rapunzel. I'll <Lore>search Eternity Isle for your missing treasures</Lore>.
}
Rapunzel_016_fkThank you! And while you do that, I'm going to sweep the tower. Who knew it was so hard to get rid of sand?

Rapunzel_007_f*And, well... I did have something in mind.
y
Rapunzel_008_fgWhen Mother was upset with me, she'd take something of mine away. I'd really like to find my treasures.
…
Rapunzel_009_fsShe said she "lost" them around the Isle. But with time all confused, I don't know where or WHEN they might be now.
Z
Rapunzel_010_fHI bet I can find them with my Hourglass. What should I be searching for?
¯
Rapunzel_011_fœMy <ActivityItem>Frying Pan</ActivityItem>. It's cast iron, and I think she took it to the Oasis. She said practicing self-defense with it was "unladylike."
Ž
Rapunzel_012_f|My <ActivityItem>Wall Clock</ActivityItem> might be at the Docks. She said I didn't need to worry about the passing of time.
·
Rapunzel_013_f¤My <ActivityItem>Handheld Lantern</ActivityItem> is probably in the Grasslands. That was because I was up too late reading and getting silly ideas about adventures.
‡
Rapunzel_014_fuAnd my <ActivityItem>Purple Pillow</ActivityItem> should be by the Promenade. I think she just wanted it for herself.
