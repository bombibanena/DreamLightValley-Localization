Rapunzel_000_fn*gasp* What did you pick up off the ground? It looks like a <ActivityItem>piece of a sphere</ActivityItem>...?
c
Rapunzel_002_fQAnd it's made of the same golden material as <Lore>that sun in the door</Lore>...
¼
Rapunzel_001_f©Right! I think it's supposed to be the <Lore>core of the sun</Lore>. But it's missing pieces... I bet if we found them and put them together, the door would open for us.

Rapunzel_017_f«I promise. I've looked through this ENTIRE jungle. Painting is very important to me. It helped me pass the time in the tower. It's like it... made my world more beautiful.

Rapunzel_018_fiI used to see lights on the mainland from my window every night. So I painted them in a mural on my wall.

Rapunzel_019_f4Those lights had to be from the villagers' houses...

Rapunzel_020_fqBut then Mother got angry. She said I was ungrateful for what I had, took my paints away, and hid them somewhere.

Rapunzel_039_fShe just doesn't understand.
h
Rapunzel_040_fVDon't worry about it too much, okay? Let's just focus on getting this door open first.
z
Rapunzel_036_fhMother is VERY determined. If she wants something, or wants to hide something, she'll always find a way.
A
Rapunzel_038_f/We're determined too. Let's get this door open!
