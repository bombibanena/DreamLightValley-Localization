Rapunzel_002_f4It's... Well, the dÃƒÂ©cor is interesting, isn't it?

Player_000_choice_000_fI call it "Retro Rugged."

Player_000_choice_001_f$Don't look at me. That's all Gaston.

Rapunzel_004_f#You don't think it's a little much?
š
Rapunzel_005_f‡It seems to suit him. And I can't really judge. You might think the decorations were odd in the place where I was hiding in the jungle.

Rapunzel_006_f3I can't even imagine what Mother would have said...

Rapunzel_008_f3Though I did meet Gaston once when I was exploring.

Rapunzel_009_f+I'm so glad he's come out of his shell now.

Rapunzel_010_f+Really? He was more restrained in the past?

Rapunzel_011_fQWell, he just seemed... lonely. He was building himself a friend out of coconuts.
`
Rapunzel_012_fNWhen he saw me, he tried to pretend it wasn't there... It was kind of awkward.
¡
Rapunzel_000_fŽOh, that tracks. He was a little sensitive about being so lonely. I think he just needed a friend... even if it was a friend made of coconuts.

Rapunzel_013_f5I'll let you get back to the gathering now. Have fun!
