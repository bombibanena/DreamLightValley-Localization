Anna_000_fOkay... I'm a bit confused.
c

Anna_001_fU{PlayerName}, why are you giving me <ActivityItem>Broken Table Pieces</ActivityItem>?
P

Anna_002_fBOh, wait! Is that the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>?
=
Player_000_f-Yes! But it's broken, and I want to fix it...
4
Player_000_choice_000_f...to make Mirabel happy.
D
Player_000_choice_001_f)...to honor your friendship with Mirabel.
3
Player_000_choice_002_f...to throw a fun party.
e

Anna_003_fWThat's such a great idea! Mirabel is so nice. You're right; we need to do that for her.
ä

Anna_004_f|Oh, I know! I'll ask Kristoff and Elsa to help us fix the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem> as a gift for Mirabel.
K

Anna_005_f=Kristoff can help repair it, and we can make some new chairs.
E

Anna_006_f7And maybe Elsa can use her powers to decorate the wood.
V

Anna_007_fHIt'll be fun! And then we can throw a party to celebrate our friendship!
V

Anna_008_fHOh! But what about Moana? She always used to help us with these parties.
U

Anna_009_fGI talked to her. She's making a brand-new tablecloth using an old sail.
ª

Anna_010_f¨And I'll take care of the food. I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Bu√É¬±uelos</ActivityItem> to celebrate Mirabel and a <ActivityItem>Large Seafood Plate</ActivityItem> for Moana.
9

Anna_011_f+Is there anything you and Elsa like to eat?
}

Anna_012_foChocolate! Definitely chocolate. Maybe you could make some <ActivityItem>Chocolate Chip Cookies</ActivityItem>.
¥

Anna_013_f•Remy introduced us to them, and they're amazing! He gave me a <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem> in case I wanted to make them myself. Here, you can borrow it.
{

Anna_014_fmNow, I'll go work on the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>. It'll probably take us a day to fix it.
.

Anna_015_f I'll talk to Moana. Don't worry.
ü

Anna_016_fêAnd I'll take care of the food. I'm thinking <ActivityItem>Bu√É¬±uelos</ActivityItem> to celebrate Mirabel. Is there any food you'd like to eat?
<

Anna_017_f.Oh, that's so nice of you! And I have to help.
ñ

Anna_018_fáWell, you came to the right place. Mirabel, Moana, Elsa and I used to have so much fun together. I'd love for it to be like that again.
