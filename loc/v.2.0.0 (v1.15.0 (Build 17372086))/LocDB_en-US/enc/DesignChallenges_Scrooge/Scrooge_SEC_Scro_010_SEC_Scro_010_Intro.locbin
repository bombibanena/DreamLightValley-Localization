Player_000_choice_001_fYou're scaring me!

Scrooge_003_ffAye, it's possible! My ancestral home, Castle McDuck, had ghosts and apparitions clear to the rafters!

Scrooge_004_fdBut this specter looked different than any ghost I've seen before. It flickered in and out of sight.

Scrooge_005_fÑSince you're an adventurer like me, I want your second opinion. Could ya <Lore>go to the Dream Castle and look for the ghost?</Lore>

Scrooge_006_fNI last saw it <Lore>at the very top of the stairs next to the fountain!</Lore>

Scrooge_007_fÄOch. There's no need to be frightened of ghosts. Why, back in Scotland, Castle McDuck is rife with my formerly living relatives.

Scrooge_008_f|Dinnae be so skeptical! Back in Scotland, Castle McDuck's filled with spirits aplenty! Mostly my relatives who've passed on.
