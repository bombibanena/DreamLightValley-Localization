Mirabel_000_fiHola, Mirabel! Do you have any ideas for how to glue together Vanellope's race kart? It's made of pastry!

Mirabel_001_fˆThat's amazing! But I'm sorry... my mamÃƒÂ¡ does most of the baking at home. BuÃƒÂ±uelos... arepas... nothing you need to glue together.

Mirabel_002_f+You should talk to someone who bakes a lot!
