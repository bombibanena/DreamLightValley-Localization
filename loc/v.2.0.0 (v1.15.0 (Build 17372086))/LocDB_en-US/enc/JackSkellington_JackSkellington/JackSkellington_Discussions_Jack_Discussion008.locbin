 
JackSkellington_003_f†"IÃ‚Â couldÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â taleÃ‚Â unfoldÃ‚Â whoseÃ‚Â lightestÃ‚Â word
WouldÃ‚Â harrowÃ‚Â upÃ‚Â thyÃ‚Â soul,
FreezeÃ‚Â thyÃ‚Â youngÃ‚Â blood,
›
JackSkellington_004_fMakeÃ‚Â thyÃ‚Â twoÃ‚Â eyes,Ã‚Â likeÃ‚Â stars,Ã‚Â startÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â their spheres
ThyÃ‚Â knottedÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â combinedÃ‚Â locksÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â part,
AndÃ‚Â eachÃ‚Â particularÃ‚Â hairÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â standÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â end,
LikeÃ‚Â quillsÃ‚Â uponÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â fearfulÃ‚Â porpentine!"

’
JackSkellington_006_fy"Double, double toil and trouble,
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake.
š
JackSkellington_007_f€Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing!"

Player_002_choice_000_fOK, that's enough for me.
 
Player_002_choice_001_fMore!

JackSkellington_008_f1"Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
J
JackSkellington_009_f1The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
L
JackSkellington_010_f3And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves!"

I knew him, {PlayerName}: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
‘
JackSkellington_014_fxWhere be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar?"
$
