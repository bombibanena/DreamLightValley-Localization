JackSkellington_000_fnFriend, I'm sure you've heard that I once tried my hand at running Christmas. Alas, it was quite the disaster.
h
JackSkellington_001_fOI made so many mistakes, but I'm wondering if there was one fundamental flaw...
I
JackSkellington_002_f0A central confusion. A core to all the calamity.
H
Player_000_choice_000_f-Maybe you didn't really understand Christmas.
K
Player_000_choice_001_f0Maybe you let your excitement run away from you.

Player_000_choice_002_fI don't know enough to say.
V
JackSkellington_003_f=I think you're right. But oh how I wanted to! Oh how I tried!
[
JackSkellington_004_fBMy longing was so intense that I convinced myself I understood it.
L
JackSkellington_005_f3Yes. I believe that was the root of my foolishness.
H
JackSkellington_006_f/Does that mean that you've learned your lesson?
d
JackSkellington_007_fKOf course. Hmm... but say I hadn't learned my lesson. Would that SCARE you?

Player_001_choice_000_fYes!

Player_001_choice_001_fNo.
8
Player_001_choice_002_fI'm not going to answer that.
U
JackSkellington_008_f<Well, then perhaps... I've learned nothing at all! Ha-ha-ha!
r
JackSkellington_009_fYI see... I'll have to take that into consideration when designing future frights for you.
$
JackSkellington_010_fHow clever!
G
JackSkellington_011_f.I certainly did. Enthusiasm is quite powerful.
Z
JackSkellington_012_fAAnd usually it's good! It animates my frights! Keeps me inspired.
H
JackSkellington_013_f/But it can sometimes... have a life of its own.
:
JackSkellington_014_f!Such modesty will serve you well.
P
JackSkellington_015_f7It'll keep you from thinking you know more than you do.
T
JackSkellington_016_f;And from doing more than you ought. I could learn from you!
