JackSkellington_003_f_I've made a fantastic discovery! Why, this almost rivals when I first paired orange with black!

JackSkellington_004_f@There's something missing from the heart of Dreamlight Valley...

JackSkellington_006_f
A holiday!
x
JackSkellington_007_f_Consider this... There's a clear connection between the Holiday forest and Dreamlight Valley...
T
JackSkellington_008_f;But there's no holiday! It's what's been missing all along.
:
Player_001_choice_000_fHmm, that actually makes sense.
6
Player_001_choice_001_fI'm not so sure about that.
N
Player_001_choice_002_f3Do you have a corkboard full of notes and red yarn?

Excellent!
D
JackSkellington_019_f+Let's get it going Ã¢Â€Â” what do you need?

JackSkellington_020_fvI need you to poll some of the Villagers. Ask them about their favorite holidays and what those holidays mean to them.
ˆ
JackSkellington_021_foThere are so many different people here that it stands to reason Dreamlight Day will be the sum of those parts.
è
JackSkellington_022_fÎI suggest you talk to <ActivityItem>Vanellope</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Scar</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Olaf</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Minnie</ActivityItem> for a cross-representative sample.

JackSkellington_023_fSure, on my way.
T
JackSkellington_015_f;Oh {PlayerName}, that was a completely different situation.
Z
JackSkellington_016_fAI've learned my lesson about taking over other people's holidays.
L
JackSkellington_017_f3This is more like... growing a new one from a seed.
N
JackSkellington_018_f5All right... I guess it can't hurt. What do you need?
F
JackSkellington_010_f-Let me explain. I'm sure you'll be convinced.
M
JackSkellington_011_f4I don't follow. But I do use a chalk and blackboard.
