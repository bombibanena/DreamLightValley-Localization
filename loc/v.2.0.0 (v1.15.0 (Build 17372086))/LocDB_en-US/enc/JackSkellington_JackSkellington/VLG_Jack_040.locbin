HVillage!Nightmare!JackSkellington!VLG_Jack_040_CompletedStoryDescription¾With a final fright for Jack Skellington, Dreamlight Day pulls to a close, with the caveat that this will not be repeated in a year's time. Still, Jack Skellington feels extra welcomed to the Valley now that you and Minnie managed to give him a fright, and he's content to leave off scaring other Villagers... for now.
