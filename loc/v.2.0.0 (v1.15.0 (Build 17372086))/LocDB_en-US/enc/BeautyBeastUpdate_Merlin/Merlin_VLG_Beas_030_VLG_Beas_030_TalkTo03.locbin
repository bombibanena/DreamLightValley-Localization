Merlin_000_f2Ah, what brings you to see me today, {PlayerName}?
:
Merlin_001_f*It's, uhh, a bit of a sensitive situation.
E
Merlin_002_f5I could use some magical advice if you have a moment.
8
Merlin_003_f(Of course! What seems to be the trouble?
‘
Merlin_004_f€I'm trying to help the Beast with some self-improvement. He's got some... let's say, anger issues that he's trying to move past.
X
Merlin_005_fHI see... Well, has he tried being a squirrel or a fish for an afternoon?
Y
Merlin_006_fIIn my experience, spending time in animal form can be quite illuminating!
I
Player_000_choice_000_f.I don't think the Beast would appreciate that.
&
Player_000_choice_001_fTempting...
+
Merlin_007_fHmmm, yes, I suppose not...
c
Merlin_008_fSThe Beast knows that he has a good heart. He just needs some help connecting to it.
 
Merlin_009_fAh! Say no more.
‚
Merlin_010_frThere's an enchanted item that might be of use here Ã¢Â€Â” the <ActivityItem>Mirror of True Seeing</ActivityItem>.

Merlin_011_fGo on...
|
Merlin_012_flWhen one looks into the Mirror, it shows one's true self without any perceived illusions or self-deceptions.
0
Merlin_013_f So if the Beast looks into it...
m
Merlin_014_f]He will see his real inner strength, his compassion. Everything he doubts yet carries within.
*
Merlin_015_fPerfect! How do I make it?
Î
Merlin_016_f½You'll need a <ActivityItem>Gold Ingot</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>.
?
Merlin_017_f/I'll get started on that Ã¢Â€Â” thanks, Merlin!
4
Merlin_018_f$So if Mother Gothel looks into it...
C
Merlin_019_f3She shall see the part of her that acts so cruelly.
I
Merlin_020_f9But I think we're looking for more of an internal change.
j
Merlin_021_fZWell, we've been having some issues with Mother Gothel's treatment of the other Villagers.
O
Merlin_022_f?She was extremely rude to Belle and quite infuriated the Beast.
M
Merlin_023_f=Ahh, you wish to turn her into a frog for a bit? Say no more.
L
Merlin_024_f<That's a nice offer, but not exactly what I'm looking for...
4
Merlin_025_f$Perhaps a squirrel? Or maybe a fish?
+
Player_001_choice_000_fVery tempting...
W
Player_001_choice_001_f<Nah, I think we'll stay away from transformations for now...
U
Merlin_026_fESpending time as an animal always teaches a lesson, in my experience.
a
Merlin_027_fQWe need something that will show Mother Gothel exactly the kind of person she is.
›
Merlin_028_fŠShe's always so self-assured and arrogant! If she saw herself the way so many others see her, I don't think she'd be so quick to lash out.

Merlin_029_fA pity!
