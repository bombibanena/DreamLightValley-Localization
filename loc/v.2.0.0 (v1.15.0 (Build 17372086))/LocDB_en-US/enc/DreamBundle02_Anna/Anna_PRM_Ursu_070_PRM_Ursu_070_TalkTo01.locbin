Anna_004_f2Who knew that too much chocolate could be a thing?

Anna_005_fgHmm... Anna, usually Ursula doesn't give out anything for free. She expects something else in exchange.

Anna_006_f‘Oh, I know. She asked for some <ActivityItem>Ice Shards</ActivityItem> made by Elsa's magic. I mean, it's just ice right? What could be the harm?

Anna_007_fëAnd Elsa left some ice blocks around the Village, so I was going to ask Kristoff to help me break them into shards. But he's kind of busy, and my stomach is all... BLECH! Any chance you could break them and bring them to Ursula for me?
