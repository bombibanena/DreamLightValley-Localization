Anna_000_fXSee what I mean? That Earth Giant fell asleep over there and now it's blocking the path.
`

Anna_001_fRWe'll have to wake it up. But we've gotta be careful. They can be a bit... grumpy.
Y

Anna_002_fKWhich I totally get. Just ask my sister. I am not much of a morning person.
E
Player_000_choice_000_f*Not me. I'm always ready to seize the day.
C
Player_000_choice_002_f(*yawn* I could go back to bed right now.
g

Anna_003_fYYou sound like Elsa. I'm actually a little jealous. I could totally take a nap right now.
<

Anna_005_f.But I won't! Because we have a forest to save.
k

Anna_007_f]So we've got one missing sister and one slumbering Earth Giant. How do we wake this thing up?
F

Anna_008_f8Well, there's one thing that always wakes me right up...
 

Anna_009_fThe smell of food!
<
Player_001_choice_000_f!One gigantic breakfast coming up!
4
Player_001_choice_001_fDo Earth Giants even eat?
à

Anna_010_fzOh! We could make it something Elsa and I used to make when we were little √¢¬Ä¬î <ActivityItem>Stone Soup</ActivityItem>!
Ä

Anna_012_frOn sunny days, the gardener would give us the Ingredients, and we'd pretend we were cooking for the whole kingdom.
ﬂ

Anna_011_f–We'll need some <ActivityItem>Craggy Rocks</ActivityItem> and a broth of <ActivityItem>Oregano</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Basil</ActivityItem>. The smell of that should wake our giant friend in no time.
Å

Anna_016_fsI'm sure if we <Lore>look around here</Lore>, we can find just the right <ActivityItem>Craggy Rocks</ActivityItem>.
h

Anna_013_fZBut we might have to <Lore>look somewhere else</Lore> to find the rest of the Ingredients.
∏

Anna_017_f©Once we have the Ingredients, let's <Lore>cook the <ActivityItem>Stone Soup</ActivityItem></Lore> and <Lore>put it on the pile of rocks by the Earth Giant's foot.</Lore>
ã

Anna_015_f}I have no idea. But if we make something with a strong enough smell to get its attention, maybe it won't matter. Let's see...
-

Anna_004_fOoo! Don't take a nap just yet.
