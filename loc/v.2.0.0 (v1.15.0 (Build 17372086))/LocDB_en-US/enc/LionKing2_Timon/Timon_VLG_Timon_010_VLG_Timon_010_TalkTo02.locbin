Timon_000_fJHey Timon, how are you doing? Do you feel any better about the Valley now?
ˆ
Timon_001_fyI most certainly do! I thought about what you said, started mingling with the locals, and met somebody who really helped.
B
Timon_002_f3I had a lot of help when I first arrived here, too.

Timon_007_fSo who did you end up meeting?

Timon_008_f
Vanellope!
`
Timon_009_fQShe had some Ã¢Â€Â” let's say Ã¢Â€Â” inventive ideas to help take care of things.
Q
Timon_010_fBWait, what do you mean by that? What did you need to take care of?
q
Timon_011_fbOh, it's just a piffling little Ã¢Â€Â” ya know what? Never mind. Nothin' to concern yourself with.

Player_002_choice_002_fThis sounds like trouble...
5
Timon_012_f&Me? Whoa, now! *I* didn't do anything!
n
Timon_015_f_I just pointed out Scar's generally terrifying personality, and Vanellope came up with an idea.
,
Timon_017_fOh no... what did you two do?
j
Timon_018_f[SHE thought maybe we needed a little anti-lion security around here. And I happen to agree.
-
Timon_019_fBut what about Simba and Nala?
~
Timon_020_foOh, it's not for them! She said she'd do somethin' in Scar's Cave to keep the rest of the Valley safe from HIM.
¥
Timon_021_f•Oof, okay, I need to go <Lore>investigate Scar's Cave</Lore> before something bad happens. You should go find Pumbaa and try not to get into trouble!
&
Timon_013_fNothing bad! I promise!

Timon_014_fHA! Trouble for Scar, maybe!
