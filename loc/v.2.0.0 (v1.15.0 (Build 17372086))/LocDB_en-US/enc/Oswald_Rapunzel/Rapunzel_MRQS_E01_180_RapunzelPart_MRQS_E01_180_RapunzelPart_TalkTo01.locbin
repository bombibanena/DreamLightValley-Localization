Rapunzel_000_f Ahhh... ahhh... AHHHH... ahhh...

Rapunzel_001_fCHOOOOOO!!!
&
Player_000_choice_000_fGesundheit?
*
Player_000_choice_001_fUh... you okay?
8
Player_000_choice_002_fMaybe I'll come back later...
ù
Rapunzel_002_fäUgh. I'm sorry, {PlayerName}. I got really close to one of those big flytrap plants and it let out a big cloud of pollen right in my face.
T
Rapunzel_011_fBBut I really want to help you after all the ways you've helped me!
d
Rapunzel_012_fRA-A-ACHOO! *sigh* If only I had the tea or the soup that Mother used to make me...
x
Rapunzel_013_ffYou see, whenever I had a sore throat, she'd make them, and after just a few sips, I could sing again.
.
Rapunzel_014_fMaybe I could make you some?
ê
Rapunzel_015_f~*sniffles* Do you think you could do it? I'd make them myself, but Mother had special recipes that she wouldn't share with me.
N
Rapunzel_005_f<I've been sneezing ever since and my throat is all scratchy.
h
Rapunzel_007_fVI'm sure I'll be fine soon. Did you need something? Is there anything I can help with?
\
Rapunzel_008_fJI'm on the trail of this special treasure called the Spark of Imagination.
^
Rapunzel_009_fLBut to find it, I need to solve this special puzzle involving musical notes.
i
Rapunzel_003_fWIt seems like we'll need to know the right notes, and we'll need somebody to sing them.
Z
Rapunzel_004_fHOh no. If that's why you're here, I don't think I can help anytime soon.
[
Rapunzel_006_fIWith my throat this scratchy, I haven't been able to sing a note all day.
P
Rapunzel_010_f>Oh... I guess I could ask someone else to help with that part.
ò
Rapunzel_016_fÖI really don't want to ask Mother for help. Not after I've come such a long way. I just know she'll ask me to sing for her in return.
R
Rapunzel_018_f@Your Mother left some stuff in your tower. Could it be up there?
_
Rapunzel_019_fMYou know, you might be right. ACHOO! Ugh... She left a bunch of things there.
d
Rapunzel_020_fRBut I haven't looked through any of it yet. I've been too busy exploring the Isle.
]
Rapunzel_021_fKNo problem. I'll go <Lore>search your Tower</Lore> and see what I can find.
_
Rapunzel_017_fMAnd since no one's seen Mother in quite a while... the recipes might be lost.
