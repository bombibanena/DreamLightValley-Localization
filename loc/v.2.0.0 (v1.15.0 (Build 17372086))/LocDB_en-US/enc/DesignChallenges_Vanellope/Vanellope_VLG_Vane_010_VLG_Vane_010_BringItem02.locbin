Vanellope_003_fžI bet WALLÃ‚Â·E has a power source and electronic junk we can use. Just swing by his place and grab it. And don't worry; he lets me borrow stuff all the time.

Vanellope_004_f€We'll also need something to act like glue to hold it together. Maybe <Lore>ask a Villager who knows lots about pastries.</Lore>

Vanellope_005_f‡Then, when you've got <Lore>a power source, electronic parts, and something to glue the kart parts together</Lore>, bring it all to me!
