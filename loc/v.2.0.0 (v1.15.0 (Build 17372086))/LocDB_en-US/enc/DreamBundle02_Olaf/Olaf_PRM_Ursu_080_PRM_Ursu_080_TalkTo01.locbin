Olaf_000_f)Oh, {PlayerName}! I'm SO glad to see you.
5

Olaf_001_f'I know you can help me with my problem.
h

Olaf_002_fZUrsula gave me an adorable <ActivityItem>Stuffed Animal</ActivityItem>. Ooo, it's so cute!
/

Olaf_003_f!What did she ask for in exchange?
Q

Olaf_004_fCExchange? Nothing. She just gave it to me! It was very nice of her.
@

Olaf_005_f2But it looked a little dirty. So I gave it a bath.
g

Olaf_006_fYEver since then, it's been spewing strange black smoke. {PlayerName}, I think I broke it!
„
Player_000_ftI'm sorry to have to break it to you. But I think Ursula tried to use her magic on you for some nefarious purpose...
/
Player_000_choice_000_fPlease don't be sad.
R
Player_000_choice_001_f7You're sure you didn't make a deal with her and forget?
3
Player_000_choice_002_fLet's plot your revenge.
E

Olaf_007_f7Oh... I think I am a little sad. But mostly for Ursula.
d

Olaf_008_fVShe doesn't have to try to trick everyone. Maybe she doesn't know how to make friends.
™

Olaf_009_fŠ*gasp* I know! We can bring her a friend! Let's give her the <ActivityItem>Stuffed Animal</ActivityItem> back! After we fix it, of course.
_

Olaf_010_fQHmm... I also want her to know that I'm not mad and that I'll be her friend, too.
[

Olaf_011_fMAnd nothing says that like a <ActivityItem>Bouquet of Flowers</ActivityItem>!
A

Olaf_012_f3Could you help me do that, {PlayerName}? Could you?
$
Player_001_fSure, I'll help you.
F
Player_001_choice_000_f+Let's show Ursula what it means to be nice.
4
Player_001_choice_001_fBecause you're my friend.
S
Player_001_choice_002_f8You're too nice. You sure you don't want to get revenge?
C

Olaf_013_f5Oh, thank you, {PlayerName}! I knew you'd understand.
!

Olaf_014_fAlways and forever.
•

Olaf_015_f†Positive. And is there really such a thing as "too nice"? I may not be very old, but I have yet to meet anyone with too much niceness.
K

Olaf_016_f=No. I would definitely remember something as fun as a "deal."
i

Olaf_017_f[Hey... do you think that making deals and playing tricks is Ursula's way of making friends?
„

Olaf_018_fvOh, I don't want to do anything like that. We should show her that she doesn't have to trick everyone to make friends.
