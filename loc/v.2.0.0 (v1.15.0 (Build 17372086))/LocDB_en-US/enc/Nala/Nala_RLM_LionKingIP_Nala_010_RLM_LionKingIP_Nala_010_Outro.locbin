Nala_000_f:Wow, you weren't kidding about this place. It's beautiful.

Nala_006_f*It already feels like I have friends here.

Nala_010_f#I hope Simba comes to join us soon.
G

Nala_011_f9I'll go talk to him. For now, you just enjoy the Village.

Player_000_choice_000_fYou could explore the Valley.
;
Player_000_choice_001_f You could find something to eat.
G
Player_000_choice_002_f,You could start meeting the other Villagers.
!

Nala_007_fSay, where's Simba?
H

Nala_008_f:He said he'd come meet us soon. He wanted some time alone.
f

Nala_009_fXThe fight with the hyenas... I think it brought back some old memories about his father.
)

Nala_001_fSpeaking of old memories...
,

Nala_002_fI think I've been here before.
F

Nala_003_f8You used to live here, Nala. Back before the Forgetting.
a

Nala_004_fSIt might take a while for all your memories to come back. Just try to take it slow.
H

Nala_005_f:This is amazing! I can't believe I ever forgot this place.
P

Nala_014_fBThere's so much to see. I'll do some scouting and see what I find.
>

Nala_020_f0There's just one thing I have to warn you about.
!

Nala_021_fWatch out for Scar.
>

Nala_022_f0Scar is here? That'sÃ¢Â€Â” How is that possible?
O

Nala_023_fAI watched him fall from Pride Rock and... he can't have survived.
/
Player_001_choice_000_fHe's pretty cunning.
E
Player_001_choice_002_f*Anything is possible in Dreamlight Valley.
H
Player_001_choice_003_f-Scar's not so bad. I've got him well-trained.
N

Nala_026_f@Who knows how he survived. But I wouldn't put anything past him.
#

Nala_024_fI guess you're right.
j

Nala_025_f\Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on Scar. He better not try anything, or I'll put a stop to it.
z

Nala_027_flThe rules here... they're pretty different from anywhere else. Maybe this isn't quite the Scar you remember.
R

Nala_028_fDOh... I guess there's a lot I don't understand about this place yet.
S

Nala_029_fEI've practically turned him into a housecat. You don't need to worry.
W

Nala_030_fII hope you're right. But I'm going to keep an eye on him... just in case.
^

Nala_012_fPThat's a great idea. I bet some of these rivers and ponds have fish I could eat.
.

Nala_015_f That would certainly beat grubs.
#

Nala_017_fI'd really like that.

Nala_018_f$One can never have too many friends.
