Nala_030_fIIt's done! I've got the perfect territory set up for you on Dazzle Beach.
€

Nala_031_frThank you! I really appreciate it. And now I can teach you to pounce, just like Simba and I learned to do as cubs.
T

Nala_009_fFBut before we start... you're not really dressed for pouncing lessons.
d

Nala_019_fVYou need to be protected from the heat of the sun and ready to hide in the underbrush.
u

Nala_020_fgSince you don't have fur like I do, maybe you could find some of those coverings you wear on your body.
G

Nala_021_f9Great. I'll <Lore>put on some more Rustic clothes.</Lore>
B

Nala_022_f4Oh, and whiskers! You'll need some sort of whiskers.

Player_002_choice_002_f(We humans call our whiskers "mustaches."
k

Nala_023_f]But you must have something like them. How else do you navigate and detect what's around you?
N

Nala_024_f@Okay. I'll make sure I'm <Lore>wearing whiskers</Lore> for this.
Z

Nala_025_fLLet's meet on Dazzle Beach when you're ready for your first pouncing lesson.
u

Nala_026_fgI use mine to help me navigate and detect what's around me. So you'll have to find something like that.
U

Nala_027_fGAnd you use these "mustaches" to navigate and detect what's around you?

Nala_028_f

Nala_029_fGood.
