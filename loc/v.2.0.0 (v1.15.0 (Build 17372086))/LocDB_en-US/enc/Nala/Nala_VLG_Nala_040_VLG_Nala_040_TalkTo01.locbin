Nala_006_fKYou put the <ActivityItem>Lioness Statues</ActivityItem> down by the rifts?
2
Player_000_choice_000_fI just hope this works.
7
Player_000_choice_001_fHave you noticed any change?
B
Player_000_choice_002_f'Another problem solved by {PlayerName}!


Nala_008_fMe too.


Nala_011_fWait...
^

Nala_012_fPMy whiskers are twitching again. Just like they did when the rifts first opened.


Nala_013_fDo you feel that?
/
Player_001_choice_000_fI feel... something.
8
Player_001_choice_001_fFeel what?! What's happening?
B
Player_001_choice_002_f'Uh, I think this might be a lion thing.
B

Nala_014_f4It's so strong. I can feel it tingling in my paws...
/

Nala_023_f!And they smell kind of delicious.
(
Player_002_fYou want to eat them...?
3
Player_002_choice_000_fMe too. They look tasty.
=
Player_002_choice_001_f"I'll admit, I am a little curious.
J
Player_002_choice_002_f/Ew. Nala! No eating interdimensional nastiness.

Nala_007_f#I... I think the rifts are closing!
A

Nala_017_f3Did you see those flashes of light in the distance?
+

Nala_018_fAnd that awful smell is gone.
^

Nala_019_fPI think it's really over, {PlayerName}. We sealed the rifts, for good this time.
3

Nala_020_f%Oh, hold on... There's a new smell...
D

Nala_021_f6Those fish that swam through the rifts are still here.
Z

Nala_022_fLBut they're different somehow. They smell like... regular fish... real fish.
3

Nala_026_f%Maybe we're just hungry. But I agree.
4

Nala_029_f&I guess we won't know until we try it.
~

Nala_025_fpI'll <Lore>catch some of the fish and bring them to Remy</Lore> to see if they can be made into anything edible.
Œ

Nala_000_f~Though, I bet those fish don't like warm water very much. I'll probably need to wait until it's a little cooler to catch them.
o

Nala_001_faMaybe if I try fishing in the morning or in the evening, when the sun's not as high in the sky...
O

Nala_024_fAThey didn't look very tasty. But lots of delicious stuff doesn't.
0

Nala_030_f"Like those grubs Simba had me eat.
7

Nala_027_f)That stuff could make you sick. Or worse.
i

Nala_031_f[Maybe you'd get indigestion. Or maybe you'd start popping in and out of the Here and There.
_

Nala_032_fQThey don't smell dangerous anymore. Like I said, they smell just like other fish.
S

Nala_015_fEIt's not just my whiskers. I can feel this... tingling... in my paws.
U

Nala_016_fGIt can't be. It's so strong. Can't you feel that tingling in your feet?


Nala_009_fNot yet.
`

Nala_010_fRI don't know if it's solved just yet. We should wait and see if the rifts close...
