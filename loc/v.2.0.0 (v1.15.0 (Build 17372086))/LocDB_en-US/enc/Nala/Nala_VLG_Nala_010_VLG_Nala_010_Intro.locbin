Nala_006_fe{PlayerName}, I've been scouting the Valley, and it seems to have many of the things we have at home.
@

Nala_012_f2Lots of water holes, gathering spots, and caves...
?

Nala_013_f1...and a few things I don't understand very well.
|

Nala_007_fnBut there's one thing missing that would make it better for lions. Do you think you could help me change that?
P
Player_000_choice_000_f5Yes! Let's make Dreamlight Valley more lion friendly.
>
Player_000_choice_001_f#Sorry, I can't. I'm busy right now.
r

Nala_008_fdThank you! So, in the Pride Lands, I'm in charge of finding food and keeping the pride safe and fed.

Nala_009_f'I'd like to do that for this place too.
4

Nala_011_f&But there isn't a good hunting ground.
B
Player_001_choice_000_f'I'll make one so you feel more at home.
F
Player_001_choice_001_f+A hunting ground? What do we need for that?
E
Player_001_choice_002_f*But there's nothing around here to hunt...
B

Nala_010_f4That would be great! This is going to help everyone.
b

Nala_000_fTWe'll need to find a stretch of flat land, somewhere without much to get in the way.
F

Nala_001_f8I guess Dazzle Beach would be the closest thing we have.
ˆ

Nala_002_fzAll right. We'll want to create some cover for us to crouch behind and carve some trails to help bring prey out of hiding.
S

Nala_003_fEOh, and there's one more thing that makes a territory good for lions.
3
Player_002_choice_000_fA giant scratching post?
9
Player_002_choice_001_fA lion-sized kibble dispenser?
6
Player_002_choice_002_fIndustrial strength catnip?

Nala_004_f"You mean like a tree? Not exactly.
H

Nala_005_f:We need a spot where we can rest at the end of a long day.
/

Nala_014_f!A large, flat rock would be best.
c

Nala_017_fUMaybe I've got something like that... but if not, Scrooge's Store should. I'll check.
?

Nala_018_f1While you do that, I'll keep scouting for danger.
N

Nala_039_f@I'll come talk to you once I've made Dazzle Beach lion friendly!
%

Nala_020_fKibble...? What's that?
=

Nala_021_f/Forget it. It was just a joke. What do we need?
*

Nala_022_fI have no idea what that is.
l

Nala_015_f^Just a few things. With everything you've done around here already, it shouldn't be too tough.
h

Nala_019_fZThere must be something. Antelope, zebra, gazelle... they try to blend into the landscape.
P

Nala_016_fBBut if we make a hunting ground, the grasses should lure them out.
l

Nala_031_f^I understand. I'll keep looking around the Valley and try to find a way to make myself useful.
