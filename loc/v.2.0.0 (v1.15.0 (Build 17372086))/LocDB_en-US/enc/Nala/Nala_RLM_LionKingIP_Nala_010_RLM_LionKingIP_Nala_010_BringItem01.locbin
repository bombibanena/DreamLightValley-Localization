Nala_000_f0So these are the grubs that Simba loves so much?
<

Nala_005_f.I have to admit... they do look kind of tasty.

Nala_006_f+I must be really hungry. Well, here goes...
!

Nala_007_fHm. The taste is...
.
Player_000_choice_000_fIs it like chicken?
@
Player_000_choice_001_f%Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch?

Player_000_choice_002_fEh, you'll learn to love it.
U

Nala_008_fGI'm not sure, but I can see how Simba started to like it after a while.
I

Nala_013_f;It's definitely hyenas, but this time it's not just a pack.
A

Nala_014_f3It's as many as a herd. I counted hundreds of them.


Nala_015_fSimba and I can handle ourselves against some of them. But their numbers... there are just too many. We're completely surrounded.
?

Nala_016_f1If only we had a herd of lions to fight them off.


Nala_017_fNala! That's it!
R

Nala_018_fDWe may not have a herd, but we could trick them into thinking we do.
#

Nala_019_fHow would we do that?
Z

Nala_020_fLWe just need to make it SOUND like we have a hundred lions in this jungle...
[

Nala_021_fMI'm going to <Lore>sneak back to my Village and try to find something</Lore>.
F

Nala_001_f8They're sort of... crackly and squishy at the same time.
^

Nala_022_fPI'll <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>. I'll bet he has something that would help.
F

Nala_023_f8All right. Simba and I will try to hold back the hyenas.


Nala_024_fBut please hurry.
'

Nala_009_fHey... did you hear that?


Nala_010_f
Hear what?
)

Nala_011_fShh! Stay quiet and listen.
;

Nala_012_f-I think it's more hyenas. I'm going to check.
