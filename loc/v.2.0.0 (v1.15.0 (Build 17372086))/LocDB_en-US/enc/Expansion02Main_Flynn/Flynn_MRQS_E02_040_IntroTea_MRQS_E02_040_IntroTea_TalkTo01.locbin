Flynn_001_f&I've got something to show you, Flynn.
=
Flynn_002_f.Whoa! How did you draw that? It looks so real!
y
Flynn_003_fjIt's a picture. I used my camera. Uh, you know what, just think of it as like a... magic portrait machine.
µ
Flynn_004_f¥Sure. Whatever you say... Hold on Ã¢Â€Â” this magic portrait machine... Think it could get a picture of me that gets my nose right? Sketch artists always mess it up.

Player_000_choice_000_fIt could, yeah.
B
Player_000_choice_001_f'Maybe later. More important things now.
_
Player_000_choice_002_fDI'm afraid your nose is just too perfect for photography to capture.

Flynn_006_fNGreat! We'll have to schedule that in between all my other roguish adventures.
E
Flynn_017_f6Great idea! Let's <Lore>talk to the Lorekeeper</Lore>.
Z
Flynn_008_fKEr, but, seriously, are you showing me this magic portrait for a reason...?
u
Flynn_010_ffI was trying to explore the Teapot Falls in Everafter and I came across these things blocking the way.
.
Flynn_011_fHave you ever seen them before?
@
Flynn_012_f1Huh. Now that you mention it... I have seen them.
d
Flynn_013_fUThere were a couple of them inside the Fairy Tale Trial that I was cursed to protect.
?
Flynn_014_f0I wish I knew more about how to get rid of them.
O
Flynn_015_f@Hey, maybe there's a book you could read in the Library of Lore?
T
Flynn_016_fEOr a book you could talk to! The Lorekeeper probably knows something.
M
Flynn_007_f>More important than accurately portraying my nose? Not likely.
F
Flynn_009_f7Wow. I'm telling you: It's a curse to be this handsome.
