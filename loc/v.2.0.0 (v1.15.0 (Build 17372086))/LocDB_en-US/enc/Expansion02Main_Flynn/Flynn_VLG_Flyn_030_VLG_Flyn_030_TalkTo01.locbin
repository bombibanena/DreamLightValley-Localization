Flynn_000_f&So what did you find in the corridors?
Û
Flynn_001_fËNothing good. One is blocked by a giant wall that will only come down with fire, another is covered in really thick smoke, and the last has a door that can only be opened if we hit an unreachable target.
3
Flynn_002_f$Hmm. Yeah, that doesn't sound great.
O
Flynn_015_f@Any chance you have unknown powers that can take on all of that?
1
Player_000_choice_000_fOdds are pretty small.
I
Player_000_choice_001_f.Well, in a world where anything is possible...
6
Player_000_choice_002_fIs that a serious question?
8
Flynn_004_f)Aw, come on! We need to think positively!
X
Flynn_007_fINo amount of positivity is going to help me reach the unreachable, Flynn.
¥
Flynn_011_f•Point taken. Well, I guess it's time to recruit a crew! First, we need to <Lore>find someone who can breathe in smoke and can see in the dark</Lore>.
Ž
Flynn_003_fWe'll also need <Lore>some way to blow up that wall</Lore>. I can rig it with fireworks if you find someone who can light them.
†
Flynn_014_fwAnd for the third one, we need someone who can reach that target. Maybe <Lore>someone good with a bow and arrow</Lore>?
R
Flynn_012_fCOkay, I'll go ask around and see if any Villagers want to help out.
h
Flynn_013_fYYou should keep an eye out for Maleficent and make sure she doesn't catch on to our plan.

Flynn_005_f	Still no.
H
Flynn_008_f9Wow, way to get my hopes up and then dash them to pieces.
E
Flynn_009_f6You were asking if I can reach the unreachable, Flynn.

Flynn_006_f... Yes?
]
Flynn_010_fNThen to answer seriously: No, I am not suddenly able to reach the unreachable.
