Flynn_002_f#Okay... This place is... different.
I
Flynn_004_f:I wonder what's up with that <Lore>big empty table</Lore>.
G
Player_001_choice_000_f,Maybe we need to place the chairs around it?
C
Player_001_choice_001_f(Maybe there's supposed to be food on it?
P
Player_001_choice_002_f5Maybe we're supposed to build a pillow fort under it?
M
Flynn_009_f>That would make sense. Tables, chairs Ã¢Â€Â” they go together.
^
Flynn_003_fOAnd what do you think's up with that <Lore>clock on the wall</Lore> over there?
;
Player_000_choice_000_f Maybe we need to move the hands?
4
Player_000_choice_001_fMaybe we should smash it?
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$Maybe it's ticking down to our doom?
'
Flynn_005_fI say you give it a try!
o
Flynn_008_f`Maybe you should <Lore>look for some instructions around here</Lore>. There has to be something!
ª
Flynn_006_fšTake it from someone who's, shall we say, entered a few spaces uninvited Ã¢Â€Â” smashing's an amateur move. Makes a lot of noise, gets glass everywhere...
{
Flynn_007_flThat would be exciting. But I don't think it's THAT kind of clock. The hands don't seem to be moving at all.
u
Flynn_010_ff"Supposed to"? I don't know. But "should"? Definitely! Or else it's a waste of a perfectly good table.
T
Flynn_011_fEI somehow doubt that, not least because I don't see any pillows here.
