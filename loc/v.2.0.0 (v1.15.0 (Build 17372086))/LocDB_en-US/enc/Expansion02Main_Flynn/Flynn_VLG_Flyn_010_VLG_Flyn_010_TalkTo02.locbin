Flynn_000_fKHi Flynn! Everyone's items have been returned and no one is upset with you.
;
Flynn_001_f,Oh, I cannot tell you what a relief that is!
C
Flynn_002_f4Um... no offense, but this place is a bit of a mess.
3
Player_000_choice_000_fIs everything all right?
/
Player_000_choice_001_fHow did this happen?
9
Player_000_choice_002_fDid you become the Wolf again?
2
Flynn_003_f#Huh? Oh, yeah. Of course. I'm fine.
#
Flynn_006_fYou don't seem fine.
^
Flynn_009_fOWhat? Can't a guy live in a little squalor without being interrogated about it?
6
Player_002_choice_000_fI'm just worried about you.
9
Player_002_choice_001_fI've never seen you like this.
*
Player_002_choice_002_fDefensive much?
?
Flynn_014_f0It really seems like you're sad about something.
,
Flynn_017_fSad? ME? Don't be ridiculous.
€
Flynn_018_fqI mean, sure, things are kind of a mess in here, and I DID just spend a bunch of time under Maleficent's curse...
e
Flynn_027_fV...but I definitely do NOT miss <Lore>Rapunzel</Lore> in an almost incapacitating way.
8
Flynn_019_f)And I'm most definitely not sad about it.
@
Flynn_028_f1Ah, so THAT'S what's going on! You miss Rapunzel!
˜
Flynn_030_fˆHey, just because every time I think about talking to her I get nervous and my hands get strangely sweaty, that doesn't mean I MISS her.
X
Flynn_033_fIFlynn... You're hung up on a girl! That's OKAY. I can help you with this.
p
Flynn_038_faLook. Handsome rogues like me don't get hung up on people. Even someone as wonderful as Rapunzel.
=
Player_001_choice_000_f"It's GOOD to have feelings, Flynn.
4
Player_001_choice_001_fSounds like denial to me.
@
Player_001_choice_002_f%Stop being stubborn. Let me help you.
,
Flynn_016_fSure, uh-huh. For you, maybe.
„
Flynn_011_fuOkay... I'm not getting through to you. Maybe you need to talk to someone who's been through something like you have.
3
Flynn_015_f$Okay, I'll bite. Who do you suggest?
m
Flynn_036_f^I was thinking Kristoff! Kristoff and Anna's relationship might have a lot of lessons for you.
f
Flynn_034_fWHe and Anna struggled a lot when he had to give up his memories. That was like a curse.
\
Flynn_012_fMHe's the only person I know in the Valley who might be able to relate to you.
V
Flynn_013_fG... Okay, fine. If it will make YOU feel better, I'll talk to Kristoff.
V
Flynn_022_fGI'll fill him in on the details, so you don't have to worry about that.
p
Flynn_035_faHe's dealing with a curse of his own. He can't remember Anna. And they're supposed to be engaged!
!
Flynn_010_fDenial? Me? Never.
E
Flynn_020_f6I appreciate the concern, but you don't have to worry.
-
Flynn_031_fWait. You know about Rapunzel?
n
Flynn_026_f_But I definitely do NOT miss <Lore>a certain blond girl</Lore> in an almost incapacitating way.

Flynn_004_f	Not sure.
/
Flynn_007_f Come on, Flynn; what's going on?
"
Flynn_005_fI don't think so...
,
Flynn_008_fThen what's going on in here?
