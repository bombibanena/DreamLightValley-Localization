/
Player_000_choice_000_fYes, I love stories!
)
Player_000_choice_001_fHm, no thanks.
8
Player_000_choice_002_fAre they REALLY true stories?
P
Flynn_001_fAI thought you might. Now, what kind of story do you want to hear?
8
Flynn_002_f)A daring escape, a high seas adventure...
q
Flynn_003_fbAnd, oh... there's the time I climbed a tower and met a girl with the LONGEST hair in the kingdom.

Player_001_choice_000_fDaring escape.

Player_001_choice_001_f
High seas.
/
Player_001_choice_002_fYour Rapunzel story!
V
Flynn_004_fGGood choice. So, after a misunderstanding with the local authorities...
W
Flynn_013_fHAnd I landed in a passing pirate ship below! (Talk about timing, right?)
A
Flynn_005_f2...I had landed myself briefly in a famous prison.
=
Flynn_006_f.There were only three ways to get in or out...
_
Flynn_007_fP...two heavily guarded gates and a dangerous path down the side of the mountain.
H
Flynn_008_f9Obviously, I chose the most daring escape route possible.
E
Flynn_009_f6So after stealing a key and sneaking out of my cell...
s
Flynn_010_fd...I found myself climbing down a narrow mountain trail, blasted by high winds, pursued by guards...
:
Flynn_011_f+...and inches away from falling to my doom.
f
Flynn_012_fWThen, just as the guards were about to catch me, I jumped off the side of the mountain!
H
Flynn_014_f9Well, this takes place JUST after my daring escape story.
U
Flynn_023_fFI disembarked when they reached port not too far from where I grew up.
{
Flynn_015_flThere I was: on the deck of a pirate ship, surrounded by the scurviest bunch of buccaneers you've ever seen.
`
Flynn_016_fQThey were a little surprised to see me, as I hadn't exactly asked to come aboard.
D
Flynn_017_f5Rather, I'd jumped off a cliff right onto their ship.
A
Flynn_018_f2I'm not gonna lie. There were a few tense moments.
b
Flynn_019_fSBut I quickly won them over with my natural charm and the story of my prison break!
e
Flynn_020_fVThe pirate captain was so impressed, he appointed me official storyteller of the ship.
u
Flynn_021_ffIt turns out that being at sea for months is dreadfully boring. Just a lot of water and not much else.
`
Flynn_022_fQThese guys were desperate for entertainment. And I had stories. So it worked out.
y
Flynn_024_fjOkay, so there was this crown, right? For the lost princess... And it was just sitting and gathering dust.
Š
Flynn_025_f{So, myself and two of my Ã¢Â€Â” ahem Ã¢Â€Â” colleagues, the Stabbington Brothers, decided that crown belonged in our hands.
q
Flynn_026_fbThen I decided it REALLY belonged in MY hands. As soon as we got the crown, I made a break for it.
„
Flynn_027_fuSoon, I found myself running through the forest, trying to find a safe place to hide when I stumbled upon this tower.
‡
Flynn_028_fxI climb it. And inside, there's this... young woman. Long blonde hair. Big green eyes. Killer swing with a frying pan...
Î
Flynn_029_f¾After the frying pan incident, I found out she'd hidden the crown. She said she'd give it to me once I took her to see the floating lights that always showed up in the sky on her birthday...
^
Flynn_030_fOAnd THAT was the beginning of what I think is the biggest adventure of my life.
9
Flynn_031_f*Even I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out.

Flynn_032_fSuit yourself.
A
Flynn_033_f2I guess some people can't appreciate a good story.
3
Flynn_034_f$Let me know if you change your mind.
K
Flynn_035_f<Of course! Would *I* make up stories just to impress people?
4
Flynn_036_f%Don't answer that. How about a story?
