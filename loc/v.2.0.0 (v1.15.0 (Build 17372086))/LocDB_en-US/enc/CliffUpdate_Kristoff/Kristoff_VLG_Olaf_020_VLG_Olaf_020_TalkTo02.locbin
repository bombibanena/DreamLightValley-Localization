Kristoff_000_fZYou want me to tell you about my adventures with Donald Duck when the Forgetting happened?
D
Kristoff_001_f2Uh... well, it really wasn't much of an adventure.
~
Kristoff_002_flWe camped out on the Sunlit Plateau for a while until the Giant Night Thorns started to creep up everywhere.
^
Kristoff_003_fLThen Donald saw something that got him really mad, and he tried to fight it.
:
Kristoff_004_f(Right! The huge dragon he told me about!
Y
Kristoff_005_fGDragon?! Not exactly. He just saw a shadow and thought it was a dragon.

Kristoff_006_fIt was a hummingbird.

Player_000_choice_000_fThat's not very heroic...

Player_000_choice_001_f!Hummingbirds can be pretty scary.

Player_000_choice_002_fWhat happened next?
b
Kristoff_007_fPLike I told you, it wasn't much of an adventure. We just kind of... hung around.

Kristoff_008_f+After that, we went to the Forgotten Lands.
b
Kristoff_009_fPThat's where the ground opened up and a giant sea monster grabbed Donald, right?
s
Kristoff_010_faUh... no. Donald stepped in a puddle and splashed water everywhere. Then a frog jumped out at us.
D
Player_001_choice_000_f)Definitely a frog...? Not a cool monster?

Player_001_choice_001_fYeesh...
X
Kristoff_011_fFSorry, {PlayerName}. I wish I had something more exciting to tell you.

Kristoff_012_fKAfter that, we went to the Forest of Valor, and... well, you know the rest.
Y
Kristoff_013_fGI'm guessing Donald's version of the story sounded a lot more dramatic.
m
Kristoff_014_f[But you should talk to Donald. I bet he'll make it sound a lot more heroic than I just did.

Kristoff_015_fWDonald stepped in a puddle and splashed water everywhere. Then a frog jumped out at us.

Kristoff_016_foGuess I haven't met the right kind of hummingbirds. Anyway, like I said, it really wasn't much of an adventure.

Kristoff_017_f5It was just a shadow, but he thought it was a dragon.
