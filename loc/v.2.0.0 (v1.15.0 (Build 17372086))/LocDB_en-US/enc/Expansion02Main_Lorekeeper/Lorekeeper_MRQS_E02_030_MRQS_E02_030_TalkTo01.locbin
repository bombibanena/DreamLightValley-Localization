Lorekeeper_000_fKAhh, {PlayerName}! Where has your story taken you? What have you uncovered?
M
Player_000_f=I journeyed into a dark forest in Everafter. That place is...
:
Player_000_choice_000_f...so beautiful and mysterious!
+
Player_000_choice_001_f...kinda creepy.
K
Player_000_choice_002_f0...not looking too good. There's ink everywhere!
`
Lorekeeper_001_fLYes, it is, isn't it? It's made up of the stories we loved most as children.
r
Lorekeeper_004_f^All of the lessons we learned and fables we cherished are there. Even the ones that scared us.
g
Lorekeeper_003_fSFor it's often by facing what frightens us that we grow and learn who we truly are.

Lorekeeper_006_f%I stumbled upon something else there.
\
Lorekeeper_007_fHIt was another of those gateways, like the one that I found in Mythopia!
B
Lorekeeper_009_f.Ahhh... I know exactly what you've discovered.
k
Lorekeeper_015_fWBeyond that gateway, you will find a <Lore>Fairy Tale Trial</Lore> waiting to test you.
}
Lorekeeper_010_fiWhen Maleficent took it upon herself to rewrite Everafter... to place her castle at its farthest reach...
n
Lorekeeper_011_fZ...the magic went wrong. It all became corrupted and jumbled up, like the pages of a book.
‹
Lorekeeper_012_fwAnd pieces of Maleficent's castle have been scattered across Everafter, spreading their corruption throughout the land!

Player_001_choice_000_fWhat will I find inside?

Player_001_choice_002_fWhat should I do next?
R
Lorekeeper_013_f>I suspect you'll find old fables and fairy tales gone askew...
K
Lorekeeper_017_f7...corrupted by the Mistress of All Evil's malevolence.
t
Lorekeeper_018_f`You'll have to set them right and reach the very heart of them to undo what Maleficent has done.
-
Lorekeeper_019_fSo what should I do next?
q
Lorekeeper_014_f]<Lore>Seek the aid of Merida</Lore>. She might just be able to help you get inside the Trial.
t
Lorekeeper_020_f`With each Trial you face, you draw one step closer to reaching Maleficent and rescuing the Vale!
Y
Lorekeeper_008_fEIt looked like some sort of... some sort of gateway, filled with ink.
d
Lorekeeper_002_fPChildren's stories often have at least a hint of something perilous, don't they?
•
Lorekeeper_005_f€I feared that might be the case. Once, it was beautiful, even if parts of it Ã¢Â€Â” like the forest Ã¢Â€Â” could be a bit scary.
