Mickey_008_fäI agree. There's nothing like working in my garden to help me feel peaceful. Especially when there aren't any Night Thorns to worry about.

Mickey_001_fÅWell, now that you know how to garden, why don't you get some Ingredients ready for the <ActivityItem>Fruit Salad</ActivityItem>?
