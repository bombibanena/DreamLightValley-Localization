Mickey_022_fFMinnie appeared when I was thinking about the picnics we used to have.
O
Mickey_023_f?I talked to Merlin, and he says it's all about remembering her!

Player_000_choice_003_f$So we hold the bow and remember her?
.
Player_000_choice_004_fSounds far-fetched.
`
Player_000_choice_005_fEMinnie's lost and alone. Do you really think she'll care about a bow?
