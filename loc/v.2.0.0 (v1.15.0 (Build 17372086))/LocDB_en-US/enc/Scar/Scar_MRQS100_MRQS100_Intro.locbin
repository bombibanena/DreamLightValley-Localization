Scar_005_f\Well, well. If it isn't {PlayerName}. It's been far too long since you came 'round to visit.
N

Scar_006_f@I was beginning to think you'd leave me trapped in here forever.
!
Player_000_choice_000_fScar?!
1
Player_000_choice_001_fDo we know each other?
L
Player_000_choice_002_f1You're so cute! Can I scratch you behind the ear?
(

Scar_007_fAh, so you do remember me.
P

Scar_013_fBBefore the Forgetting, you were one of my most loyal assistants...
8

Scar_015_f*...when *I* ruled over this entire Valley.
'
Player_001_choice_000_fHuh? Really?
(
Player_001_choice_001_fI doubt it...
5
Player_001_choice_002_fYou're exaggerating, Scar.
W

Scar_016_fIAbsolutely. Why, I may have let you watch over the rest of the Village...
@

Scar_057_f2Yes. This all began when YOU abandoned the Valley.
M

Scar_023_f?Though perhaps, with my guidance, you could set it all right...
1
Player_002_choice_000_fWhy should I help you?
6
Player_002_choice_001_fWhy did the Pillar dry out?
:
Player_002_choice_002_fJust tell me what I need to do.
d

Scar_017_fV...but when it comes to the Sunlit Plateau, everyone knows that I'M the rightful king.
e

Scar_019_fWOf course, there's little worth ruling over here since <Lore>the river dried up</Lore>.
)

Scar_059_fWhat happened to the river?
v

Scar_020_fhI can only presume that something's blocking it. And the land has grown so parched that there's no prey.
q

Scar_046_fcWithout water, there's no life. <Lore>The power within the Pillar of Nurturing has died out.</Lore>
õ

Scar_050_fåAnd now there's all sorts of pesky dark power in the air. If someone doesn't fix this soon, the whole Plateau will become an arid wasteland.
A

Scar_055_f3And the most tragic part is... it's all your fault.


Scar_056_fMy fault?! What?
Ä

Scar_022_frBecause it's your place in the food chain. The Valley was a far better place when I ruled it, with you at my side.
H
Player_003_choice_000_f-Hm. I could always use more help around here.
?
Player_003_choice_001_f$Uh... I have trouble believing that.
L
Player_003_choice_002_f1You're not the king of Dreamlight Valley, Scar!!!
K

Scar_024_f=You see? It's a fine arrangement. A quid pro quo, as it were.
9

Scar_030_f+Of course, if you're still not convinced...
ç

Scar_027_f...then don't do it for me. Do it to help the Village. Restoring the Sunlit Plateau will make life so much better for everyone.
E

Scar_039_f7Isn't that what a good ruler ought to do, {PlayerName}?
N

Scar_025_f@Trust me, {PlayerName}, and I promise: All will be as it should.
!

Scar_026_fPerhaps not... yet.
<

Scar_031_f.You're not exactly making me want to help you.
)

Scar_032_fWell, if that's the case...
P

Scar_028_fBBecause it's connected to the river that runs through the Plateau.
;

Scar_033_f-Without water, the Pillar has utterly broken.
å

Scar_034_f~And it seems to be connected to all the life on the Plateau. When one flourishes, so does the other. But when one is broken...
|

Scar_035_fnHuh. So they're connected to each other... feeding off each other, in a balance... almost like some sort of...
-
Player_004_choice_000_f...Circle of Life?
;
Player_004_choice_001_f ...oval of biological existence?
L

Scar_036_f>Ugh. Yes. But don't ever say that phrase in my presence again.
I

Scar_037_f;All the annoyance started when something blocked the river.
n

Scar_040_f`I've no idea what that could be, but I do know that it began at the same time as the Forgetting.
l

Scar_045_f^And not long after, those blasted rocks fell on my lair. I've been trapped in here ever since.
F

Scar_058_f8Now, wasn't that also when you abandoned the Village...?
4
Player_005_choice_000_fNone of this is my fault!
B
Player_005_choice_001_f'I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause this.
;
Player_005_choice_002_f Hey, do you want my help or not?
5

Scar_002_f'Oh, {PlayerName}. Everyone knows it is.
X

Scar_021_fJBut if you fix all this... it might make up for the trouble you've caused.
`

Scar_003_fROh, I know you didn't, {PlayerName}. It seems disaster just naturally follows you.
L

Scar_004_f>I'll help you... but you need to stop trying to manipulate me.
>

Scar_042_f0Ugh. You used to be so much more... persuadable.
?

Scar_038_f1Not exactly a poet, are you? But that's the idea.
X

Scar_029_fJ*sigh* Must I do everything myself...? Find out what's blocking the river.
y

Scar_041_fkThe water flows from the depths of the <Lore>Vitalys Mines</Lore> beneath the cliffs on the Sunlit Plateau.
M

Scar_047_f?There are mines beneath cliffs...? What did they mine in there?
L

Scar_048_f>I haven't the faintest idea, as it was nothing of value to me.
T

Scar_049_fFSearch the mines until you find what's blocking the flow of the river.
>

Scar_053_f0And then √¢¬Ä¬î and don't forget this part√¢¬Ä¬î


Scar_054_fFix it.
j

Scar_052_f\Only then will you restore life to my kingdom... and earn your way back into my good graces.
R

Scar_018_fDOh, fine. If you insist... you ruled over the rest of the Village...
8

Scar_008_f*... Oh, you really don't remember, do you?


Scar_009_fYou could try...
B

Scar_010_f4...if you'd like to become acquainted with my claws.


Scar_011_fUh... no thanks.
>

Scar_012_f0Don't mistake my conviviality for √É¬©galit√É¬©.
,

Scar_014_fIn fact, quite the contrary...
