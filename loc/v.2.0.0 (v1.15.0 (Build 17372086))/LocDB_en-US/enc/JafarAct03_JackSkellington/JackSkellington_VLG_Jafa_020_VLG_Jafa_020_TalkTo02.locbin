JackSkellington_001_f.Hi, Jack! How's the scientific research going?
a
JackSkellington_002_fHBrilliantly! I'm very close to isolating an essence of Easter chocolate!
F
JackSkellington_003_f-Cool! Think I could get some advice from you?
p
JackSkellington_000_fWI'm trying to track down some of the Essences around here. What do you know about them?
‡
JackSkellington_013_fnWell, that depends on what you already know. Shall I explain the distinction between Major and Minor Essences?
'
Player_000_choice_000_fYes, please!
0
Player_000_choice_001_fNah, I'm fine; go on.
¯
JackSkellington_023_f•They combine at a 3:1 ratio Ã¢Â€Â” three Minor Essences to one Major. However, knowing which ones to mix to get the result you want can be difficult.
}
JackSkellington_010_fdThe <ActivityItem>Essence of Wonder</ActivityItem> is most interesting and very relevant to my work.
n
JackSkellington_011_fUCool. Maybe Jafar and I should try to work with that one too. How did you isolate it?
:
JackSkellington_021_f!Sadly, I've never been able to...
³
JackSkellington_022_f™Though I do know that one of its components is the <ActivityItem>Minor Essence of Excitement</ActivityItem>. Perhaps if you try, you'll have better luck!
†
JackSkellington_012_fmHere, take this <ActivityItem>Holiday Seed</ActivityItem>. If you plant it, it will grow into a special tree.
‡
JackSkellington_015_fnThen you and Jafar should be able to extract the <ActivityItem>Essence of Excitement</ActivityItem> from that.
}
JackSkellington_017_fdOh, and {PlayerName}... has anyone told you about the <ActivityItem>Emotive Essences</ActivityItem>?
6
JackSkellington_018_fOh, no Ã¢Â€Â” what are those?
¬
JackSkellington_019_f’Extremely elusive Essences. They can't be refined from any item or resource. Instead, you must perform actions to call them forth from Dreamlight.
±
JackSkellington_014_f—I know of the <ActivityItem>Essence of Benevolence</ActivityItem> and the <ActivityItem>Essence of Wisdom</ActivityItem>, but there could be even more!
.
JackSkellington_016_fPerfect, thanks Jack!
N
JackSkellington_020_f5Why don't you take this? Wouldn't want you to forget.
ˆ
JackSkellington_004_foI'm helping Jafar with some alchemy and well... it seems like things function differently in Dreamlight Valley.
m
JackSkellington_005_fTOf course! I ran into that exact same issue. I had to redo all my prior experiments!
v
JackSkellington_006_f]Think you could share some of the discoveries you've made to point us in the right direction?
‹
JackSkellington_007_frWell, I've come to the conclusion that the Valley has a number of <Lore>Essences</Lore> at the heart of its magic.
)
JackSkellington_008_fHow fascinating!
„
JackSkellington_009_fkIndeed! I hypothesize that there are dozens of Essences. However, I've only managed to explore one of them.
