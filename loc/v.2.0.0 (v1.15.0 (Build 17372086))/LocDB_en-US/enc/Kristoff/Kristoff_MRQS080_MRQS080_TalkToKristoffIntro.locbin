Kristoff_004_fSomeone's here?
1
Kristoff_005_fWait... SOMEONE'S HERE! WOOHOO!
H
Kristoff_006_f6Sorry. I've just been lost in these woods for so long.
<
Player_001_choice_000_f!What were you doing in the woods?
.
Player_001_choice_001_fAre you here alone?
,
Player_001_choice_002_fDo you need help?
‰
Kristoff_007_fwWell, Donald Duck and I were searching the Valley for something to help fight the Night Thorns and stop the Forgetting.
A
Kristoff_000_f/But I sort of... lost him. Or maybe he lost me.
7
Player_000_choice_000_fHow do you lose Donald Duck?
9
Player_000_choice_001_fI'm sure it wasn't your fault.
+
Player_000_choice_002_fIs he in danger?
8
Kristoff_002_f&It's actually easier than you'd think.
d
Kristoff_008_fRWe were in the <Lore>Forest of Valor</Lore> when the Night Thorns blocked us in...
š
Kristoff_019_f‡...and that's when we saw a <Lore>Dark Entity</Lore> removing the <ActivityItem>Orb of Courage</ActivityItem> from the Forest Pillar...
\
Kristoff_031_fJDark Entity? It must have been the Forgotten! Ursula warned me about this.
V
Kristoff_032_fDNever heard of 'em... but whoever it was, they didn't seem friendly.
„
Kristoff_017_frOut of the blue, they just opened a... a doorway and stepped through it! That <Lore>Dark Portal</Lore> over there.
Z
Kristoff_014_fHThen Donald ran right through the portal, chasing after the Dark Entity.
*
Player_000_choice_003_fThat was brave!
,
Player_000_choice_004_fThat was foolish!
B
Player_000_choice_005_f'Classic Donald Duck. Always in trouble.
4
Kristoff_020_f"Brave? Maybe. Foolish? Definitely!
¬
Kristoff_018_f™I tried to follow him, but he yelled at me to stay put and guard his back. I wanted to argue with him, but you really can't win a fight with Donald Duck.
5
Kristoff_015_f#And that's the last time I saw him.
;
Kristoff_016_f)It's been so long; I hope he's all right.
–
Kristoff_010_fƒHey... if you were able to remove the Thorns and find me Ã¢Â€Â” maybe you're powerful enough to go through the portal and save him!
1
Player_000_choice_006_fNever fear. I'm on it!
3
Player_000_choice_007_fGulp. Here goes nothing.
8
Player_000_choice_008_fToo scared to do it yourself?
H
Kristoff_026_f6Whoa, I wish you'd come to the Valley a long time ago.
i
Kristoff_027_fWThere's something... special about you... I don't know why, but I know you can do this.
k
Kristoff_030_fYJust step through the portal. And don't worry. I'll be waiting for you when you get back.
"
Kristoff_028_fAw, don't worry.
w
Kristoff_023_feHey! Not scared. Just... Well, I guess I forgot what had happened. I didn't remember until I saw you.
d
Kristoff_029_fRBut that's not the reason I think you should be the one to go through that portal.
4
Kristoff_021_f"Maybe, but we had to do something!
b
Kristoff_022_fPI just hope this time he hasn't gotten himself into trouble he can't get out of.
^
Kristoff_003_fLThanks for saying that. I've been kicking myself ever since we got split up.
1
Kristoff_009_fI really hope not... But maybe.
a
Kristoff_011_fONo. I mean... yeah... or maybe... I was with someone, but I can't find him now.
Œ
Kristoff_013_fzYou see, Donald Duck and I were searching the Valley for something to help fight the Night Thorns and stop the Forgetting.
%
Kristoff_012_fYou could say that.
