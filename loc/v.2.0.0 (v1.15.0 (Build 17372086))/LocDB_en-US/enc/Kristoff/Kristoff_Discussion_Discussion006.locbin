Player_000_choice_001_fI think it's more magical.
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&I'm starting to think of it as normal.
!
Kristoff_001_fYes! Thank you!
i
Kristoff_004_fWThis isn't the kind of magic I'm used to. Some things here just don't make sense to me.
,
Player_000_choice_003_fYeah. Me neither.
B
Player_000_choice_004_f'Is it different from the trolls' magic?

Player_000_choice_005_fIs it like Elsa's magic?
B
Kristoff_005_f0Phew! I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed.
p
Kristoff_006_f^Totally different! They're love experts and never confuse things or make you lose your memory.
m
Kristoff_007_f[No. Elsa's magic is ice and snow. Pretty useful stuff, actually, speaking as an ice expert.
