Kristoff_000_fGIs talking about feelings as hard for you as it is for me? Why is that?

Player_000_choice_000_fBecause they're important.

Player_000_choice_001_fBecause they're scary.
1
Player_000_choice_002_fBecause they're weird.

Kristoff_001_fMI guess that makes sense. You don't want to mess up something that important.
?
Kristoff_002_f-And it's easy to get confused about feelings.

Kristoff_003_f-How do YOU talk about feelings, {PlayerName}?

Player_001_choice_000_f
Be honest.
(
Player_001_choice_001_fBe sensitive.
5
Player_001_choice_002_fJust ignore your feelings.
p
Kristoff_009_f^I'm always honest. It's just sometimes the words I use don't end up saying what I really mean.
^
Kristoff_010_fLLike one time I called Anna crazy for getting engaged to a man she just met.
¯
Kristoff_011_fœThat wasn't the right word at all. I should have said "impetuous," or "eager," or "passionate"! Because Anna is all those things, and I love that about her.
u
Kristoff_012_fcYeah, being sensitive isn't really something I learned while climbing mountains and harvesting ice.
F
Kristoff_013_f4But ever since I met Anna, I've been trying my best.
E
Kristoff_014_f3Does that work? I don't know if that's a good idea.
Ž
Kristoff_004_f|Wait Ã¢Â€Â” why would feelings be scary? They can't bite you, like wolves. You can't fall off the side of a feeling and die.
w
Kristoff_005_feThey just sit inside of you, always there, haunting your every waking moment and changing everything.
D
Kristoff_006_f2... Yep. You're right. Feelings can be terrifying.
y
Kristoff_007_fgYou're right, feelings ARE weird. Things were so much simpler when it was just me, Sven and the trolls!
R
Kristoff_008_f@Simpler... but not as amazing. So I guess feelings are worth it.
