Kristoff_000_fMHey, great looking <ActivityItem>Lye</ActivityItem>, {PlayerName}! Nice work.

Kristoff_001_f£Okay, the next Ingredient we need for <ActivityItem>Soap</ActivityItem> is <ActivityItem>Oil</ActivityItem>. I usually use <ActivityItem>Carrot</ActivityItem> oil.

Kristoff_002_f†Sure you could do that... but why not mix it up? Let's add something else. Maui has pretty great hair. We could find out what he uses.

Player_000_choice_000_fI'll ask him.
o
Player_000_choice_001_fTMy guess... it must have something to do with <ActivityItem>Coconuts</ActivityItem>.
\
Player_000_choice_002_fAHe loves to talk about himself, so it'll be easy to get the info.

Kristoff_003_fThanks!
q
Kristoff_004_f_That makes sense, but I don't know anything about coconuts. You might wanna ask him to be sure.
