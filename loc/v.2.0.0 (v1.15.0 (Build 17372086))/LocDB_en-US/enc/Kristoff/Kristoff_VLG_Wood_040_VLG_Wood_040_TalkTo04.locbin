Kristoff_002_fIHey, how's it going with the Carousel? I saw you made some repairs to it.
j
Kristoff_000_fXIt's only missing one thing. There's an enchantment we need to do to turn on the lights.

Player_000_choice_002_f"...something with reindeer, maybe?
U
Kristoff_004_fCI have something. It's not magical, exactly, but it's close enough.

Kristoff_007_f>Maybe you don't know this, but I was kinda raised by trolls...

Kristoff_003_ffThey were great. A little pushy, but really nice. They made me feel like I was a part of their family.

Kristoff_008_f…So, I've got this little troll statue that I whittled to remember them by. I'm happy to let you borrow it to help Woody. Here you go.
H
Kristoff_005_f6I don't know if it's iconic, but I may have something.
r
Kristoff_006_f`Actually, I've got an idea. And this may surprise you, but it's got nothing to do with reindeer.
