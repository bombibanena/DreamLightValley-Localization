Player_000_choice_000_fDaisy wants to make up.

Player_000_choice_001_fIt was an accident.

Player_000_choice_002_fGet a grip, Donald.

Donald_006_fShe does?! Hooray!
ª
Donald_001_f™I gotta do something for her! Something special √¢¬Ä¬î maybe a moonlit cruise? Or I could plant a field of a million daisies, or write her the best love song of all time?

Player_001_choice_000_fLet's start with the wardrobe.

Donald_012_fHey, that's a great idea!
j
Donald_009_fZLet's get started right away. If you round up plans and the tools, I'll get the materials.
Ü
Donald_010_fvOh boy, oh boy! Daisy's gonna be so happy! Come see me as soon as you <Lore>get the materials for the wardrobe</Lore>.
Ω
Donald_005_f¨Well, Daisy deserves the best! Oh, but growing an entire flower field or writing the greatest song ever might take awhile. Maybe we should start by finishing that wardrobe.

Donald_007_fyYou're right, but... Somehow, these things always happen to me. And Daisy ends up losing. Ya know what? I gotta fix this!

Donald_008_frWAAAAKKKK!!! How dare you?! I√¢¬Ä¬î Uh-oh, there I go again. You're right. It was an accident. I gotta fix things.
