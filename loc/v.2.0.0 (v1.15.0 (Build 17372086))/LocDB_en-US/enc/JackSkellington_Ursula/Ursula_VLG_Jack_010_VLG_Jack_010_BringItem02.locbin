Player_000_choice_001_f7The Fairy Godmother would never do something like that!

Y
Ursula_002_fII hope you'll be a good influence on that Jack Skellington in the future.
<
Ursula_003_f,Speaking of Jack... where did he run off to?
R
Ursula_004_fBWell, we were discussing royalty and that good-for-nothing Triton.
l
Ursula_005_f\And he mentioned that he was also royalty Ã¢Â€Â” the king of pumpkins or some such nonsense.
„
Ursula_006_ftI said something about that goody two-shoes Fairy Godmother and her pumpkin House, and he seemed quite interested...
*
Ursula_007_fUh-oh. That can't be good.
l
Ursula_008_f\I must admit, I am rather curious. Be a dear and let me know if he gets turned into a mouse.
R
Ursula_009_fBThat's right. Check on Jack before he instigates another calamity!
O
Ursula_010_f?Still, I better go talk to Jack before he causes any trouble...
