PrinceEric_002_fThanks! So on my last expedition, I was sailing by some mysterious ruins. My Compass started to go haywire... I think some sort of magic was messing with it.

Player_000_choice_003_f%We need to get to the bottom of this!

Player_000_choice_004_f#Magic sure causes a lot of trouble.

PrinceEric_004_fI agree.
f
PrinceEric_007_fRI found an odd Valley artifact while I was sailing by the ruins. Then a storm hit.
W
PrinceEric_005_fCI bet there's more to find in that area if I could just get closer.
ˆ
PrinceEric_011_ftBut when I do, my Compass is useless. So I was thinking Ã¢Â€Â” what if we could enchant it to get through the magic?

PrinceEric_008_fDThen I could sell the blueprints for all kinds of amazing artifacts!
P
PrinceEric_006_f<I'll ask Merlin. He knows a thing or two about enchantments.
˜
PrinceEric_010_fƒThat would be great! Here, take my Compass and the artifact I found. Maybe he can enchant the Compass to lead us back to the ruins.

PrinceEric_001_f‚I'll say. Magic's been nothing but trouble for Ariel and me. But then again, we couldn't be together on land without it. Anyway...
