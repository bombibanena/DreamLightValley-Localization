Player_001_choice_000_fYes. Tell me everything.

Player_001_choice_003_fSome other time, sorry.

PrinceEric_000_fQWhile she had me in her little "garden," Ursula liked to taunt me with something.
Ÿ
PrinceEric_010_fŠShe said there was a way that Ariel wouldn't have to be torn between worlds anymore. That we could be together on land whenever we wanted.
p
PrinceEric_002_f\She said there's a kind of magic that would allow Ariel to change between human and mermaid.
™
PrinceEric_001_f„I've been looking in every book in Merlin's library, but I can't figure out what she was talking about. It must be Dreamlight Magic.
R
Player_000_fBHmm. So it's all about changing shape... I should speak to Maui...

Player_000_choice_000_fHe's got a power like that.
^
Player_000_choice_001_fCHe's been around a long time. I bet he's seen a lot of weird magic.

Player_000_choice_002_fHe's a demigod after all.

PrinceEric_005_f Right! Maybe he can teach Ariel.
U
PrinceEric_008_fAThanks, {PlayerName}. Come back and see me after you talk to him.
\
PrinceEric_006_fHYeah, maybe he heard about something like this on one of his adventures.
I
PrinceEric_007_f5Yeah, he probably knows all about this sort of stuff.
E
PrinceEric_004_f1That's okay. I'll be here when you have the time.
