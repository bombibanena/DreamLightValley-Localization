Player_000_choice_002_fBut you're usually so careful.
`

Remy_006_fRThat would be great! If anybody can do it, it's you. Okay, here's what happened...
¥

Remy_007_f–I was reading the novel Ã¢Â€Â” <ActivityItem>Extraordinary RATventures</ActivityItem>, about a rat adventurer Ã¢Â€Â” on the pontoon on Dazzle Beach...

Remy_014_f8But then Donald tripped on a turtle and started yelling.


Remy_009_fqHe startled me so much I dropped the <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> in the water. It's gotta be ruined, right?

Remy_011_f@You think so? I guess that would be a pretty Merlin thing to do.
s

Remy_012_feI'll <Lore>try to fish it out from Dazzle Beach</Lore> once I get the rest of the books back. Thanks!
