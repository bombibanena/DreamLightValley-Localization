*

Olaf_001_fHooray! That means I'm "it."
r

Olaf_002_fdNow, it's your turn to hide. My advice: Choose a good spot. Anna says my finding abilities are epic!
!
Player_000_choice_000_fOlaf?!
/
Player_000_choice_001_fHuh? Is this a game?
6
Player_000_choice_002_fWhat are you doing in here?
%

Olaf_003_f{PlayerName}! It's you!
:

Olaf_004_f,Wait Ã¢Â€Â” you look taller than I remember.
l

Olaf_005_f^I suppose the last time we saw each other was a long time ago. Way back before the Forgetting.
5

Olaf_006_f'Does that mean you're all grown up now?
(
Player_001_choice_000_fThat's right.
D
Player_001_choice_001_f)I guess so. Even if I don't feel like it.
M
Player_001_choice_002_f2"Grown up" is a state of mind. I'm a kid at heart.
N

Olaf_007_f@Well, I hope you're not too grown up to finish playing our game.
D

Olaf_008_f6Now it's your turn to hide and my turn to seek. Ready?
5

Olaf_009_f'Let's hide and seek later. But first...
.
Player_002_choice_000_fWhat is this place?
0
Player_002_choice_001_fWhat happened to you?
B
Player_002_choice_002_f'I need your help fixing a magical mess.
\

Olaf_010_fNYou know, I'm not exactly sure. I think maybe it used to be your special room.
0

Olaf_011_f"My special room? What do you mean?
>

Olaf_012_f0Well, you came here when you wanted to be alone.
c

Olaf_013_fUTo get away from all the complexities of life and ponder the meaning of the universe.
J
Player_003_choice_000_f/That makes sense. We all need time to be alone.
:
Player_003_choice_001_fBut I love being around people.
:
Player_003_choice_002_fI wish I could remember this...


Olaf_014_fThat is so true.
V

Olaf_015_fHThere's so much strange magic in here. I wonder where it all comes from.
G

Olaf_016_f9As do I. This truly is a chamber filled with mysteries...
g

Olaf_017_fYOh, but everyone needs solitude sometimes. When else would we ponder the great questions?
^

Olaf_018_fPDon't worry. I have an excellent memory. I'll do the remembering for both of us.
X

Olaf_019_fJWell, I followed you in here one day, there was a bright flash of light...
j

Olaf_020_f\...and then you were gone. And I've been here ever since. Mainly because I couldn't get out.
(
Player_004_choice_000_fThat's awful!
6
Player_004_choice_001_fA bright flash of light...?
A
Player_004_choice_002_f&You don't seem very bothered about it.
J

Olaf_021_f<Well, I did get lonely. And I missed you and all my friends.


Olaf_050_fsBut I've composed twelve epic novels in my head while I've been here. It's a series. I'll recite them to you later.
r

Olaf_022_fdTechnically, it's against the hide-and-seek rules to use magic, but I presume you had a good reason.
d

Olaf_023_fVWell, I did prove that it's a great hiding spot. Look how long it took you to find me!


Olaf_051_fsAnd I've composed twelve epic novels in my head while I've been here. It's a series. I'll recite them to you later.
N

Olaf_024_f@There's a magical blizzard that's threatening the whole Village.
]

Olaf_025_fOIf we're going to stop it, we need to find the Orb and restore the PillarÃ¢Â€Â”
]

Olaf_026_fOOoo, I very much want to help, but first I'm in need of some assistance myself.
X

Olaf_027_fJYou've probably noticed that I'm missing my nose, my buttons, and my arms.
C
Player_005_choice_000_f(I thought you looked a little different.
9
Player_005_choice_001_fWow, really? I hadn't noticed.
E
Player_005_choice_002_f*I didn't want to make a big deal about it.
_

Olaf_028_fQSome might like the minimalist look, but I'm much more fond of my full Olaf-ness.
u

Olaf_029_fgI'll help you get all your parts back. I think when I came in I saw some squirrels carrying them off...
B

Olaf_030_f4Oh, right! Silly me. Those squirrels are my friends.
L

Olaf_031_f>Did you know there are over two hundred species of squirrels?!
r

Olaf_032_fdBut the ones here don't look like the squirrels I've seen before. They're all mysterious and glow-y.
­

Olaf_033_fžStill, they like to play keep-away with me, which is nice. It helps to pass the time. They take my buttons and nose, and I chase them around to get them back.
&
Player_006_choice_000_fSounds fun.
@
Player_006_choice_001_f%Are you sure this was just a game...?


Olaf_034_fIt is!
+

Olaf_035_fEspecially for the squirrels.
m

Olaf_036_f_But this time, when you came in, the squirrels ran out right past you with my nose and buttons.
B

Olaf_037_f4I've only ever had to chase them around here before.
0

Olaf_038_f"Okay. I'll help you get them back.
B

Olaf_039_f4Great. <Lore>Let's chase down some squirrels!</Lore>
!

Olaf_040_fWell, I thought so.
a

Olaf_041_fSBut as for the squirrels... well, who can really comprehend the mind of a squirrel?
|

Olaf_042_fnThat's uncharacteristically unobservant of you. I would think it's as plain as the nose that's not on my face.
.

Olaf_043_f Thank you. That was very polite.
t

Olaf_044_ffThat's a relief! If you don't feel like a grown-up, then you won't be too grown-up to finish our game.
a

Olaf_045_fSOh, good! I was worried you'd be too busy with grown-up matters to finish our game.
W

Olaf_046_fIOf course, {PlayerName}! Don't you remember? We're playing hide-and-seek.
V

Olaf_047_fHI'm hiding from you, {PlayerName}. And you are...? C'mon, you know it...
9

Olaf_048_f+Okay, I'll help you out. You're seeking me.

Olaf_049_f*Do you need me to explain the rules again?
