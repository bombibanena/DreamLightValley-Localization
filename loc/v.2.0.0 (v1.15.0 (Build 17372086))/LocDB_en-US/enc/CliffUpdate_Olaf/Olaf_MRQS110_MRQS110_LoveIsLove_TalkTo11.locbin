Olaf_000_fcYou found a book? Is it the one we need? You'll have to read it to me since I can't turn the pages.
D

Olaf_001_f6Okay. It's called "So You Want to Open a Dark Portal."
j

Olaf_002_f\How conveniently specific! It sounds like it's exactly what we're looking for, {PlayerName}.
'
Player_000_choice_000_fI hope so...
(
Player_000_choice_001_fDo you think?

Player_000_choice_002_fNot a very imaginative title.

Olaf_003_f"I can't wait to hear what it says!
"

Olaf_012_fHow do I do that...?
q

Olaf_013_fcWell, there are some gems over there near the portal. But not all the colors. Some must be missing.
P

Olaf_014_fBDon't worry, {PlayerName}. I'm sure you can figure out what to do.
¦

Olaf_015_f—Finally, it says I need to whisper one of my darkest fears to the portal to seal the spell. I guess I should start thinking about what I'm afraid of...
R

Olaf_016_fDBut for now, I'll start by <Lore>making the Dreamlight Prism</Lore>.
q

Olaf_004_fc(This book... this must be how the Forgotten learned to open all those portals in the first place.)

Olaf_005_f/(No wonder they've been popping up everywhere.)
*

Olaf_006_fUm... Are you going to read?
†

Olaf_007_fxHmm... According to this, we'll need something called a <ActivityItem>Dreamlight Prism</ActivityItem> to fix the portal.
m

Olaf_008_f_There's a bunch of broken glass on the floor over there. I'll bet the Forgotten tried this too.
ˆ

Olaf_009_fzMaybe if you gather it up and replace the broken parts, we can get my arms back! Oh, and the Orb. Can't forget about that.
…

Olaf_010_fwIt says we'll need some <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem> and some <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>.
v

Olaf_011_fhBut once I fix it, I need to find some way to "channel all the colors of the rainbow" through the prism.

Olaf_017_f}Titles can be hard. I went through at least three dozen for each of the novels I've composed in my head while I've been here.
