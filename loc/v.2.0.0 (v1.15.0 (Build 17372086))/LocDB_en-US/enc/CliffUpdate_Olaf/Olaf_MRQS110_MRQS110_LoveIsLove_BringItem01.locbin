Olaf_000_fQYou got my nose and buttons back! Thank you! I'll feel much more like myself now.
c

Olaf_001_fUHey, did you know that squirrels use their tails to help them balance in high places?
9
Player_000_choice_000_fI did know that. It's so cool!
;
Player_000_choice_001_f I didn't know that. Fascinating.
I
Player_000_choice_002_f.That doesn't really seem relevant right now...
S

Olaf_002_fEI agree. Squirrels are a source of almost infinite interesting facts.
U

Olaf_003_fGAnd now we have one to add... They like to play keep-away with carrots.
N

Olaf_004_f@Are you ready, little nose? Let's put you back where you belong.
)

Olaf_005_fOh, this is so much better!
r

Olaf_006_fdI'd give you a warm hug to say thank you, but I'm still missing my arms, so that would be difficult.
3
Player_001_choice_000_fWhere could those be...?
;
Player_001_choice_001_f They've gotta be here somewhere.
@
Player_001_choice_002_f%*sigh* Okay, I'll go find two sticks.
z

Olaf_007_flOh! I Just remembered! It's not only my arms that are missing. They were holding something when I lost them.
C

Olaf_008_f5Didn't you say you were looking for some kind of Orb?
b

Olaf_009_fTWell, I was holding one when I got locked in here. Don't you just love coincidences?
I
Player_002_choice_000_f.So if we find your arms... we'll find the Orb!
J
Player_002_choice_001_f/Great. So just tell me where to find your arms.
K
Player_002_choice_002_f0You couldn't have told me this a little sooner?!
:

Olaf_010_f,Excellent deductive reasoning, {PlayerName}!
Å

Olaf_011_fsOoo! And we can also deduce that if I don't know what happened to my arms... I don't know what happened to the Orb.
8

Olaf_012_f*You don't know what happened to your arms?
!

Olaf_013_fAs I said before...
V

Olaf_014_fHAll I remember is that I walked in here, and there was a flash of light.
d

Olaf_015_fVThe next thing I knew, my arms were gone. And so was the Orb. And I was locked inside.
m

Olaf_016_f_Ugh. If only there were some way to tell exactly what happened in here. But it was so long ago.
B

Olaf_017_f4Well, if you don't remember, and I don't remember...
+

Olaf_018_f...maybe the water remembers!
7

Olaf_019_f)The water remembers...? What do you mean?
ë

Olaf_020_fÇOh, water has memory. It's disputed by many, but it's true. We'll just need to find a way to get it to share the memories with us.
?

Olaf_021_f1Hmm... Say, would Elsa know something about this?
Z

Olaf_022_fLElsa! That's it! She's very good at helping water show us what it remembers.
;

Olaf_023_f-All right. I'll go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore>.
y

Olaf_024_fkHmm... well, there's one person I always know I can go to when there's magical business I don't understand.
 

Olaf_025_fMerlin, of course.
^

Olaf_026_fPMerlin? Oh, he's the oldest and thus the most all-knowing person in the Village.
-

Olaf_027_fI'm sure he'll know what to do.
?

Olaf_028_f1I'll go <Lore>talk to Merlin</Lore> and find out.
1

Olaf_029_f#Hmm... let me think... umm... Nope!
6

Olaf_030_f(I have no idea what happened to my arms.


Olaf_031_fOh no. Seriously?
§

Olaf_032_fïIf I'd known your arms were holding the key to fixing all this, I would've looked for those before I worried about finding your nose. Where are they?
7

Olaf_033_f)Oh, but it's always a good time to learn.
<

Olaf_034_f.Even when squirrels have just taken your nose.
