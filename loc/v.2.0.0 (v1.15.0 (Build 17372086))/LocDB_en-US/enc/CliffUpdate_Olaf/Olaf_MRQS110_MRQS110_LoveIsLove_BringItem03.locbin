Player_000_choice_001_fI don't get it.
L
Player_000_choice_002_f1You should "arm" yourself with some better jokes.

G

Olaf_006_f9Well, I didn't just find your arms. I also found the Orb.

Olaf_008_f *gasp* No! What's wrong with it?
J

Olaf_009_f<The light inside it has gone out. The magic is just... gone.
_

Olaf_010_fQI don't think this is going to be enough to fix the Pillar and stop the blizzard.

Player_001_choice_002_fIt's hopeless. We're doomed.


Olaf_013_fI just have to figure out the mystery... Maybe there's a book in Merlin's library... or another memory somewhere... or... or...


Olaf_014_fAhem!
i

Olaf_015_f[I may not know how to fix the Orb, but I do know one thing that can make everything better.

L
Player_002_choice_001_f1I still feel awful, but I appreciate the thought.
*

Olaf_018_fYep. Warm hugs are the best.

Olaf_027_f Does this mean we saved the day?
$

Olaf_028_fAlmost, but not quite.
U

Olaf_029_fGI still need to <Lore>put this Orb back in the Pillar</Lore>. Let's go!


Olaf_019_fWait a second...
9

Olaf_020_f+The Orb started to glow when you hugged me.

Olaf_026_f9Oh. Then I guess I did know how to fix the Orb after all.
;

Olaf_030_f-Oh. Well, two hugs are even better thanÃ¢Â€Â”

Olaf_031_f'Wait! I don't think I need another one.
£

Olaf_032_f”The blizzard's going to swallow up all of Dreamlight Valley, and nothing I do can fix this, and okay, maybe I'm freaking out just a little bitÃ¢Â€Â”
E

Olaf_033_f7That's okay. Not everyone gets sophisticated word play.
p

Olaf_034_fbYou're probably right. I haven't had anyone to practice my jokes on since I've been stuck in here.
&

Olaf_035_fHey, wait. "Arm" myself?
C

Olaf_036_f5That's brilliant! I will definitely have to use that.
