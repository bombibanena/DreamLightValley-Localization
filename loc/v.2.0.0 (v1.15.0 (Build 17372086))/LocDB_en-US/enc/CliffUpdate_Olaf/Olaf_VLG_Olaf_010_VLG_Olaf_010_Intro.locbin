Olaf_000_f‰Hello, {PlayerName}. I was just gonna come find you! I'm very happy to be back in the Village, but Ã¢Â€Â” oddly, it doesn't feel right...
G

Olaf_001_f9It's like something's... missing. I just don't know what.
Q

Olaf_002_fCYou're older and thus all-knowing. Could you help me figure it out?
:
Player_000_choice_000_fI'll try to help. Tell me more.
.
Player_000_choice_001_fI'm busy right now.
S

Olaf_003_fEWell, this place used to be full of joy and friendship and warm hugs.
†

Olaf_004_fxBut some of the Villagers don't seem happy at all. Like the grumpy lion and the lady who's always looking in the mirror.
u
Player_001_feGrumpy lion and lady who's always looking in the mirror...? Oh, you must mean Scar and Mother Gothel.
:
Player_001_choice_000_fYou can't make everybody happy.
I
Player_001_choice_001_f.What have you tried to make them happy so far?
F
Player_001_choice_002_f+We'll get a smile out of them. Don't worry.
m

Olaf_005_f_They're hungry for power. If they were happy, a lot of other people in the Village wouldn't be.
.

Olaf_014_f She didn't seem to be impressed.
V

Olaf_015_fHMaybe we could try giving them some gifts? That always cheers people up.
Š

Olaf_016_f|*gasp* What an incredible idea! I knew you could help me, {PlayerName}. You have the innate wisdom that comes with maturity.
P

Olaf_017_fBAnd I know just what to get them! Let's start with some flowers...
É

Olaf_018_fºSome <ActivityItem>Red Bromeliads</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Blue Passion Lilies</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>White Passion Lilies</ActivityItem> would make an exquisite bouquet.
Q

Olaf_019_fCAnd of course, we'll need some <ActivityItem>Salmon</ActivityItem>.


Olaf_020_fSalmon...? Why?
_

Olaf_021_fQJust trust me on this one, {PlayerName}. It's all going to make a wonderful gift.
]

Olaf_022_fOWhy don't you go find everything while I figure out what to write on the cards?
v

Olaf_023_fhAhem. "Dear Scar..." Next one, "Dear Mother Gothel..." Hmm. No. "To my most esteemed fellow Villager..."
£

Olaf_006_f”Wow. So you're saying that some conceptions of happiness are at odds with others and maximizing the happiness of everyone is practically impossible?
L

Olaf_007_f>Uhhhh... that's a very grown-up thought. Let's keep it simple.
T

Olaf_008_fFWhat have you tried doing to make Scar and Mother Gothel happy so far?
6

Olaf_009_f(Well, I tried to give Scar a warm hug...
O

Olaf_010_fA...but my permafrost got stuck to his fur, and he didn't like it.
I

Olaf_011_f;Then I tried to tell Mother Gothel some fascinating trivia.


Olaf_012_fLike what...?
d

Olaf_013_fVI told her that the average human breathes in and out twenty-two thousand times a day.
j

Olaf_024_f\We just have to keep trying. What have you done to make Mother Gothel and Scar happy so far?
[

Olaf_025_fMOkay. I'll just stay here and try to make the best out of what I can control!
