Olaf_000_fWow. Did you see that?!
m

Olaf_001_f_I must have interrupted the Forgotten while they were casting some sort of magical enchantment.

Olaf_002_f+And the Orb made the magic go wild in here.
2

Olaf_003_f$That must have been the flash I saw!
s
Player_000_fcSo this chamber... it must be the Forgotten's. And it was the Forgotten who locked you inside here!
<
Player_000_choice_000_f!I'm so sorry that happened, Olaf.
Z
Player_000_choice_001_f?I hope you learned a lesson about barging into secret chambers.
H

Olaf_004_f:That's okay. I know you wouldn't have wanted it to happen.
o

Olaf_012_faThey're all about magic, casting spells, making things float, <Lore>how to open portals</Lore>...

Olaf_013_f'Did you just say "how to open portals"?
L

Olaf_014_f>*gasp* How to open portals? Yes! And we need to open a portal!
?

Olaf_015_f1I guess I'll need to <Lore>find that book</Lore>.
o

Olaf_005_faAfter that, the Forgotten grabbed the Orb off the floor and threw it into that portal over there.
*

Olaf_006_fWith my arms still attached.
€

Olaf_007_frOh, but bright side! Now we know where the Orb is. Someone with arms can just reach inside the portal and grab it.
A

Olaf_008_f3I'd volunteer to do it myself but... ahem, no arms.
o

Olaf_009_faThat portal keeps flickering. Something's wrong with it. I don't think it's safe to reach inside.
M

Olaf_010_f?Hmm... Oh! Maybe there's a way to fix it in one of these books.
u

Olaf_011_fgSince my arms are missing, I couldn't turn the pages to read them. But the titles are very interesting.
f

Olaf_016_fXOh, I've learned many lessons, including that it's a great way to find new hiding spots.
