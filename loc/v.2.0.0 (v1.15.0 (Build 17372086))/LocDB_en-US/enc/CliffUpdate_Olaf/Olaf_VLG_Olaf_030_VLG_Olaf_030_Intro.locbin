Olaf_000_fhHi, {PlayerName}! So, good news... we're almost ready to put on the play. But I'll need your help first.

Player_000_choice_000_fSure! I'd love to help.
-
Player_000_choice_001_fI can't right now.
N

Olaf_001_f@That's wonderful! Because Donald and I have finished the script.
#

Olaf_002_fGreat! Can I read it?


Olaf_003_fOh no. Not yet.


Olaf_004_f... Why?
:

Olaf_005_f,Well, we have it all written in our minds...
7

Olaf_006_f)...but we haven't written any of it down.
A
Player_001_choice_000_f&Don't worry. That part's not too hard.
M
Player_001_choice_001_f2What?! Writing it down is the most important part!
8
Player_001_choice_002_fUh oh. We better get to work.
R

Olaf_007_fDI didn't want to interrupt our creative flow by going to find ink...
F

Olaf_008_f8...and I don't have anything to write it down on either.
k

Olaf_009_f]No problem. I'll get some <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem> so we can whip up some paper.
š

Olaf_010_f‹And I'll find some <ActivityItem>Purple Marsh Milk Weed</ActivityItem> and an <ActivityItem>Empty Vial</ActivityItem> to make you some ink.
m

Olaf_011_f_Fabulous! As soon as you have all that, bring it to Donald. He's going to write the story down.
A
Player_002_choice_000_f&You're not going to write it yourself?
.
Player_002_choice_001_fOkay, sounds great!
F

Olaf_012_f8Not this time. I have to focus on the ENTIRE production.
h

Olaf_013_fZOh, and one last thing! Could you ask Donald if he'll star as himself in the play? Thanks!
R

Olaf_014_fDI understand. Creativity really does need to happen on its own time.
