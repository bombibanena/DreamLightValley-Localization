Ursula_000_f`Welcome back, angelfish. And I see you held up your end of the bargain. Well, a deal's a deal...
J
Ursula_002_f:I'll let you in on a little secret about the Forgetting...
Œ
Ursula_003_f|Everyone talks about the Forgetting as if it were just some miserable thing that happened, like an algae bloom in the ocean.


Ursula_009_foOh, it is. And don't you wish we could get a little of that power for ourselves? But we can discuss that later.

Ursula_010_fNow there's a good question.
