w
MotherGothel_009_faBut I MUST know what it does! And what is this book inside? Does it have magical properties, too?

MotherGothel_010_fWell?
I
Player_001_choice_000_f.You really need to stop trying to steal magic.
A
Player_001_choice_001_f&What it does is none of your business.
I
Player_001_choice_002_f.If it does, it's not magic that will help you.
s

O
MotherGothel_023_f9Thankfully, I'm not trying to be polite to you right now.
ç
MotherGothel_025_fwI'm taking my Enchanted Flower back. And I better not see you lurking around Jasmine and Aladdin's House again! Got it?
\
MotherGothel_019_fFFine, fine. Take your flower. It wasn't doing anything special anyway.
{
MotherGothel_021_feFor example, I enjoy spending time with loved ones. You, on the other hand, enjoy STEALING from them.

MotherGothel_022_fAre we?
2
MotherGothel_024_fYes, that wasn't rhetorical.
?
MotherGothel_013_f)Don't be petulant, dear. It's unbecoming.
B
MotherGothel_016_f,I'm not really worried about that right now.
f
MotherGothel_014_fPHow can you be certain, darling? I have ideas for magic you've never dreamed of.
D
MotherGothel_017_f.Actually, in this case, I can be 100% certain.
g
MotherGothel_006_fQUgh! You take ONE child for her magical abilities and people REFUSE to forget it!
m
MotherGothel_011_fWHonestly, darling, holding a grudge like that will do nothing but keep you up at night.
