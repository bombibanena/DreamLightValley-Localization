Mickey_004_f(The blue one... is it made outta glass?!
Q
Mickey_006_fAAnd the green one... it seems more like a pet than a house plant!
y
Mickey_003_fiA lot of dangerous magic was running wild on Eternity Isle. I guess it made these flowers a bit... weird.
J
Mickey_007_f:Gosh, I don't know if Minnie would like any of these much.
X
Mickey_008_fHShe had enough trouble with magic during her time in the Here and There.

Mickey_010_f›Sorry I asked you to do all that, {PlayerName}. Do ya think since these flowers seem so magical that there's somebody else who could use 'em for somethin'?
Z
Player_000_choice_000_f?I'll bring them to Merlin. He can use them for his experiments.
W
Player_000_choice_001_f<I'll bring them to Ursula. She can use them for her potions.
U
Mickey_011_fEThat's a great idea! I bet Merlin would love to take a look at these.
‡
Mickey_013_fwThanks for helping, {PlayerName}, even if it didn't turn out exactly how we planned. Next time, I'll stick to petunias.

Mickey_012_fKYou sure about that, pal? What if she uses 'em to make somethin' dangerous?
[
Mickey_014_fKWhatever Ursula wants to use them for, she'll be in my debt. That's useful.

Mickey_015_f*Huh. Guess I'll have to trust you on that.
R
Mickey_009_fBAnd I wouldn't wanna risk upsetting her right after she gets back.
