Belle_000_fKYou caught some of the books! And look Ã¢Â€Â” the rest of them are falling!
9
Belle_001_f*Thank you for helping stop the book storm.
6
Player_000_choice_000_fAnything for an old friend.
L
Player_000_choice_001_f1That was just a typical day in Dreamlight Valley!
@
Player_000_choice_002_f%What started this in the first place?
P
Belle_009_fAOld friend? It's strange... I do feel as though we've met before.
…
Belle_010_fvThe truth is hard to explain and harder to believe... For now, just trust that I'm here to help you figure things out.
!
Belle_005_fDreamlight Valley?
T
Belle_011_fEIt's a magical place filled with wonder and adventure and friendship.
H
Belle_013_f9That sounds like somewhere from one of my favorite books.
V
Belle_014_fGIt's just like that! You should visit once we sort everything out here.
r
Belle_007_fcI'm not sure. The Beast and I had a disagreement. He asked me not to go into the West Wing again...
=
Belle_015_f.But there was something there I wanted to see.
1
Player_001_choice_000_fI'd do the same thing!
7
Player_001_choice_001_fHow did that make books fly?
;
Player_001_choice_002_f You two need to talk boundaries!
,
Belle_017_fYou must be curious, like me.
.
Belle_019_fI guess so! What happened next?
:
Belle_020_f+Well, he found me there and got very angry.
U
Belle_022_fFWe argued, then I left and came here to find something to read, but...
¡
Belle_023_f‘As soon as I opened my book, all the books started flying off the shelves in a storm! I don't think it's part of the enchantment on the castle...
^
Belle_024_fOIt must be Dreamlight Magic... The storm of books was reflecting your feelings.
¹
Belle_025_f©Dreamlight Magic...? I've never heard of that. But the Beast was the one who was most upset. He's locked himself in the West Wing, and he won't open the door for anyone.
3
Player_002_choice_000_fWe could ask him nicely.
C
Player_002_choice_001_f(Let's trick him into unlocking the door!
4
Player_002_choice_002_fI'll break the door down!
3
Belle_028_f$I've tried that. He won't answer me.
,
Belle_030_fThen I'll try talking to him.
9
Belle_032_f*I don't think he'll let you into the room.
9
Belle_034_f*Is there any other way into the West Wing?
{
Belle_035_flWell, when I first arrived at the castle, Lumiere did say something about a secret passage in the library...
š
Belle_036_fŠI've never found it. But you could <Lore>search the library</Lore> and see if you can. I'm going to put these books back on their shelves.
:
Player_003_choice_000_fYou had me at "secret passage."
;
Player_003_choice_001_f I'll start searching right away!
P
Player_003_choice_002_f5Maybe see if there's a book on relationship advice...

Belle_038_fI'm so excited!

Belle_041_f	I'm glad.
`
Belle_042_fQPlease come find me if you <Lore>locate the secret passage in the library</Lore>.
ƒ
Belle_002_ftYou might want to check by the <Lore>rolling ladder</Lore> in the corner. I felt a cold draft there the other day...
:
Belle_039_f+Thank you! I'm very grateful for your help.
6
Belle_040_f'Hmm... I suppose that might be helpful.
.
Belle_027_fThat would only upset him more.
'
Belle_031_fYou're probably right...
4
Belle_029_f%You actually sound a little like him.
r
Belle_033_fcBut even if you could break the door down, that wouldn't work. It would only make him more furious.
R
Belle_016_fCI don't know that it did. I think it must have been something else.
"
Belle_021_fWhat happened next?
I
Belle_018_f:I suppose I didn't understand how important it was to him.
