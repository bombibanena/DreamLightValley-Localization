ñ
Belle_000_fÜ{PlayerName}, thank you so much for your help. The Dreamlight Library has reopened, and I'm really looking forward to helping with it.
s
Belle_004_fdI was able to find the correct spots for all but three of these books. I'm hoping you can assist me.
z
Belle_005_fkThe first one is the sewing book you got from Mirabel √¢¬Ä¬î <ActivityItem>Crafty Creatures</ActivityItem>.
Ë
Belle_006_fÿThere are only three classifications that I haven't tried... <ActivityItem>Owl Care</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>How to Train Your Sugar Pot</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Wandless Arts and Crafts</ActivityItem>.
S

b
Belle_031_fSThat was the right shelf and on the first try. It seems we make a rather good team.
Q
Belle_032_fBOh, perhaps this book is about something different than I thought.
*
Belle_033_fLet me see if you're right.
w
Belle_034_fhIt happened again. The book flew off the shelf the moment I put it there. It must belong somewhere else.

Belle_035_flThat's odd. As soon as I put the <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> on the shelf, it flew back into my hands.

W
Belle_037_fHReally? Well, I'm not a magic expert like you, so I'll follow your lead.

Belle_039_f!I'll just go put it on the shelf.
b
Belle_040_fSI'm afraid it refuses to stay on this shelf. We must have the wrong classification.
g
Belle_026_fXI put the <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> back on the shelf, and nothing odd happened.
S
Belle_027_fDMerlin told us the Library would let us know if we made a mistake...
<
Belle_028_f-So, I think we got it right on the first try.
S
Belle_023_fDHmm... That doesn't feel quite right, but let me try to put it back.

Belle_012_f&It doesn't want to stay on that shelf.

Belle_024_f.Well, I suppose it's worth a try. Let's see...
C
Belle_009_f4That was my first choice. I hope it's the right one.
S
Belle_025_fDOh, good. The <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> stayed on the shelf!
©
Belle_010_fôNow the second <ActivityItem>Book</ActivityItem> we need to shelve is the one Mr. McDuck borrowed called <ActivityItem>Coin Pool Theory</ActivityItem>...
„
Belle_011_f”The classifications I haven't tried are <ActivityItem>Monetary Physics and Swim Strokes</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Metamorphosis for Beginners</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Magic Duels 101</ActivityItem>.

Belle_008_fTGoodness, do you think the book is about swimming in actual coins? Is that possible?
d
Belle_013_fUI'll most certainly put it on my reading list. But for now, I'll put it on the shelf.
E
Belle_029_f6It worked! The book is back home on the correct shelf.
ë
Belle_001_fÅNow, the last book is one I got from Ursula √¢¬Ä¬î <ActivityItem>Cursed Negotiations: Making Better Devious Deals</ActivityItem>.
.
Belle_003_fShe said it was very inspiring.
ﬁ
Belle_007_fŒThe only shelves I haven't tried are <ActivityItem>Wizard Interior Design</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Magical Contract Law</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Prophecies: What Could Go Wrong?</ActivityItem>

[
Belle_055_fLNo, it doesn't want to stay on that shelf either. It must be something else.

Belle_051_f$It must be one of the other options.
[
Belle_047_fLIt does sound like a book about magical law, doesn't it? I'll just go see...
s
Belle_058_fdThat was the right category! Which means all the <ActivityItem>Books</ActivityItem> are now shelved.
J

Belle_045_fùNow that we're finished, I had planned to start reading one of the books in the Dreamlight Library. I've made a list of the ones I'm most looking forward to.
ç
Belle_017_f~But while I was placing <ActivityItem>Cursed Negotiations: Making Better Devious Deals</ActivityItem> back where it belongs...
Y
Belle_041_fJI found something at the back of the shelf, hidden behind the other books.
ã
Belle_018_f|It's a rather <ActivityItem>Mysterious Book</ActivityItem> written in letters I've never seen before. I wonder what it says.
?
Belle_019_f0Could be the first chapter of a new adventure...
-
Belle_020_fThat's what I was hoping, too!

Belle_021_fpI'm going to try and decipher this <ActivityItem>Mysterious Book</ActivityItem>. I have to know what it's about!

Belle_044_f?Oh, I'm sure the other Villagers know how much you do for them.
j
Belle_059_f[That was the right shelf! I'd say we're quite the team. Everything worked on the first try.
N
Belle_049_f?Hmm... I'm not sure about this, but I suppose it's worth a try.
o
Belle_053_f`As soon as I put it on the shelf, the book came back to me. We'll have to choose something else.
