Belle_000_fXLet's start the <ActivityItem>Translation Machine</ActivityItem> and see what happens...

Belle_053_f...
e
Belle_002_fV{PlayerName}, this is amazing! I never thought Papa's invention could really be built!
}
Belle_003_fnThe <ActivityItem>Translation Machine</ActivityItem> Ã¢Â€Â” it's like it's talking to me. Asking me questions.
&
Belle_004_fWhat kind of questions?
[
Belle_005_fLWell, right now it's asking me, "the name of the bravest horse of them all."
=
Belle_012_f.Well, let's answer this and see where it goes.
<
Player_000_f,So, the bravest horse of them all must be...
&
Player_000_choice_000_f...Maximus.
'
Player_000_choice_001_f...Philippe.
%
Player_000_choice_002_f
...Samson.
j
Belle_006_f[Maximus... That sounds like the name of a general. Let's see what the machine thinks of it.

Belle_001_f...
=
Belle_038_f.The machine is just asking the question again.
b
Belle_013_fSIt's just asking the same question again. That must not have been the right answer.
i
Belle_007_fZYou mean MY horse? Well... he did come get me to help my father once. That was very brave.
6
Belle_056_f'That must be it. Let's see what's next.
k
Belle_017_f\Now it's asking about, "the perfect time to learn about someone's real identity in a story."
R
Player_001_fBThe right moment in a book to learn about someone's true identity?
A
Player_001_choice_000_f&Everybody knows it's during Chapter 3.
:
Player_001_choice_001_fAt the moment of tragic demise.
,
Player_001_choice_002_fRight at the end.
4
Belle_009_f%And then he showed me where Papa was.
,
Belle_010_fThat's how I met the Beast...
5
Belle_014_f&Let's see if that's the proper answer.

Belle_045_f...
C
Belle_015_f4It worked! It translated a small part of a sentence.
_
Belle_016_fPThe <ActivityItem>Mysterious Book's</ActivityItem> first two words are "I am"...
N
Belle_054_f?{PlayerName}, that question was related to me. How can that be?
p
Belle_055_faI'm not sure. Maybe the magic here is affecting the machine. And since you're the one using it...
`
Belle_018_fQWell, that is where it happens in my favorite book. I hope it's the right answer.

Belle_047_f...
l
Belle_023_f]It was right! It printed two more words. "Dreamlight Valley's." "I am Dreamlight Valley's"...
.
Belle_024_fI wonder what comes after that.
*
Belle_025_fIs there another question?!
4
Belle_026_f%Yes, and hopefully it's the last one.
.
Belle_027_fAll right, what's the question?
p
Belle_028_faIt wants to know "which object a majordomo would be turned into if under an Enchantress's spell."
K
Player_002_f;A majordomo under an Enchantress's spell would turn into...
'
Player_002_choice_000_f...a teapot!
7
Player_002_choice_001_f...a candelabra... for sure.
1
Player_002_choice_002_f...a clock, of course.
$
Belle_029_fNot in my experience.
$
Belle_033_fBut if you're sure...

Belle_052_f...
,
Belle_032_fI'm afraid that wasn't right.
z
Belle_044_fkIt doesn't look like that's the answer the <ActivityItem>Translation Machine</ActivityItem> is looking for.
G
Belle_030_f8That wouldn't have been my answer, but you seem certain.

Belle_051_f...
l
Belle_031_f]That's what I think, too. I hope the <ActivityItem>Translation Machine</ActivityItem> agrees.

Belle_050_f...
F
Belle_034_f7That's it! We did it, {PlayerName}. It's translating...
j
Belle_035_f[I can read the entire first sentence Ã¢Â€Â” "I am Dreamlight Valley's best mystery solver."

Belle_036_fpAnother mystery. I can't wait to read more. Let's let the <ActivityItem>Translation Machine</ActivityItem> work.
—
Belle_037_f‡Thank you for all your help, {PlayerName}. I'll tell you as soon as I've read this entire <ActivityItem>Mysterious Book</ActivityItem>.
\
Belle_019_fMThat would be very sad, {PlayerName}. But I suppose some books are like that.

Belle_048_f...
V
Belle_022_fGIt keeps asking the same question. We must have the wrong answer again.
d
Belle_040_fUI'm actually a little relieved. It would be too sad if lots of stories were that way.
R
Belle_039_fCIt didn't translate anything new. I think we have the wrong answer.
‹
Belle_020_f|I'd be surprised if that was the answer. Usually authors want the characters to spend time together after such a revelation.
l
Belle_021_f]But let's check the <ActivityItem>Translation Machine</ActivityItem> and see if you're right.

Belle_049_f...
V
Belle_041_fGIt keeps asking the same question. We must have the wrong answer again.
(
Belle_043_fLet's try something else.
R
Belle_042_fCIt didn't translate anything new. I think we have the wrong answer.
3
Belle_008_f$That does sound like a strong horse.

Belle_011_fLet's see if it works.
