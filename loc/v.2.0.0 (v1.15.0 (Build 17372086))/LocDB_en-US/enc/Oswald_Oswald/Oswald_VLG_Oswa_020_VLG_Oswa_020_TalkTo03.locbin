:
Player_000_choice_002_fI'm feeling kinda sleepy now...
Z
Oswald_003_fJIt worked like a charm. All the clock tots are snoozin' off to dream land!

Oswald_004_fPerfect!
2
Oswald_005_f"Okey-dokey then, I'll be off√¢¬Ä¬î
G
Oswald_006_f7No, no, you wait here √¢¬Ä¬î we have things to discuss!

Oswald_007_fUh... We do?
k
Oswald_008_f[Your alarm clocks woke up a bunch of people. We can't just leave them to be sleep deprived!
/
Oswald_009_fGee, when ya put it that way...
M
Player_002_choice_000_f2Let me tell you which poor Villagers got woken up.
O
Player_002_choice_001_f4The Villagers are wandering around like zombies now!
j
Oswald_001_fZI saw Merlin looking so sleepy that he thought a capybara challenged him to a wizard duel!
G
Oswald_014_f7We woke folks up, so let's bring 'em each a cup o' joe!
&
Player_001_choice_000_fGreat idea!
:
Player_001_choice_001_fWhat if they don't like coffee?
y
Oswald_021_fiGaston actually said he was too tired for five dozen eggs and only ate four dozen when he went to Remy's.
K
Oswald_022_f;Scrooge McDuck thought he was back in Glasgow for a moment!
x
Oswald_023_fhAnd don't get me started on Rapunzel √¢¬Ä¬î she mixed blue and yellow paint together to try and get red!
/
Oswald_024_fYikes, that does sound serious!
2
Oswald_010_f"Yeah, we're doing an apology tour.
=
Oswald_011_f-Buckle up, Oswald; we need to go make amends.

Oswald_012_f
Any ideas?
I
Oswald_013_f9Lemme just get the ol' wheels turnin'... Hmm... I got it!
o
Oswald_015_f_I've got my own secret recipe for <ActivityItem>Strong Black (and White) Coffee</ActivityItem>.
ù
Oswald_017_fåBut I'll need some <ActivityItem>Coal<ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Pearls</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Oswaldian Garlic</ActivityItem>!
@
Player_003_choice_000_f%Coal, pearls, and garlic for coffee?!
T
Player_003_choice_001_f9I'm learning not to ask questions when it comes to you...
5
Oswald_018_f%None of those are COFFEE Ingredients.
[
Oswald_027_fKThe coal's to get it nice and roasty, and the pearls are for servin' it up.
q
Oswald_028_faSeems like there might be an easier way, but I'll go with you. Wait √¢¬Ä¬î what about the garlic?
j
Oswald_029_fZIt's gotta be black and white, right? The coal is black and the garlic's white. Naturally!
?
Oswald_019_f/Why don't you just use milk for the white part?
à
Oswald_030_fxAw, everybody knows milk in coffee just makes it brown. But garlic √¢¬Ä¬î that floats around for that nice dappled look!
^
Oswald_020_fNOK, I get you. This doesn't make regular-sense, but it does make Oswald-sense.

Oswald_031_f#I'll be back soon with the coffees!
)
Oswald_032_fGreat! Here's the garlic!
*
Oswald_000_fIt'll be aces; you'll see!
W
Oswald_026_fGMy <ActivityItem>Black (and White) Coffee</ActivityItem> can't be beat!
O
Oswald_016_f?Oh, my coffee'll turn any tea-sipper into a cup o' joe chugger!
B
Oswald_025_f2Maybe they're just goin' for some restful strolls?
