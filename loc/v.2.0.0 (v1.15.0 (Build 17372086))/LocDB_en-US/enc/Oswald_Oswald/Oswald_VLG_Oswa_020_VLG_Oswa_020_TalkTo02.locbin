Olaf_004_f#That happened to me! It's very fun.
‚

Olaf_005_ftAt first, yes, but they're starting to become something of a hassle. They've been running wild and waking people up.
B

Olaf_006_f4But I was thinking... could you help them calm down?


Olaf_007_fqWe need them to take it down a notch and only get excited in the morning when they're supposed to wake Oswald up.

Olaf_008_fJAre you saying that I should tell a story to an audience of alarm clocks?!
Q

Olaf_009_fCWow... I've never had an audience like that before... I can't wait!
