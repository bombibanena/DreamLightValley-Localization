,
Minnie_002_fCertainly! I'd love to help.
-
Minnie_003_fWhat seems to be the trouble?
m
Minnie_004_f]Well, Jack and Sally have spent a lot of time apart and need something to connect them again.
m
Minnie_005_f]I'm trying to help them plan a fun date, but well... those two aren't your typical romantics.
F
Minnie_006_f6Yes, I see what you mean. Let me think for a moment...
#

y
Minnie_008_fiMickey and I always feel close when we share an experience. What if you make them a tasty treat to share?
g
Minnie_009_fWI have a lovely recipe for <Lore>Gingerbread Cookies</Lore> that you're welcome to use.
n
Minnie_011_f^Daisy gave me similar advice. She suggested that I make something in a Halloween-themed shape.
j
Minnie_012_fZI think getting some more Halloween-themed foods and arranging a picnic should be perfect!
‚
Minnie_013_frOh, they'll love it! And, you know, some <ActivityItem>Candy Apples</ActivityItem> would go wonderfully with that.
Á
Minnie_016_f°Ooo! I have one last idea! If you really want to make the date special, you can have Sally and Jack <Lore>gather by the Holiday Tree Portal</Lore> that Jack first came through!
Y
Minnie_014_fIThanks, Minnie. I'm going to ask Daisy too, but this is excellent advice.

Minnie_015_fI'm always happy to help!
