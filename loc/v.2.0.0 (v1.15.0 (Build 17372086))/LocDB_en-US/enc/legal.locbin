<size=140%>5 √¢¬Ä¬ì How we share your information</size>

With Gameloft entities

In order to operate the Services, your personal information may be transferred to other Gameloft studios or entities, subsidiaries, processors or third parties located worldwide as described below (please refer to "International operations and transfers of your information").

With third parties

We use third-party services that have limited access to your information for specific purposes, such as administration, analytics, optimization, advertising, prize delivery, marketing assistance, customer service, and data analysis. They assist us with our operations. 
Such third parties are authorized to use your information for these purposes only.

If you decide, while using our Services, to use social sharing features such as √¢¬Ä¬úShare√¢¬Ä¬ù or √¢¬Ä¬úLike√¢¬Ä¬ù on Facebook or other third-party social network sites, this may allow the sharing and collection of personal and non-personal information both to and from such third-party social networks.
You should visit the policies of such third parties for more information about their information collection practices.

Since Gameloft is part of the Vivendi Group, your information may be transferred to Vivendi entities for global projects. In that case, you will be informed of the nature of the relevant projects and the entities involved, and you will be asked for your prior consent before any transfer of your information takes place.

With authorities

We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agency activities that we, in good faith, believe to be illegal. We will investigate or take action to counter illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Services, or to protect the property or safety of others. We may also disclose your information if required by any law or court order worldwide, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct.
In that case, we will consider applicable local laws, the nature of the order, as well as the legitimacy and proportionality of your information.

In case of sale of our company

In connection with any sale of our company or any line of business (including the assets relating thereto), customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of any such sale or disposition of any or all of our business, your information may be transferred to the acquirer.

<size=140%>6 √¢¬Ä¬ì International operations and transfers of your information</size>

As part of our international operations, we may transfer personal information to our affiliates (which means subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, and other corporate entities under common ownership of Gameloft S.E) from time to time for our legitimate business purposes.

Gameloft is headquartered in France, and we have operations, entities and Services provided in Canada, the United States and throughout the world. We have taken measures to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and lawfully, and that it will receive an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

<size=140%>7 √¢¬Ä¬ì Security and confidentiality of your personal information</size>

We have implemented security measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the personal information collected through the Services. 
We take, and force applicable third parties to take, reasonable precautions to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use of, or access to, your information that is under our control. 
When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information or credit card information, we take reasonable steps to ensure that they comply with this Privacy Policy and otherwise protect your personal information (including any credit card information).

If there is a breach of security involving your personal information, including credit card information, from our Services, we will inform you immediately according to your local regulations relating to the notification of information Breaches, and take commercially reasonable steps to rectify such breach.

If you believe your personal information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at DataProtectionSupport@gameloft.com.

<size=140%>8 √¢¬Ä¬ì Children</size>

We encourage parents and guardians to teach their children about privacy and how their information may be used on the Internet. Children should never disclose their name, address or phone number, or any personal information, without their parents√¢¬Ä¬ô or guardian's prior permission.

We consider a user to be a child if they are under the age of 13, unless more stringent regulation applies in their state of residence.

If we consider that any of our Services are directed at users under the minimum legal age required in their country of residence, we can block such users from using the Services or from providing information and/or limit the collection of information from such users as described below in more detail.

No personal information should be submitted to Gameloft by users under the minimum legal age required in their state of residence. We apply the following limitations to personal information collection for a user that is not of the minimum legal age required in their state of residence.

Such a user cannot:

<indent=5%>- display their real name or any information in the games</indent>

<indent=5%>- access the chat, leaderboard, forums, SNS (Facebook, Game Center, etc.)</indent>

<indent=5%>- subscribe to newsletters</indent>

<indent=5%>- use any other feature where users could appear under their real names</indent>

With respect to such a user, we will prevent the collection and use of their precise geolocation data and display to them contextual advertising only (excluding any behavioral advertising).

Children can be invited to take part in testing our games (playtests) with their parents' or guardians√¢¬Ä¬ô authorization and/or their parents' or guardians√¢¬Ä¬ô physical presence being required depending on the state where the playtest is conducted.

Parents must exercise their privacy rights for their children. Please refer to the "Your rights" section of this Privacy Policy.

<size=140%>11 √¢¬Ä¬ì Additional information for Californian users</size>

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) permits California residents to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information about the types of personal information the business has collected, shared with, and/or sold to third parties for a business or commercial purpose during the immediately preceding calendar year.

As a Californian consumer, you also have the right, at any time, to opt out of any type of selling of your personal information.

Please note that (other than in the two situations described immediately below) we do not sell your personal information to provide the game or game services described in this Privacy Policy. Our partners and providers who work with us may have access to your personal information in order to provide you with the game services within the limits and throughout the duration of our agreement, but they can√¢¬Ä¬ôt reuse your personal information for any other purposes. Our contracts are strictly drafted to protect your personal information and your privacy rights.

Exceptions

1) Gameloft is part of the Vivendi Group and we may sell your data for use in specific partnerships with Vivendi and other Vivendi entities.

We will only sell the personal information of users who are 16 years of age or older, and you can opt out at any time by using this form (https://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice/contact-form-us).

As we do not sell the personal information of users who are less than 16 years old, only users who are 16 years old or older may opt out.

A person legally authorized to act on behalf of a user has the right to opt out for that user. We only provide this right to users who are 16 years of age or older, and we may ask them for a copy of an identifying document.

If you submit a request on behalf of another person, we may require a proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from them.

In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another person. Additionally, we will not honor your request when an exception applies, such as when the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another consumer or when the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA√¢¬Ä¬ôs access or deletion rights.

The exercise of any of the rights mentioned above will not have any discriminatory consequences for you.

To exercise your rights, please access this form (https://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice/contact-form-us) or refer to the √¢¬Ä¬úHow to contact us√¢¬Ä¬ù section of this Privacy Policy.

Gameloft ("we", "our" or "us") operates the Gameloft website (the "Site"), provides various apps, games and social networks (the "Apps"), and offers certain other features, content, or contests from time to time (collectively, "Additional Features") (the Site, Apps, and Additional Features shall hereinafter sometimes be collectively referred to as the "Services"). 

These Terms of Use ("Agreement") include our policy for acceptable use of the Services and govern your rights, obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the Services. You are only authorised to use the Services if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and this Agreement. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. 

Because your privacy is important to us, this Agreement also incorporates, by this reference, our Privacy Policy (http://www.gameloft.com/privacy-notice), which explains how we collect and use your content and information. Please read the Privacy Policy. 

Your access and use of the Services constitutes your representation and warranty that you are of legal age to form a binding contract, and if not of legal age, that you access and use the Services with the permission of a parent or legal guardian, and that you are not a person barred from using or receiving the Services by any local, state, federal or international law. 

In order to participate in certain Services, you may be notified that you are required to agree to additional terms and conditions, and such additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by this reference, but such additional terms and conditions shall control solely for the applicable Service. 

<size=120%>I. YOUR ACCOUNT / PASSWORD SECURITY / SUSPENSION, TERMINATION </size>

When you access the Apps for the first time, you may be asked to indicate your age. Please consider we need it to tailor your experience in-game. We may therefore apply some age restrictions to our Apps and you agree and acknowledge that some of our Apps require you to be thirteen (13) years of age and above.

In order to benefit from some features of the Services, you may be required to register an account (an "Account"). When creating or updating an Account, you are required to provide us with certain personal information, which may include your name, date of birth, email address, and, in some cases, payment information. This information will be held and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy at http://www.gameloft.com/privacy-notice. 

You may never use another's Account without permission. You are prohibited from registering a new Account if you have previously had an Account terminated. 

You are responsible for (i) keeping confidential any password that you created to use any aspect of the Services requiring registration, and (ii) restricting access to your computer, console, or mobile device. You agree to accept full responsibility for all activities that occur within your Account. You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your Account. 

Although we will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorised use of your Account, whether with or without your knowledge, you may be liable for our losses or the losses of our third-party licensors, content providers, merchants, advertisers, sponsors, and service providers (collectively, "Gameloft Providers") due to such unauthorised use. 

Without limiting anything in this Agreement, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate your Account and/or your access to any or all parts of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without liability, including in the event we stop offering any aspect of the Services. We expressly reserve the right to restrict, suspend and/or terminate your access to any part of the Services if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated any of the terms of this Agreement.

<size=120%>II. PURCHASES / PAYMENTS / REFUNDS </size>

We may charge fees associated with certain Services, including, without limitation, for subscriptions, the download of Apps, and the purchase of Virtual Items (as defined below). Such products or services will be made available for purchase on specified pages of the Site, within the Apps, on Gameloft Providers√¢¬Ä¬ô websites or platforms (including third-party marketplaces), or otherwise as indicated through the Services. In the event of any fee changes by Gameloft, Gameloft will provide you with commercially reasonable notice of such charge. 

The price of any product or service purchased through the Services will be the price specified at the time of your purchase. Prices for all products and services exclude all applicable taxes and telecommunication charges, unless otherwise indicated. To the extent permissible by law, you agree to be responsible for any such applicable taxes and telecommunication charges. 

Your purchase of any App, Virtual Item or other content through the Services constitutes your representation and warranty that you are of legal age to form a binding contract, and if not of legal age, that you have placed such order with the permission of a parent or legal guardian, and that you are not a person barred from using or receiving the Services by any local, state, federal or international law. 

When you provide credit card information to us, you represent that you are the authorised user of the credit card that is used to pay the subscription or other fees. If you order a subscription, each month that you use the Services, you agree and reaffirm that we are authorised to charge your credit card for the subscription fee. You agree to promptly notify us of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, and you agree to promptly notify us if your credit card expires or is cancelled for any reason. We reserve the right to collect applicable taxes for certain Services. We will notify you of any modification of applicable fees by the means described in section VIII below. You will have ten business days to terminate your subscription plan or applicable Service following this notification. In the event that you do not terminate your access to the Service within this timeframe, the new applicable fees will apply to your subscription plan or applicable Service. 

When you are using our Services through a carrier (e.g. mobile service plan, preloaded games, subscriptions), message and data rates may apply, depending on the terms of your individual mobile service plan. Gameloft fees for one-time purchase of games or subscriptions may vary depending on your carrier, your country of residence and the game you select. These charges are billed to your mobile phone bill or will be deducted from your prepaid balance. They will appear under "Gameloft" on your mobile phone bill.

Apps, Additional Features and Virtual Items can be downloaded in connection with the Services for a charge. We assume no liability for purchaser error; trial versions; software purchased for the wrong telephone, device or platform; promotional codes or discounts not provided at the time of purchase ("Purchaser Errors"). We will not be liable for any errors on billing statements issued to you by your carrier or the Gameloft Providers√¢¬Ä¬ô websites or platforms (including third-party marketplaces). You accept full responsibility for confirming that the phone or other device manufacturer, phone or other device model, and carrier are supported and that the phone or other device is compatible with the products or services purchased, downloaded or otherwise obtained by you through the Services. If you have other questions in connection with any product or service available through the Services, please contact the Gameloft technical team at http://support.gameloft.com/. Please read the system requirements very carefully before making any purchases. 

Right of cancellation: If you choose to cancel your order, you may do so within 14 days from when you received your receipt without giving any reason. To cancel your order, you must inform us of your decision via a declaration by mentioning the reference of the purchase, the date of the purchase, your name and your address, sent via our Customer Care portal at http://support.gameloft.com/. To meet the cancellation deadline, you must send your communication of cancellation before the 14-day period has expired. If you choose to cancel your monthly subscription, you may do so pursuant to the terms.

Effects of cancellation: We will reimburse you no later than 14 days from the day on which we receive your cancellation notice. We will use the same means of payment as you used for the transaction, and you will not incur any fees for such reimbursement. 

Exception to the right of cancellation: You cannot cancel your order for the supply of digital content if the delivery has started upon your request and acknowledgement that you thereby lose your cancellation right. 

CERTAIN APPS ALLOW YOU TO PURCHASE VIRTUAL ITEMS (AS DEFINED BELOW) WITHIN THE APP. SUCH PURCHASES MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE IN BOTH APPS WHICH YOU MUST PURCHASE TO DOWNLOAD AS WELL AS APPS WHICH ARE FREE TO DOWNLOAD. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN APPS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE FREE TO DOWNLOAD, MAY CONTAIN THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS THAT MAY REDIRECT YOU TO A THIRD-PARTY SITE.

<size=120%>III. VIRTUAL ITEMS </size>

Certain Services may allow you to "earn" or "purchase" (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual coins, cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Services; (b) virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency); or (c) certain in-game benefits ("Virtual Items"). Virtual Items have no real-world value and cannot be redeemed for actual currency, goods or other items of monetary value, including in the event that you have unused Virtual Items remaining in your account at the time your account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or not. All sales of Virtual Items are final. Aside from the right of cancellation described in section II above and to the extent permitted by law, no refunds will be given, except in our sole and absolute discretion. 

The purchase of any Virtual Item is merely the purchase of a licence to use the Virtual Item in the applicable Services and does not transfer ownership of that Virtual Item to you. This licence is personal to you and cannot be sold, transferred, assigned, gifted, traded or sublicensed. Accordingly, we expressly prohibit and do not recognise any purported sales, transfers, assignments, gifts, trades or sublicences of Virtual Items, whether for "real money," goods or any other exchange outside of the Services. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and may subject you to a termination of your account, a lifetime ban from our products and services, and even legal action. 

<size=120%>IV. ONLINE CONDUCT </size>

You, as a user, agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes. Specific prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: 

1. criminal or tortious activity, including child pornography, fraud, trafficking in obscene material, drug dealing, gambling, harassment, stalking, spamming, spimming, sending of viruses or other harmful files, copyright infringement, patent infringement, or theft of trade secrets; 

2. promoting illegal or tortious activities or conduct that is abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory or libellous; 

3. using photos and/or pictures that are sexually explicit or pornographic, exposing the female breast or full exposure of either male or female buttocks, or any or all portions of the human genitalia; exposing anyone or anything involved in explicit sexual acts and/or lewd and lascivious behaviour, including masturbation, copulation, paedophilia, intimacy involving nude or partially nude people in heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, or homosexual encounters; depicting anyone or anything that is crudely vulgar or grossly deficient in civility or behaviour or that shows scatological impropriety and any other content contravening good moral standards; 

4. attempting to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Services or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Services or the content therein; 

5. using cheats, exploits, automation software, bots, hacks, mods or any other unauthorised software designed to modify or interfere with the Services, and taking advantage of cheats or exploits; 

6. using any software that intercepts, mines, or otherwise collects information about other users or copies and stores any Proprietary Materials (as defined below); 

7. interfering with, disrupting, or creating an undue burden on the Services or the networks or services connected to the Services; 

8. attempting to impersonate another user or person; 

9. soliciting personal information from anyone under 18; 

10. collecting, harvesting, soliciting or posting passwords or personally identifiable information from other users; 

11. using the account, username, or password of another account holder at any time or disclosing your password to any third party or permitting any third party to access your Account; 

12. using any information obtained from the Services in order to harass, abuse, or harm another person; 

13. using any unfair, misleading or deceptive content intended to draw traffic to one√¢¬Ä¬ôs profile; 

14. using the Services in a manner inconsistent with any and all applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. export and re-export control laws and regulations; 

15. sublicensing, renting, leasing, selling, trading, gifting, bequeathing or otherwise transferring your account or any Virtual Items associated with your account to anyone; 

16. accessing or using a third-party account or any Virtual Items that have been sublicensed, rented, leased, sold, traded, gifted, bequeathed, or otherwise transferred from the holder or the original account creator; 

17. using multiple accounts, manual procedures, bots, scripts or other processes in order to accumulate or "farm" Virtual Items, or for any other purpose prohibited under this Agreement; 

18. using the Services in a commercial manner, including the transferring of Virtual Items in exchange for "real-world" money; 

19. making any automated use of the Services (playing more than 24 hours in a row is considered as automated use) or taking any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.

You will immediately be banned from the Services if you are found to be participating in any one of these activities. Any conduct by you in violation of the foregoing prohibitions may result in the suspension or termination of your Account and your access to the Services.

<size=120%>V. CONTENT </size>

A. Proprietary Rights 

With the exception of content posted by users of the Services ("User Content"), all materials contained on the Services, including all content, the Virtual Items and the software, graphics, text and look and feel of the sites, and all trademarks (including GAMELOFT√Ç¬Æ and the titles of all of our Apps), copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights related thereto ("Proprietary Materials"), are owned or controlled by Gameloft, our subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our third-party licensors, and/or our advertising partners. You may not modify, remove, delete, augment, add to, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, or in any way exploit any Proprietary Materials, or any other protectable aspects of the Services, in whole or in part. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and any other relevant policies related to the Services, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited licence subject to the limitations herein to access and use the Services and Proprietary Materials for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes consistent with the intended purpose of the Services. You agree not to use the Service for any other purpose. 

As referenced above, even though you may buy Virtual Items with "real-world" money, you do not, in fact, "own" such items. By making such a purchase, you are merely being granted a licence to use such Virtual Items in the applicable Apps or other Services for which such Virtual Items can be used. The Virtual Items have no real-world value and are not in any way a credit or balance of real currency or its equivalent. In no event can any Virtual Items be redeemed for actual, "real-world" currency. We have the sole and absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Items as we see fit in our sole discretion, and shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. 

B. Distribution/Uploading of Content 

You are prohibited from posting on or transmitting through the Services (e.g., through uploaded content, a chat or user forum, online review or comment posted through the Services) any content that infringes upon a third party√¢¬Ä¬ôs intellectual property rights or is defamatory, damaging, illegal, or offensive. 

Without limiting the foregoing, you may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way on the Services any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information belonging to others unless you have first obtained the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights. It is our policy to terminate the account of anyone who repeatedly infringes the copyright rights of others upon our receipt of proper notification from the copyright owner or the copyright owner√¢¬Ä¬ôs legal agent. 

By submitting content or materials ("Your Content") to us through the Services, including, without limitation, uploading any materials, choosing a username, or participation in any chats or forums, you automatically grant us, or warrant that the owner of such content has expressly granted us, the royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable, non-exclusive right and licence to use, reproduce, publish, translate, prepare derivative works of, copy, perform and distribute Your Content, including all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such content, and your username, actual name, and likeness (if submitted), in whole or in part worldwide, including in connection with announcing you as the winner of a sweepstakes/contest or including you in leaderboards. You also hereby grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive licence to access Your Content through the Services, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform Your Content as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under this Agreement. The above licences granted by you in Your Content are perpetual and will only terminate if you've requested the removal or deletion of Your Content from the Services (such licence will terminate within a commercially reasonable time after your request to remove or delete Your Content). You understand and agree, however, that we may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of Your Content that have been removed or deleted. The foregoing is subject to the provision regarding Unsolicited Submissions below. 

Subject to these grants, you retain any and all rights which may exist in Your Content. 

We may disclose any of Your Content or electronic communications of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate our Services; (iii) to protect the rights or property of Gameloft and our officers, directors, employees and agents; or (iv) to protect Gameloft Providers and any other users. 

C. Advertising 

By using our Site/Apps, you may be offered advertising content. As such, you warrant that you agree with our Privacy Policy in relation to advertising. For more information, please refer to http://www.gameloft.com/privacy-notice/. 

Gameloft is not responsible for the third-party products or services displayed therein. 

D. Representations and Warranties 

You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licences, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorise us to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all of Your Content and to enable inclusion and use of Your Content in the manner contemplated by the Services and this Agreement. You further represent and warrant Your Content will not defame any third party and that the use of Your Content on the Services will not violate or infringe upon the intellectual property rights, or the rights of privacy or publicity, of any third party. 

E. Third-Party Content & User Content 

You acknowledge that Gameloft is an online service provider that may post content supplied by third parties and users. We have no more editorial control over the content posted by such third parties (including User Content) than does a public library or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, judgments, services, offers, or other information that constitutes part of the content expressed or made available by third parties, including User Content, are those of the respective authors or distributors and not of Gameloft or its affiliates or any of their officers, directors, employees, or agents. While we retain the right to filter or reject User Content and other content posted by third parties, we review User Content and other third-party content in a limited gate-keeper fashion and have no obligation to investigate whether any User Content and other third-party content violate any term of this Agreement and will not do so in most cases. We neither endorse nor are responsible for the User Content or any other content posted to the Services by anyone other than Gameloft.

Just as you retain complete ownership of Your Content (subject to the licence to us granted above), all other users of the Services retain ownership of their User Content. You may not modify, remove, delete, augment, add to, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, or in any way exploit any User Content in whole or in part. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all Gameloft games under Disney licence (e.g.: Disney Dreamlight Valley), to the extent that Gameloft authorises you to create, use, post, upload, distribute, publicly display or publicly perform User Content that requires the use of Gameloft or Disney copyrighted works, Gameloft and Disney grant you a non-exclusive licence to create a derivative work using the specifically referenced copyrighted works as required for the sole purpose of creating such a work, provided that such licence shall be conditioned upon your assignment to Disney of all rights worldwide of the work you create for the duration of copyright of the User Content, in all formats and media known or unknown to date. If such rights are not assigned to Disney, your licence to create derivative works using Gameloft and Disney copyrighted works shall be null and void.

F. Unsolicited Submissions 

We are pleased to hear from our customers and welcome their comments regarding our Services. Unfortunately, however, long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as game ideas or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials.

G. Non-fungible Tokens 

Only limited personal, non-commercial use of, and resale rights of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are granted and you have no right to licence, commercially exploit, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, publicly perform, or publicly display an NFT, or the music or the artwork therein. You have no right to modify and/or use the art to market or sell any products. All copyrights and other rights are reserved and not granted.

Gameloft is not responsible for the blockchain network and/or any other third-party service that you might access or use for the purpose of using, owning, or transferring the Non-fungible Tokens, and you warrant that you will hold Gameloft harmless from any and all claims of any nature that in any way arise from your use of any third-party service and/or platform.

In the case of resale of the NFT according to the conditions authorised above, no transfer of rights whatsoever will be granted, and the new owner will be subject to the same limitations.

<size=120%>VI. NOTICE OF INFRINGEMENT </size>

Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that any content, including User Content, or other materials, posted on the Services constitutes an infringement of your copyrights or trademarks, we will respond promptly to any properly submitted notice containing the information detailed below. Please send all notices to the following email address: legal@gameloft.com.

Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted; 5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorised to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 

<size=120%>VII. NON-COMMERCIAL USE </size>

We do not monitor or control the linked sites and make no representations regarding, and are not liable or responsible for the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability or availability of, any of the content uploaded, displayed, or distributed, or products, or services available at these sites. If you choose to access any third-party site, you do so at your own risk. The presence of a link to a third-party site does not constitute or imply our endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party or of the content, products, or services contained on, or available through, the third-party site. 

We reserve the right to disable links from or to third-party sites.

<size=120%>X. THIRD-PARTY MERCHANTS / PROVIDERS </size>

The Services may enable you to order and receive products, information and services from businesses that are not owned or operated by us. The purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery, maintenance, and all other matters concerning the merchandise, services or information, opinion or advice ordered or received from such businesses are solely between you and such businesses. We do not endorse, warrant, or guarantee such products, information, or services, and are not liable for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such information or the quality or availability of such products or services. We will not be a party to or in any way be responsible for monitoring any transaction between you and third-party providers of such products, services, or information, or for ensuring the confidentiality of your credit card information. Any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility and are not part of the fee, if any, charged for the Services. 

In addition, the Services may prompt you to establish an account with a third-party service provider not owned or operated by us. Your agreement and understanding with any such third-party service provider is solely between you and such service provider. We will not be a party to, or in any way be responsible for, your agreement with such third-party service provider. Any disputes you may encounter with such third-party service provider shall be settled solely between you and the service provider. 

<size=120%>XI. DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY </size>

When you consult Gameloft Services, cookies and other tracking devices are placed on your Terminal.

This page gives you a better understanding of how cookies on our Services work and how to use the various tools available to set (accept or reject) them.

Your installation and/or use of these Services and/or submission of information to us constitute your consent to this Cookies Policy and the processing of your personal information. This Cookies Policy is effective as of April 1, 2020.

<size=140%>Introduction</size>

This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how Gameloft and its subsidiaries use cookies on their websites and their mobile apps and what you can do to manage how cookies are used.

We are committed to protecting the personal information we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps and other services. We are informing you in a transparent way about our policy regarding the deposit and use of cookies from our sites to your connection terminal.

<size=140%>What is a cookie?</size>

Cookies are tiny text files sent to your device browser or application by a server, which are then stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device when you visit certain webpages or apps. They identify your computer or mobile device and may collect and store information√¢¬Ä¬îsuch as behavioral data√¢¬Ä¬îabout your visit to our Services.

Cookies are very useful and allow a website to recognize you, to signal your passage on this or that page, and to provide you with additional services: improving your navigational comfort, securing your connection or adapting the contents of a page to your interests. The information stored by the cookies, which are valid for a limited period of time, relates in particular to the pages visited, the advertisements on which you have clicked, the type of browser you use, and the information you have entered on a site in order to avoid having to enter it again.

Cookies do not contain any personal information but may be associated with the personal information you have provided to us.

In addition, other types of identifiers with an object similar to a cookie may be used by Gameloft, such as the advertising identifier of a smartphone ("GAID", "IDFA", √¢¬Ä¬úAdvertisement ID").

Should you choose to submit personal information to us, we may link cookie information to such personal information. In that case, you can exercise your privacy rights as specified in Gameloft's Privacy Policy. (https://www.gameloft.com/en-gb/privacy-notice)

If you do not accept cookies, or if you delete cookies, you may no longer be able to use a number of features that may be necessary to use our Services. Gameloft cannot be held liable for consequences relating to the degraded or suboptimal functioning of the Services that result from the inability to record or consult cookies.

<size=140%>What types of cookies do we use and for what purposes?</size>

Our websites may use several types of cookies, as listed below. Some of them are mandatory for the proper functioning of websites you access. When the use of a cookie requires your explicit prior consent, you will be directly informed through a banner on the website you want to access. You will also have the ability to withdraw your consent at any time.

<size=140%>How long are they stored?</size>

The cookies are not stored for longer than 13 months.

<size=140%>Which companies send cookies?</size>

<size=140%>Cookies and other trackers from Gameloft</size>

Gameloft deposits cookies on your Terminal or allows the deposit of external (third party) cookies in order to process data on its behalf. In this case, as the entity responsible for processing the cookies placed when using the Services, viewing videos or clicking on advertising spaces, Gameloft determines the means and purposes of the processing carried out on the data collected using these cookies.

Cookies make it possible to identify your interests through the pages you consult on our Services and we may also personalize advertising offers addressed to you on third-party sites. Please note that ads are not personalized to respect legal requirements for age limits for children in the country where those children live.

<size=140%>Cookies and trackers from partners</size>

<size=140%>Cookies from Vivendi companies</size>

Gameloft, which is part of the Vivendi group, allows the deposit of third-party cookies used by Vivendi group companies such as Dailymotion, Universal Music Group, Editis, Vivendi Ticketing, etc. For an exhaustive and up-to-date list of entities belonging to the Vivendi group, you can consult the website here: https://www.vivendi.com/vivendi/vivendi-en-bref-2/.

Vivendi group cookies may be placed when you browse our Site, view our videos or click on advertising spaces.

They make it possible to identify your interests through the pages consulted on our Site and to personalize advertising offers addressed to you on the other Vivendi group sites, such as CANAL+, Universal Music, Editis, Vivendi Ticketing, etc.

<size=140%>Advertising cookies from advertising partners</size>

Advertising cookies are placed by third-party companies (such as, in particular, advertisers, advertising agencies, communication consulting agencies, audience measurement companies, targeted advertising providers, etc.) in the advertising space on our Site, the use of which contributes to the financing of the content and services that we make available to you free of charge.

These cookies make it possible, first of all, to count the total number of ads displayed in our advertising spaces, to identify these ads, their respective number of displays, the number of users who clicked on each ad and, where applicable, the subsequent actions taken by these users on the pages to which these ads lead, in order to calculate the amounts owed to the actors in the advertising distribution chain (communication agency, advertising network, site/distribution medium) and to establish statistics.

These advertising cookies also make it possible to adapt the advertising content in our advertising spaces that is displayed on your device, based on the navigation performed by your device on our Site, or even, if applicable, based on the location data transmitted by your device (behavioral advertising). This way, you can view the advertisement that we think is best suited to the anonymous profile of how you use your device. These cookies can also limit the number of times you see the same ad on the same medium.

We do not have subsequent control over the cookies deposited by third-party companies that act independently. These cookies are subject to the privacy policies of these third parties. However, if you wish to reject all or part of the cookies, we invite you to follow the tips below.

<size=140%>Social network cookies (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.) generated by √¢¬Ä¬úshare√¢¬Ä¬ù buttons</size>

We may include computer applications from third parties on our Site. These allow you to share content from our Site with third parties. This is the case, for example, for the "Share" and "Like" buttons, which come from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest.

The social network providing a √¢¬Ä¬úshare√¢¬Ä¬ù button is likely to identify you through this function, even if you did not use this button during your consultation. Indeed, this type of button may allow the relevant social network to track your browsing on our Site, simply because your social network account was activated on your device (open session) during your visit.

We have no control over the process used by social networks to collect information about your browsing on our Site and associated with the personal information they hold. We invite you to consult the privacy policies of these social networks to learn about the purposes for which they use the browsing information (including advertising) they may collect through these application buttons and how to disable tracking by them.

<size=140%>How do I accept or reject cookies?</size>

A simple version of this is a tiny clear image that is the size of a pixel. When a webpage with this image loads, it will make a call to a server for the image. This "server call" allows companies to know that someone has loaded the page. Web beacons are useful for advertisers displaying their ads on someone else's website or services that don't have server log access. Often, advertisers will embed web beacons in their advertisements to get an idea of how often an advertisement appears.

settings_privacy_macos_1—9We have agreements with these service providers that permit them to use your information for these purposes only and limit other uses.

<size=120%>4.3 √¢¬Ä¬ì With authorities</size>

We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies certain conduct and activities that we, in good faith, believe to be illegal. We will investigate or take action to counter illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Services, or to protect the property or safety of others. We may also disclose your information if required by any law or court order worldwide, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. In that case, we will consider applicable local laws, the nature of the order, as well as the legitimacy and proportionality of your information.

<size=120%>4.4 √¢¬Ä¬ì In case of sale of our company</size>

In connection with any sale of our company or any line of business (including the assets relating thereto), customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of any such sale or disposition of any or all of our business, your information may be transferred to the acquirer.

<size=140%>5 √¢¬Ä¬ì International operations and transfers of your information</size>

As part of our international operations, we may transfer personal information to our affiliates (which means subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, and other corporate entities under common ownership of Gameloft SE) from time to time for our legitimate business purposes.

Gameloft is headquartered in France, and we have operations, entities and Services provided in Canada, the United States and throughout the world. We have taken measures to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and lawfully, and that it will receive an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

<size=140%>6 √¢¬Ä¬ì Security and confidentiality of your personal information</size>

We have implemented security measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the personal information collected through the Services. We take, and force applicable third parties to take, reasonable precautions to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use of, or access to, your information that is under our control.√Ç¬†When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information or credit card information, we take reasonable steps to ensure that they comply with this Privacy Policy and otherwise protect your personal information (including any credit card information).

If there is a breach of security involving your personal information, including credit card information, from our Services, we will inform you immediately according to your local regulations relating to the notification of information breaches, and take commercially reasonable steps to rectify such breach.

If you believe your personal information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at√Ç¬†DataProtectionSupport@gameloft.com.

<size=140%>7 √¢¬Ä¬ì Children</size>

The privacy and safety of Children online is paramount to Gameloft. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we generally define a "Child" (or "Children") as a user under the age of 13 in the United States, and under the age of 16 in the EU/EEA (except where applicable law establishes a different age for a Child). We establish whether the user qualifies as a Child using an age-screening mechanism displayed to all users upon launching the Game. We apply the following safeguards to Children:

<indent=5%>- Children only have access to an offline version of the Game. Therefore, Children do not have access to online/cross-save features, and any data listed in this Privacy Policy as pertaining to online/cross-save features is not collected.</indent>
<indent=5%>-We do not perform tracking/analytics operations based on Children's data (including demographic analytics).</indent>

In addition to these measures, we encourage parents and guardians to teach their Children about privacy and how their information may be used online. Children should never disclose their name, address or phone number, or any personal information, without their parents' or guardian's prior permission.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a Child and believe your Child has provided us with personal information, please fill out this form (https://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice/contact-form/?gdpr=1) and we will delete the information from our systems.

To exercise privacy rights on behalf of Children, including access, rectification, or erasure of information, please refer to the "8 √¢¬Ä¬ì Your rights" section of this Privacy Policy.

<size=140%>8 √¢¬Ä¬ì Your rights</size>

<b>Access, Correction, and Deletion Rights</b>. You can ask Gameloft at any time: 

<indent=5%>- to give you access to your information</indent>
<indent=5%>- to correct your information, or</indent>
<indent=5%>- to delete some or all of it</indent>

Please specify your request through this form (https://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice/contact-form/?gdpr=1).√Ç¬†Please note that parents and guardians may also make requests on behalf of their Children. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a Child (as determined by applicable regulations) and believe your Child has provided us with information, please fill out this form and we will delete the information from our system.

Our team will investigate your request and answer you within one (1) month, unless your request requires further investigation. We will inform you if that is the case.

The data deletion process being irreversible, if we delete some or all of your information pursuant to your request, we will no longer use or process the deleted information. Please note that some exclusions may apply, and that some data may be retained in accordance with applicable law or stored to respond to regulatory or law enforcement requests.

<size=140%>9 √¢¬Ä¬ì Additional information for Californian users</size>

<size=120%>F. Unsolicited Submissions</size>

We are pleased to hear from our customers and welcome their comments regarding our Services.

We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as game ideas or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials.

None of the Unsolicited Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Gameloft, and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Unsolicited Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Unsolicited Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Unsolicited Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Unsolicited Submissions.
