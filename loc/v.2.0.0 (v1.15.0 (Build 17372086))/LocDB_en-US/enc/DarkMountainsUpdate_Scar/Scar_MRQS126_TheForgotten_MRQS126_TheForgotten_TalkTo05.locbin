Scar_000_fCAhh... At last. You're the only one here who's not a complete fool.
G
Player_000_choice_000_f,Aw! Thanks! You're not such a fool yourself.

Player_000_choice_001_fI'm not falling for it, Scar.
,
Player_000_choice_002_fWhat do you want?
;

Scar_001_f-I'm humbled by your underwhelming compliment.
;

Scar_005_f-Now then, I've a small question to ask you...
x

Scar_006_fjIt seems to me that those of us who are wise, strong, and cunning should take up the mantle of leadership.
(
Player_001_choice_000_fYes. I agree.
5
Player_001_choice_001_fThat sounds a bit... evil?
@
Player_001_choice_002_f%I don't want to rule over anything...

Scar_007_fOh, you are ever so wise...

Scar_021_f0I'll do it. I'll get that Orb out of the Pillar.
ü

Scar_022_fêI knew you'd see reason. If it were me, I'd start by <Lore>destroying the hideous flowers</Lore> scattered about. I never have cared for them...

Scar_010_fOUnfortunately, there's one minor inconvenience stopping us from assuming power.
M

Scar_011_f?It's that... that monstrosity there, near the end of the river.
>

Scar_012_f0You mean... the Pillar and the Orb of Nurturing?
â

Scar_013_f{Precisely. The windbag with the white mane spends hours examining it, playacting as if he's trying to understand its power.
_

Scar_014_fQBut I'm certain it's there to watch over us. To keep us in our place, as it were.
h

Scar_015_fZI... I guess we could tear the Orb out... like I tore out the one in the Glade of Trust...

Scar_016_f+Precisely. And that's just what I've tried.
∏

Scar_017_f©But it seems to feed off the nature around it. If only someone could injure the flora and fauna √¢¬Ä¬î temporarily, of course √¢¬Ä¬î perhaps you'd be able to destroy it.
z

Scar_008_flUgh. Good, evil... ridiculous distinctions that pompous windbag with the shaggy white mane put in your head.
V

Scar_009_fHOnly because you haven't seen the good I √¢¬Ä¬î er, you √¢¬Ä¬î could do.
U

Scar_002_fGOh, {PlayerName}, you wound me. My intentions are honorable. I promise.
H

Scar_003_f:Manners, {PlayerName}. Churlishness is far from endearing.
