MotherGothel_000_f;Hey, Mother Gothel... you and I need to have a little chat.
f
MotherGothel_001_fPWhat is it, dear? Come to compliment me on my brilliant wit and beguiling charm?
V
MotherGothel_002_f@No. I wanted to talk to you about what you did to the Forgotten.
W
MotherGothel_003_fAOh, this isn't about that little curse, is it? That was ages ago.
I
MotherGothel_004_f3Really, the two of you MUST learn to let things go.

Player_000_choice_000_fWhat you did was not okay.
G
Player_000_choice_001_f,I'm giving you a chance to make this better.
†
MotherGothel_005_fpActually, when you think about it, I was the only one looking out for the Forgotten. I wanted to keep them safe!
:
MotherGothel_014_f$They need a good rhyme for "told"...
^
MotherGothel_015_fHAll right. But first, tell me... why did you come to me with this verse?
R
MotherGothel_016_f<It's about being afraid of getting older, so I thoughtÃ¢Â€Â”
…
MotherGothel_017_foMe? Afraid of something as inconsequential as that. Oh darling, don't be ridiculous. I never give it a thought.
£
MotherGothel_018_fŒYou tell the Forgotten that time passes. But it's how you spend the time that matters! Simply do all that's possible to look after yourself.

MotherGothel_019_fxThere's nothing magical about it. Of course, it does help to be devastatingly charming. After all, charm never gets old.
Q
MotherGothel_020_f;Wait... Mother Gothel... that's it! That's a perfect rhyme!
M
MotherGothel_021_f7<Lore>I've never been one to do what I'm told...</Lore>
S
MotherGothel_022_f=<Lore>I'll care for myself. Charm will never grow old!</Lore>
?
MotherGothel_023_f)... Of course it's perfect. It's from me!

MotherGothel_006_fGNot buying it. But there's one way you can make it up to the Forgotten.

MotherGothel_007_fFine. Tell me what it is.
