Maleficent_002_fWell, what have we here?
K
Maleficent_003_f7Someone foolish enough to barge into my home uninvited?
T
Maleficent_004_f@Do you have even the faintest clue whose wrath you are courting?
P
Player_000_choice_000_f5Soooo, not going to lie. I'm EXTREMELY afraid of you.
Y
Player_000_choice_001_f>Mistress of All Evil... I come to you, humbly, to beg for aid.
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$Cut the threats. You don't scare me.
B
Maleficent_005_f.Good. Then you're not as foolish as I thought.
7
Maleficent_015_f#Tell me what brings you to my home.
;
Player_001_choice_000_f I'm here to stop the Neverafter.
N
Player_001_choice_001_f3I'm here to resolve the feud between you and Hades.
Z
Player_001_choice_002_f?I wanted some style tips. I love your clothes and general vibe.
A
Maleficent_016_f-The Neverafter? Why, whatever could you mean?
-
Player_002_fHelp me solve all this and...
@
Player_002_choice_000_f%...I'll make sure no one bothers you.
;
Player_002_choice_001_f ...we'll put Hades in his place.
=
Player_002_choice_002_f"...I'll be a loyal servant to you.
ê
Maleficent_020_f|Ink bursting out of the ground? The Lorekeeper's pages being scattered? Pieces of your castle showing up all over Everafter?
â
Maleficent_021_fuHow interesting. But that's really none of my concern. There is always something going wrong in this miserable world.
V
Maleficent_017_fBWait... you really don't know what's going on outside your castle?
W
Maleficent_019_fCIt's not that I lack the knowledge. It's that I simply do not care.
9
Maleficent_009_f%For once, it's been mercifully quiet.
5
Maleficent_010_f!No fools trying to steal from me.
@
Maleficent_011_f,No self-righteous wizard, passing judgments.
.
Maleficent_012_fAnd best of all? No Hades.
,
Maleficent_028_fHmm... A tempting offer.
m
Maleficent_049_fYIf you <Lore>set things right in here</Lore>, I'll allow you passage into my throne room.
t
Maleficent_038_f`Got it. <Lore>Clean things up in here, then put my Royal Net to work in your throne room</Lore>!
a
Maleficent_039_fMI look forward to seeing you try. My pets will prove most difficult to catch.
T
Maleficent_040_f@When you fail, I will enjoy keeping you here, as my new servant.
,
Player_003_choice_000_fAnd if I succeed?
,
Player_003_choice_001_fNot gonna happen.
5
Player_003_choice_002_fThat doesn't sound so bad.
i
Maleficent_031_fUI suppose, if you agree to do a little chore for me, and Hades begs my forgiveness...
3
Maleficent_032_f...something could be arranged.
%
Maleficent_033_fWhat's the chore?
V
Maleficent_034_fBI have pets that have gotten loose and brought chaos to my castle.
w
Maleficent_035_fcNow that I consider it, the chaos outside began at almost the same time. Perhaps they're connected.
k
Maleficent_036_fWIn any case, my pets seem to have grown too powerful to be contained, even by MY magic.
h
Maleficent_037_fTI've locked them inside my throne room, but not before they caused havoc everywhere.
f
Maleficent_048_fRThey scattered furniture throughout my castle. And I cannot abide disorganization.

Maleficent_041_f
You won't.
Y
Maleficent_042_fEBut if you do, you will be the rarest thing in this wretched world...
:
Maleficent_043_f&...a mortal who has earned my respect.
l
Maleficent_050_fXBegin by <Lore>finding my missing furniture and placing it back where it belongs</Lore>.
5
Maleficent_044_f!Well then, prove that I am wrong.
U
Maleficent_046_fAIf you do, you will be the rarest thing in this wretched world...
C
Maleficent_045_f/Yes, it would be an honor for you, wouldn't it?
/
Maleficent_047_fBest of luck, {PlayerName}.
8
Maleficent_029_f$Now, that would be quite satisfying.
~
Maleficent_030_fjHmm... I could use a new servant. I seem to have misplaced my most recent one... that fool, Flynn Rider...
J
Maleficent_018_f6Your feud is causing a mess around the Storybook Vale.
1
Maleficent_022_fWhy, whatever could you mean?
+
Maleficent_024_f... Are you mocking me?
2
Maleficent_025_fHuh? No, not at all, I'm√¢¬Ä¬î
p
Maleficent_026_f\I shall grant you one more chance. What REALLY made you fool enough to sneak into my castle?
ã
Maleficent_027_fwOkay, okay. I came here because of the Neverafter and your feud with Hades. You two are causing a mess around the Vale.
}
Maleficent_006_fiOh. You have manners. That might save you from my wrath. But not for long, if you don't explain yourself.
C
Maleficent_007_f/Really? Oh, you are an amusing one, aren't you?
a
Maleficent_008_fMPerhaps I'll keep you as a pet, just like the other one I've imprisoned here.
x
Maleficent_013_fdBut first... tell me, what was so important that you would risk your life by coming here to face me?
