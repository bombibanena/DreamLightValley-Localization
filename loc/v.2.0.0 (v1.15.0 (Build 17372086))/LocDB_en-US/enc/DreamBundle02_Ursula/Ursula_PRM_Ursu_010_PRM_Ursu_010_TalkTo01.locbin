Ursula_020_f'Ugh, and what a waste of time that was.
•
Ursula_025_fîBut now, I'm simply dying to explore the surface of this little Village. I'd have chosen some other form... something closer to my natural beauty...
é
Ursula_027_f~But this was the only potion I had lying around. Good ingredients are almost as hard to find around here as good conversation.

f
Ursula_032_fVHa! But not to worry, {PlayerName}. Right now I couldn't cause trouble if I wanted to.
p
Ursula_011_f`Oh, please. Can't a woman take a simple walk without everyone assuming it's part of some scheme?
v
