Ursula_004_fŸAh, {PlayerName}, there you are. I've thought of a way to continue what we started together. I'm going to make the surface of the Valley far more entertaining.
@
Ursula_005_f0And I need an assistant. Tell me you'll help me.
'
Player_000_choice_000_fYes, always.
,
Player_000_choice_001_fHmm, maybe later.

Ursula_006_f	Fabulous!
e
Ursula_008_fUNow, angelfish, I don't know if you've heard, but we seafolk are superb entertainers.
l
Ursula_009_f\I'd like to show the Villagers what they're missing and put on a performance for the Valley.
Q
Ursula_010_fASomething that'll put Triton's boring little spectacles to shame.
a
Player_001_fQYou could get some Villagers to help you. That would be a good opportunity for...
7
Player_001_choice_000_f...you to make some friends.
A
Player_001_choice_001_f&...the whole Village to come together.
=
Player_001_choice_002_f"...you to show them how it's done.
*
Ursula_011_fHmph. We'll see. Though...
w
Ursula_017_fgI suppose I could use some backup singers to complement my stunning voice. Who do you think would work?
"
Player_003_fWe need someone...
D
Player_003_choice_000_f)...to be your partner in crime for duets.
D
Player_003_choice_001_f)...with a sweet voice for high harmonies.
6
Player_003_choice_002_f...for the lower harmonies.
$
Ursula_020_fMaybe Mother Gothel?
J
Ursula_000_f:Gothel! Ha-ha-ha! I'd love for her to be part of the show.
U
Ursula_024_fEGreat, sounds like that's everyone we'll need! I'll ask them to join.
O
Ursula_025_f?Join? Hardly. No one graces Ursula's stage without an audition.
h
Ursula_028_fXAnd since you're going to be helping me... you should look the part. Here. Put these on.
-
Ursula_029_fI had them made just for you!
M
Ursula_021_f=Maybe Mirabel? Her singing voice would contrast yours nicely!
'
Ursula_023_fYou're right. It would.
r
Ursula_001_fbMaybe Kristoff? He doesn't like to brag, but he's a pretty great singer, and he plays a mean lute!
F
Ursula_002_f6Kristoff... I doubt he'll try to upstage me. He'll do.
7
Ursula_012_f'Ugh, must you always be so sentimental?
‚
Ursula_014_frLast time, you were complaining about being exiled. Wouldn't you like to be part of something now that you can be?
-
Ursula_015_fFine... you may have a point.
-
Ursula_013_fHmm... you do have a point...
m
Ursula_007_f]Fine... but don't take too long. You wouldn't want me to wither away from boredom, would you?
