Ursula_002_f<What does that blonde slip of seagrass have to do with this?
E
Player_001_choice_000_f*You're just suspicious. There's no secret.
8

A
Ursula_005_f1Just tell me what else we need to make the charm.
π
Ursula_006_f®Since you have the petals, it should be simple. <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>... <ActivityItem>Evergems</ActivityItem> that capture the light of the past...
