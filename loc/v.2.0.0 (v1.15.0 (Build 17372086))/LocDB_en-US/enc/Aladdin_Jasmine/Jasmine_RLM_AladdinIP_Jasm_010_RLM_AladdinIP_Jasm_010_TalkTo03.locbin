Jasmine_002_fKOh, that's wonderful! I hope the adjustments you make to your Pickaxe work.
O
Jasmine_003_f>I'm getting rather worried about Aladdin. We need to find him.
R
Jasmine_004_fADo you have any idea what we might run into as we keep searching?

Player_000_choice_001_fI won't be stopped!

Jasmine_008_fAnd neither will I!

Jasmine_009_f9That's all I can ask for. You've already been so helpful.
