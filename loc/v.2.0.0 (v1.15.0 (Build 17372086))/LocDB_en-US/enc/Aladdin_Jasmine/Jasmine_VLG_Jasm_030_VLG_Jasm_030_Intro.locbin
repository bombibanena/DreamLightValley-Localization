Jasmine_000_fp{PlayerName}, I've found a clue for the other key to the Secret Journal! Do you have time to look at it with me?
;
Player_000_choice_001_f Yes! I want this mystery solved!
)
Player_000_choice_002_fNot right now.
¶
Jasmine_002_f¤I discovered that on the back of the first key, there is an engraving of a seashell image. It got me thinking... What if the other lock is a clue to the second key?
1
Jasmine_004_f Great theory! What did you find?
b
Jasmine_005_fQThat's the best part. The second lock does have an engraving... It's a SNOWFLAKE!
3
Player_001_choice_000_fWhy is that so exciting?
6
Player_001_choice_001_fDo you like snow THAT much?
2
Player_001_choice_002_fUgh, I hate the cold...
W
Jasmine_006_fFBecause that points us to SNOW! I think snow's fascinating, don't you?
n
Jasmine_009_f]There isn't any snow near Agrabah. So, as a child, I dreamed of cold, snowy lands to explore.
=
Player_002_choice_000_f"I didn't grow up with snow either.
7
Player_002_choice_001_fI LOVED the snow as a child!
@
Player_002_choice_002_f%We had TOO MUCH snow where I grew up.
S
Jasmine_001_fBI used to daydream about snowmen and snowball fights all the time!
>
Jasmine_015_f-And sledding and warm tea after a cold day...
G
Jasmine_011_f6So what do you think? Should we head towards the snow?
Ç
Jasmine_012_fµYes! I think that's the direction the lock is pointing us. I'll go <Lore>talk to Elsa</Lore> about this. If anyone will know about a mysterious key in the Frosted Heights, it's her!
O
Jasmine_013_f>I loved sledding and building snowmen and all that good stuff!
L
Jasmine_016_f;You're so lucky! I always wanted to go sledding as a child.
X
Jasmine_014_fGI enjoyed playing in it sometimes, but mostly it was just cold and wet.
S
Jasmine_017_fBWell, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound quite as magical.
1
Jasmine_007_f I do! Or at least, I think I do.
e
Jasmine_008_fTReally? I'm definitely more accustomed to the heat, but I find the cold fascinating!
;
Jasmine_003_f*All right. I'll be ready whenever you are.
