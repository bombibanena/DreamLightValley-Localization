Jasmine_000_f°{PlayerName}, I was able to decrypt that strange code on the Secret Journal! I know what needs to be done next, but I could use your help. Do you have some time?
*
Player_000_choice_001_fYes, of course!
'
Player_000_choice_002_fMaybe later.

Jasmine_001_f
Wonderful!
Å
Jasmine_003_fpNow, it turns out the code was actually a recipe to craft a key. It must be one of the keys to open the journal.
Æ
Jasmine_004_fúThe Ingredients indicate we should go to Dazzle Beach. Though, I don't completely understand them. Perhaps someone more familiar with beaches could help us.

Player_001_choice_000_fI bet Moana can help guide us!
'
Player_001_choice_001_fMaybe Goofy?
;
Player_001_choice_002_f Merlin usually knows everything!
/
Jasmine_005_fI was thinking the same thing.
•
Jasmine_009_fìThere's also something about needing <ActivityItem>Sea Sand Sparks</ActivityItem>. I'm not familiar with those, but maybe she'll have some insight.
Ö
Jasmine_010_ftOkay, I'll go <Lore>talk to Moana</Lore> and see if she can help us make our <ActivityItem>Beach Key</ActivityItem>.
U
Jasmine_011_fDFabulous! In the meantime, I'll keep researching the Secret Journal.

Jasmine_012_f
Good luck!
i
Jasmine_006_fXHmm... I'm not sure. We might end up fishing up a shoe or a fishing rod if we ask Goofy.
;
Jasmine_013_f*Maybe we should start with Moana, instead.
x
Jasmine_007_fgThat's true... but I think he'd just encourage us to speak to someone who's spent more time on a beach.
E
Jasmine_008_f4I think we should ask Moana about these Ingredients.
D
Jasmine_002_f3All right. Just come and find me when you're ready.
