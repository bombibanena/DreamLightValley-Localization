Player_000_choice_001_f&I guess you technically broke a law...

Player_000_choice_002_fHow did Aladdin come into it?
p
Jasmine_002_f_The boy was hungry Ã¢Â€Â” I had to do something! But... it was also a mistake. I know that now.

Player_001_choice_001_fHe's a quick thinker!

Jasmine_009_fDHe is. Aladdin learned so much growing up on the streets of Agrabah.

Jasmine_010_fI've learned a lot from him.

Jasmine_011_f:And he learns from me too. I think we have a good balance.

Jasmine_004_f†I did. And I know that now. But it's wrong for people to go hungry while others have so much. Father and I are working to change that.

Jasmine_005_fOh, that's my favorite part...
