q

/
Player_000_choice_000_fThe Peaceful Meadow.
(
Player_000_choice_001_fDazzle Beach!
;
Player_000_choice_002_f Let me think of other options...
N
Jasmine_002_f=It's pretty in the Meadow, but it's not very exciting, is it?
?
Jasmine_003_f.I want to go somewhere that says, "adventure!"
n
Jasmine_004_f]That's a wonderful idea. I do like it there. But even more than the beach, I adore the ocean!
Z
Jasmine_005_fIYou know, I'd never seen an ocean before I got here, except in paintings.

M
Jasmine_011_f<I'd need to get warmer clothing before I go exploring there.
=
Jasmine_012_f,The flowers in the Glade are very beautiful.
J
Jasmine_013_f9But if I go there, I might have to talk to Mother Gothel.
B
Jasmine_014_f1She and I... don't see eye-to-eye on most things.
