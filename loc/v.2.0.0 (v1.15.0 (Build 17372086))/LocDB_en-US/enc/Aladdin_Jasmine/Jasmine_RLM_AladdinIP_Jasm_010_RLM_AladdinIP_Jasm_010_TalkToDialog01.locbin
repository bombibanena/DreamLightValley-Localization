Jasmine_000_fJasmine!
y
Jasmine_001_fhHello? Do I know you? If you're a visitor to Agrabah, I'm afraid you've come at a rather difficult time.
s
Jasmine_009_fbAgrabah is unfortunately a dangerous place right now Ã¢Â€Â” I had not expected to see anyone here.
\
Jasmine_004_fKOh, I'm {PlayerName}. I come from a faraway place called Dreamlight Valley.
‰
Jasmine_005_fxDreamlight Valley... That does sound familiar, but I can't recall exactly where it is. And you... You seem familiar too.
;
Jasmine_002_f*We met before, but it was a long time ago.
O
Player_003_choice_000_f4Maybe if we talk more, your memories will come back.
I
Player_003_choice_001_f.All you need to know is that I'm here to help.
]
Player_003_choice_002_fBThere may be some magic at work here... Let's talk about it later.
G
Jasmine_006_f6It's funny... For some reason, I know I can trust you.
l
Jasmine_003_f[You can. I promise. So... what's been going on here?! Everything is all... windy and sandy.
{
Jasmine_007_fjThat's an understatement. When you came into town, did you see that <Lore>floating stone structure</Lore>?
3
Player_000_choice_000_fIt's kinda hard to miss.
6
Player_000_choice_001_fI was wondering about that.
P
Player_000_choice_002_f5Oh wow, no Ã¢Â€Â” guess I was focusing on the market.
f
Jasmine_011_fUWell, the problems began when we started some recent construction in the marketplace.
}
Jasmine_012_flI wanted to build a new fountain so that everyone in Agrabah could have an additional source of fresh water.
*
Jasmine_013_fSounds like a great idea!
j
Jasmine_014_fYI thought so, but it turns out I should've done more research before choosing a location.
”
Jasmine_015_f‚When the construction crew was excavating to place some pipes, they stumbled onto a buried vault with that stone structure inside.
¤
Jasmine_016_f’As soon as it was exposed to the air, these winds began to stir! The structure floated into the air, and the winds just got stronger and stronger.
v
Jasmine_017_feIn moments, it was hovering over the marketplace and the winds were depositing sand all over Agrabah!
K
Jasmine_019_f:We've been referring to it as <Lore>the Windcaller</Lore>.
:
Player_001_choice_000_fDo you know where it came from?
+
Player_001_choice_001_fWhere's Aladdin?
?
Player_001_choice_002_f$Are the people of Agrabah all right?
-
Player_001_choice_003_fLet's get to work!
~
Jasmine_018_fmNo. But it must be older than Agrabah itself! Or it's from a version of the city that's been lost to history.
I
Jasmine_025_f8Okay Ã¢Â€Â” what's our next step then? I'm here to help.
ð
Jasmine_024_fÞThank you! I can't tell you how much I appreciate that. Now then, I think we should <Lore>find Aladdin</Lore> first. He was looking for a way to stop the winds from the rooftops, but I'm afraid he's been trapped somewhere.
˜
Jasmine_030_f†I've been trying too, but most of Agrabah's streets are blocked by a strange, incredibly tough sandstone formed by the storm deposits.
„
Jasmine_032_fsMaybe I can find a way to help? Normally I would use my Royal Pickaxe, but it doesn't do anything to the sandstone!
a
Jasmine_008_fPDo you think there's something around here that I could use to make it stronger?
†
Jasmine_031_fuHmm... Well, <Lore>the Artisans' District</Lore> is nearby. With any luck, we'll find something there that will help.
‡
Jasmine_021_fvI'm not sure. He and the Magic Carpet were trying to find a way to stop the winds, but Carpet got trapped in a vortex.
t
Jasmine_022_fcAladdin must have been trapped somewhere as well, otherwise he would have certainly returned to me.
S
Jasmine_023_fBFor now, yes. They're sheltering in the palace where they're safe.
R
Jasmine_029_fABut that's not a permanent solution. We need to stop these winds.
