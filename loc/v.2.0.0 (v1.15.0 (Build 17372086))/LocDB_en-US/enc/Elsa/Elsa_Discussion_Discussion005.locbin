Elsa_002_fsIce is sharp and clear. It's very hard... it never bends, but it can curve. I enjoy working with ice. It's precise.

Elsa_003_fÉSnow is light and airy. It's made up of so many little flakes. That can make it harder to control. I'm keeping track of many parts.

Elsa_004_fÄYes. It's strange... it's like there's this warmth within the ice. But it's not normal warmth. It's cold warmth. And it's aware.
