Rapunzel_001_f3Hey Rapunzel, can we talk about Jafar for a moment?
€
Rapunzel_003_fnWe finished his community service, but I'm trying to check in with how he's been treating the other Villagers.
Y
Rapunzel_004_fGHe's actually been really nice! Your community service must be working.
?
Rapunzel_005_f-That's great to hear! What has he been doing?
k
Rapunzel_006_fYWell, he gave me a gift Ã¢Â€Â” some pigments that he said would make really vivid paints.
j
Rapunzel_009_fXAnd, just in case... He didn't ask you to paint a serpent or anything with glowing eyes?
(
Rapunzel_007_fNo, nothing like that!
º
Rapunzel_008_f§He said... that he admired my courage. That it wasn't easy to make art as <Lore>bold</Lore> as mine, and that it required a mind that wasn't afraid to break the rules.

Player_000_choice_000_fHow nice of him!
D
Player_000_choice_001_f)There's a weird sinister layer to that...
W
Rapunzel_010_fERight? I mixed up some paints and it was true Ã¢Â€Â” they're amazing!
L
Rapunzel_012_f:Well, I'd love to see what you painted with them, one day.
{
Rapunzel_000_fiYou know, after hearing what everyone has told me... I think that maybe we should do something for Jafar.
4
Rapunzel_015_f"Yes! We should definitely do that.
d
Rapunzel_016_fRYeah, well, it's clear that Jafar is trying to ingratiate himself to everyone now.
O
Rapunzel_017_f=We should do something to show that we appreciate his effort.
.
Rapunzel_018_fWhat do you think he'd like?
v
Rapunzel_019_fdLet's see... He did kinda show his own interests with his gift choices; we should use that to start!
Ã
Rapunzel_020_f°I've got it! We'll decorate around the Palace with furniture that's <Lore>Red</Lore>, <Lore>Black</Lore>, <Lore>Elegant</Lore>, <Lore>Bold</Lore>, and <Lore>Traditional</Lore>!
^
Rapunzel_022_fLMaybe I should talk to Merlin to get a little something extra special too...
&
Rapunzel_021_fThat's a great idea!
M
Rapunzel_014_f;Thanks for keeping me updated, Rapunzel! Talk to you later.
Z
Rapunzel_011_fHOh... Well, I wonder if that's just how he's used to expressing himself?

Rapunzel_013_fMaybe...
