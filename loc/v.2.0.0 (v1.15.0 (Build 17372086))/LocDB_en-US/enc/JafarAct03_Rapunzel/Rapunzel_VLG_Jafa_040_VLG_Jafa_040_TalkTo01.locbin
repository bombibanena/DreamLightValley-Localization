Rapunzel_000_f&Hey Rapunzel, can we talk about Jafar?
a
Rapunzel_009_fOWhat if your trial asked him to do something that would show him a better path?
=
Rapunzel_010_f+Oh, like a community service kind of thing?
+
Rapunzel_011_fYes! That sounds perfect!

Rapunzel_012_fjI know I always feel happier and more compassionate after spending time with animals. Could Jafar do that?

Rapunzel_014_f9Great suggestion, Rapunzel Ã¢Â€Â” I'll keep that in mind.

Rapunzel_001_fˆI'm putting a trial together, and I just wanted to talk to people about their experiences with him. He said something about your art...?
˜
Rapunzel_003_f…He did. It was a little harsh when he told me that my art would always suffer unless I learned proper geometry and perspective rules.
Ö
Rapunzel_004_fÃBut... when I learned about them, it DID give my paintings a level of realism that I hadn't achieved before. I don't think I'll change my style, but it's nice to know that I could if I wanted to.

Rapunzel_005_f¨On the other hand, he was mean to the capybaras. He tried to hitch them into a train to carry things for him! Huh... I guess I'm not really sure how I feel about Jafar.
?
Rapunzel_006_f-It's okay Ã¢Â€Â” this is a complicated topic!
B
Rapunzel_007_f0I just... I hope he can find a way to be kinder.
