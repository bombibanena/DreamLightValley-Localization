Jafar_000_f"What?! How did you escape my trap?
1
Player_000_choice_000_fNone of your business.

Player_000_choice_001_fI used my imagination.
(
Jafar_001_fWell, it is of no matter.
†
Jafar_010_fwSuch impudence! By my word, it is done! I am visualizing it... and now... I am the most powerful genie in the universe!
J
Jafar_018_f;Hmm. You're still missing one thing that every genie needs.

Jafar_019_fWhat, pray tell?

Jafar_011_f$A lamp to live inside of, of course!
(
Jafar_012_fA lamp? How pedestrian...
K
Jafar_013_f<What use is a lamp when I already have all the power I need?
Y

f
Jafar_007_fWYes, but you aren't an ACTUAL genie. Wow, that must annoy you. So close and yet so far!
O
Jafar_008_f@Bah! If I wished to, I could BECOME a genie simply by saying so!
#
Jafar_009_fRight. I doubt that.
o
Jafar_014_f`If it will quiet you, then I shall make myself the finest lamp ever imagined! Now, prepare to...

M
Player_002_choice_000_f2Genies just can't resist getting trapped in lamps!
