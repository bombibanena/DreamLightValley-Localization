Jafar_003_ftThere you go, Jafar. If you can extract the essences from these items, we'll be one step closer to the Gilded Stone.
Ω
Jafar_009_f≠Each of the Major Essences uses one of the Minor Essences that I brought you √¢¬Ä¬î plus two others. I'll have to <Lore>try different combinations</Lore> to figure this out!
D
Jafar_010_f5Well, I bid you good fortune in your experimentation.

Jafar_000_f%I'll try it out now! Oh, and Jafar...

Jafar_001_fSUrsula says that you owe her a favor now, in return for the information she shared.
o
Jafar_002_f`Oh, how... inconvenient. I am so glad you feel empowered to enter into contracts on my behalf...
ã
Jafar_013_f|I also got some great info... These items can be refined into something called a <ActivityItem>Minor Essence</ActivityItem>.
ù
Jafar_014_fçThen if we combine them in the right way, we should get a <ActivityItem>Major Essence</ActivityItem>, which might get us to the Gilded Stone!
ˇ
Jafar_004_fÔExcellent! While you were away, my own research has uncovered a number of other items that can be refined to interesting substances. Based on your own field research, I may have found additional <ActivityItem>Minor Essences</ActivityItem>.

Jafar_005_fAllow me just a moment and...
h
Jafar_006_fY...there we are! We should now have sufficient stock for a great deal of experimentation.

Jafar_007_fEMy own experiments, thus far, have yet to yield anything interesting.

Jafar_008_fiBased on what I've learned from Jack Skellington, the Fairy Godmother, and Ursula, that's not surprising.
