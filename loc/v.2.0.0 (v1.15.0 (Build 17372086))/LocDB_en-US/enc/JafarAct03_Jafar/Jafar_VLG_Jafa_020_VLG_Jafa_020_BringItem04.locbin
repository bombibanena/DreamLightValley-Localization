Jafar_002_fžWhat?! This is not the Gilded Stone! This is nothing more than a common <ActivityItem>Stone of Creativity</ActivityItem>. It is as powerless as a paperweight!
?
Jafar_003_f0I must think... Where did the calculations fail?
N
Jafar_004_f?Do we need additional essences? Perhaps a type of refined gold?
N
Jafar_005_f?Hurry, {PlayerName} Ã¢Â€Â” back to EVE! We need more Iron Dust!
@
Jafar_006_f1Whoa, hold up, Jafar. I have an idea to fix this.
=
Jafar_007_f.You? You would deign to educate ME on alchemy?
É
Jafar_008_f¹May I remind you that I have spent years studying the works of the greatest alchemical minds? I have spent even longer searching for rare components and performing rigorous experiments.
P
Jafar_009_fABut please, go on, {PlayerName}; what revelation have you for me?
:
Player_000_choice_000_fNo need to be so mean about it.
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/Yeah, your knowledge is clearly working here...
H
Player_000_choice_002_f-Never mind; you can figure this out yourself.

Jafar_010_f"I... I... apologize, {PlayerName}.
F
Jafar_000_f7Emotive Essences? You have not mentioned them thus far.
D
Jafar_011_f5We were so close. I seem to have gotten carried away.

Jafar_014_fPlease, go on.
W
Jafar_015_fHWell, you said alchemy is about the secret rules of the universe, right?
C
Jafar_016_f4Indeed. I am pleased that you were paying attention.
›
Jafar_017_f‹Well, maybe that's the problem Ã¢Â€Â” we're using Dreamlight Valley resources, but we're still using the rules you learned back in Agrabah.

Jafar_018_fThat... that...
A
Jafar_019_f2...that is quite sensible. What would you suggest?
À
Jafar_020_f°I was told there were two special <ActivityItem>Emotive Essences</ActivityItem>. Let me try and track them down... Maybe if we combine them with this stone we'll get somewhere!
s
Jafar_001_fdOh yeah, the Fairy Godmother told me about them when I was tracking down info on the Minor Essences.
z
Jafar_022_fkThe Emotive Essences are super rare! You need to call them out of Dreamlight by performing certain actions.
½
Jafar_023_f­I think it was the <ActivityItem>Essence of Benevolence</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Essence of Wisdom</ActivityItem> that I heard about. I'll try to get ahold of those.
e
Jafar_021_fVHmm... interesting. It is certainly worth an attempt. I shall be here when you return.
A
Jafar_024_f2Jack Skellington filled me in about how they work!
T
Jafar_025_fEUrsula told me all about them... in exchange for that favor from you.
'
Jafar_012_f*sigh* I see your point.

Jafar_013_f	No! Wait!
