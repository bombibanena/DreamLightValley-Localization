Remy_000_fdYou and Goofy caught a bunch of weird stuff around Eternity Isle and you need some recipes for them?
i

Remy_001_f[Well, looks like with the Ingredients Goofy gave you, you could already make a nice meal...
¤

Remy_002_f•Throw a <ActivityItem>Prisma Shrimp</ActivityItem> in with the <ActivityItem>Celery, Butter, Rice, and some Spice</ActivityItem>. It'll be delicious!

Player_000_choice_000_fThanks, Remy! I'll try that!
Q
Player_000_choice_001_f6I think I'll experiment with some other Ingredients...
^

Remy_003_fPNo problem, pal! And whatever you make... let's add it to the menu at Chez Remy!
±

Remy_004_f¢Hmm... I guess if you mashed up that <ActivityItem>Robot Fish</ActivityItem> with some <ActivityItem>Almonds</ActivityItem>, it would be an interesting almondine.
;

Remy_005_f-But careful you don't break your teeth on it.
‡

Remy_006_fyOh, and maybe if you threw that <ActivityItem>Dunebopper</ActivityItem> in with another fish you find in the quicksand...
[

Remy_007_fM...plus a vegetable, a spice, and a <ActivityItem>Sand Worm</ActivityItem>...
_

Remy_008_fQ...well, I don't think the meal would look very pretty, but it would have crunch.

Remy_009_f*Thanks, Remy! I'll see what I can cook up.
