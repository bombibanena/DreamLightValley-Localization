Remy_002_fHow's my favorite chef doing?

Player_000_choice_001_f_Yeah, the man is still ridiculously built after surviving on a diet of only coconuts for years.

Remy_005_f4Both! But it's fine. I'm sure he's totally harmless.
E

Remy_004_f7But hey, we've got to talk about that new meat freezer!
\

Remy_006_fNI'd go to a party with a dozen Gastons to get my paws on some new ingredients!
&

Remy_007_fAny new recipes in mind?
\

Remy_008_fNOh, so many! Pulled pork... shish taouk... maybe even some turnip tartiflette!

Remy_010_fThanks, {PlayerName}!

Remy_011_fcI'm gonna go mingle until Gaston unlocks the freezer for me, and then I'm off to test some recipes!
