Kristoff_000_feHey, {PlayerName}. Aladdin told me you're putting together a marketplace. That's a pretty great idea.
I
Kristoff_002_f7I used to sell a LOT of ice at the market in Arendelle.

Player_000_choice_000_f!Any advice about running a stall?
D
Player_000_choice_001_f)Can we add your stall to the marketplace?

Kristoff_003_fXWell, when I first met Anna, Elsa had accidentally made a permanent winter in Arendelle.

Kristoff_005_fRWith snow and ice everywhere, that would pretty severely cut into my ice business.

Kristoff_006_fjPeople wouldn't NEED what I was selling. So, that's my advice: Sell something people really want, or need!

Player_001_choice_000_fSolid advice!

Kristoff_004_fIYeah, I'd love to have a place in your market... As long as there's room.
