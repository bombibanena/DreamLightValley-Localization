Gaston_001_f-Hey Gaston, got a moment to talk about Jafar?
A
Gaston_002_f1How strange. I was just talking with him earlier.
D
Gaston_003_f4Oh yeah? Was he mean? Nice? Somewhere in the middle?
J
Gaston_004_f:He was finally behaving right Ã¢Â€Â” he brought me a gift!
+
Player_000_choice_000_fHow kind of him!
J
Player_000_choice_001_f/Was this gift a snake statue with glowing eyes?
0
Gaston_009_f And it was even a gift I wanted.
‹
Gaston_011_f{Jafar gave me a set of weights! He said he saw me with coconut-based exercise equipment so he made me something more solid.
}
Gaston_005_fmHe also complimented me on my clothes. Said something about how <Lore>red and black</Lore> were noble colors.
3
Player_001_choice_000_fThat's quite unexpected!
H
Player_001_choice_001_f-Wow, really seems like he's making an effort!
k
Gaston_012_f[I agree. I never thought someone with such skinny arms would even know the word "exercise."
Y
Gaston_007_fIAnything else about your dealings with him that you'd like to pass along?
4
Gaston_008_f$Hmm... Yes! He also complimented me!
0
Gaston_015_f He said I was incredibly strong!
+
Gaston_016_fYeah? What was the context?
n
Gaston_017_f^Well, I was trying out the weights, swinging them around, and I nearly hit myself in the head.
Â
Gaston_018_f±I said something like "good thing that didn't hit my head!" and he said that even if it did, I'd be fine since I was "incredibly thick-headed." See, he complimented my strength!
3
Player_002_choice_000_f... Yes, so nice of him.
4
Player_002_choice_001_fThat's an insult, Gaston.
+
Gaston_019_fHe's all right, that Jafar!
E
Gaston_021_f5Okay, well thanks for answering my questions, Gaston.
y
Gaston_000_fiYou know, after hearing what everyone has told me... I think that maybe we should do something for Jafar.
(
Gaston_006_fAre you sure about that?
b
Gaston_023_fRYeah, well, it's clear that Jafar is trying to ingratiate himself to everyone now.
M
Gaston_024_f=We should do something to show that we appreciate the effort.
-
Gaston_025_fShould we give him some eggs?
“
Gaston_026_f‚I wasn't thinking eggs. Let's see... he did kinda show his own interests with his gift choices Ã¢Â€Â” we should use that to start!
Á
Gaston_027_f°I've got it! We'll decorate around the Palace with furniture that's <Lore>Red</Lore>, <Lore>Black</Lore>, <Lore>Elegant</Lore>, <Lore>Bold</Lore>, and <Lore>Traditional</Lore>!
\
Gaston_028_fLMaybe I should talk to Merlin to get a little something extra special too...

Gaston_022_fBye!
?
Gaston_020_f/But he said it so nicely! You must be mistaken.

Gaston_013_fI agree.
C
Gaston_010_f3I know better than to accept a gift like that! Now.
