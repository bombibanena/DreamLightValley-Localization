Gaston_000_f9The Dreamlight Court will now hear testimony from Gaston.
T
Gaston_009_fDUmm, well... Jafar isn't the only one here that has done bad things.
€
Gaston_010_fïIt will shock you to hear, but I have... on occasion... long in the past... done one or two things that MAY be considered... not good. Plus, Ursula, Scar, and Mother Gothel have all done MANY nasty things, and they're allowed to stay here.
K
Gaston_011_f;That's true... but have they done anything as bad as Jafar?
W
Gaston_012_fGI can't do EVERYTHING for you. You decide. You're the Your Honor judge.
G
Gaston_013_f7No, that's not how you say it, either... oh never mind.
R
Gaston_014_fBThank you for your testimony, Gaston. You can return to the bench.
-
Gaston_001_fIt's very simple, Your Glory.

Gaston_002_fYour Honor.

Gaston_003_fHuh?
^
Gaston_004_fN"Your Honor" is how you address a judge, not "Your Glory." Anyway, keep going.
„
Gaston_006_ftSo yes, Jafar did hypnotize me. But, he also used me for a strength-related task, so I can't be THAT angry with him.
H
Gaston_007_f8You see, as the strongest member of this communityÃ¢Â€Â”
N
Gaston_008_f>The witness will cease self-aggrandizing and get to the point.
