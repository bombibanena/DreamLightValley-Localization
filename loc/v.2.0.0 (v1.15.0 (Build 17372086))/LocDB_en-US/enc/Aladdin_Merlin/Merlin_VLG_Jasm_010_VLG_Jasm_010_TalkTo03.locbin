Merlin_002_f¿Hello, Merlin! Jasmine and I need some help. She found a note about how to make <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem>, but we're not sure what they're for or what that means.
w
Merlin_011_fgHmm... <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem>...? Ah, yes! I remember the very things!
%
Merlin_023_fYou do? That's great!
y
Merlin_008_fiIt is! Heh-heh. Now, let's see... I was instructing Jasmine on arcane flower magic before the Forgetting.
è
Merlin_001_fWe were using <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem> in our work. She's a most excellent researcher, you know.
.
Player_001_choice_000_fSo they're magical?
3
Player_001_choice_001_fCould they be dangerous?
+
Player_001_choice_002_fWhat do they DO?
¨
Merlin_003_fõWell, yes. "Enchanted" in the name rather says it all, doesn't it? And as with many things in Dreamlight Valley, they're sprinkled with very special magic.
.
Merlin_021_fCan you tell me anything else?
¥
Merlin_019_f£Of course. The <ActivityItem>Enchanted Pots of Blooming</ActivityItem> can be used to grow an <ActivityItem>Enchanted Flower</ActivityItem> that contains a secret.
˝
Merlin_000_fÏYou put seeds in one pot, plant flowers in the other pots and <Lore>carefully tend to them so they flourish</Lore>. That will inspire the <ActivityItem>Enchanted Flower</ActivityItem> to grow. Plants do like to work together, after all.
Q
Merlin_022_fAUnfortunately, I... I can't remember anything else at the moment.
=
Merlin_024_f-An Enchanted Flower that contains a secret...
-
Player_000_choice_000_fThat's mysterious.
(
Player_000_choice_001_fHow exciting!
/
Player_000_choice_002_fSounds suspicious...
2
Merlin_025_f"How can a flower contain a secret?
[
Merlin_028_fKOh, I find secrets have a way of hiding in all sorts of interesting places.
.
Merlin_031_fDo you remember ANYTHING else?
â
Merlin_010_fyI do know Jasmine and I were working together to keep this secret safe, and√¢¬Ä¬î Oh! Yes! <Lore>There were seeds</Lore>!
x
Merlin_017_fhI put them in an envelope for safekeeping and hid it inside the Dreamlight Library for Jasmine's return.
©
Merlin_016_fòYou may <Lore>search the Library to find the Envelope of Seeds</Lore> if you like. The seeds are sure to help you uncover the Enchanted Flower's secret.
<
Merlin_026_f,I wonder what this secret could possibly be?
b
Merlin_029_fRIf you and Princess Jasmine are on the case, I suspect we'll find out soon enough!
9
Merlin_027_f)Who is keeping such a well-hidden secret?
V
Merlin_030_fFNow, now, not everyone who has secrets is hiding them with ill intent.
Q
Merlin_004_fAPerhaps. But then, you've never shied away from danger, have you?
S
Merlin_020_fCI suppose not... but I need to know more about this before I go on.
-
Merlin_005_fBesides grow flowers, anyway.
