Player_000_choice_001_f&Looks like a lot of work to rebuild...

Remy_012_fPThanks! My cooking may be based in tradition, but I'm all about innovation, too.

Remy_015_frOkay, we need to start by getting the word out. Why don't you make some free sample deliveries around the Village?
Š

Remy_016_f|And remember: This is a challenge of all your culinary skills. So you'll have to figure out the recipes yourself. Good luck!

Remy_013_fTough, but TOTALLY worth it.

Remy_014_fBDon't worry. I'll definitely make sure your success gets rewarded.

Remy_004_f‚It's definitely a long-term project. But hey, if a rat like me can open up a top-notch Parisian restaurant, I know we can do this.


Remy_005_fGood question.
