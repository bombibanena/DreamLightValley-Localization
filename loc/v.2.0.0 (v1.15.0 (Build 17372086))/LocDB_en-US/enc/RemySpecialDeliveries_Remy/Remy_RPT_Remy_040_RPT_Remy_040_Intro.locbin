Remy_001_fRHey, {PlayerName}! I could use your help with a delivery, and it's kind of urgent.
h

Remy_002_fZScar sent me a message that he "requires" food. And you know how he gets when he's hungry.
R

Remy_003_fDI think our best bet is to make some really filling dishes for Scar.
L

Remy_004_f>Maybe a variety of <ActivityItem>Seafood Meals</ActivityItem>?
v

Remy_017_fhCan you help? Let's just say I'm pretty motivated to keep Scar happy so I don't end up next on the menu.

Player_000_choice_000_fLet's do it!

Player_000_choice_001_fMaybe some other time.

Remy_005_f7Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.
û

Remy_006_fèAnd remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.
p

Remy_007_fbHey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.
≠

Remy_008_fûRemember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.
a

Remy_009_fSI was thinking something upscale. You know how much Scar likes to feel like a king.
¢

Remy_010_fìMaybe some <ActivityItem>Sushi</ActivityItem>? Specifically, <ActivityItem>Tekka Maki</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Maguro Sushi</ActivityItem>.
\

Remy_012_fNAnd it was a bit odd... This time, Scar asked for desserts. A LOT of desserts.
p

Remy_013_fbMaybe he's suddenly gotten a sweet tooth? Still... I can't help feeling that he's up to something.

Remy_015_fQ{PlayerName}! We got another special delivery order. And this one is high-stakes.

Remy_016_fS{PlayerName}! Chez Remy Mobile just got a new order. And this one's a bit daunting.
