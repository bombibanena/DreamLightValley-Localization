Remy_001_f5Well, {PlayerName}? How did things go with Vanellope?
1

Remy_002_f#Did she admit to liking vegetables?
S
Player_000_choice_000_f8She loved them! Even though she didn't want to admit it.
V
Player_000_choice_001_f;I think she'll be ordering some more veggies from you soon.
Å

Remy_003_fsExcellent! I knew she'd like whatever you made. You should be proud, {PlayerName}. That takes real culinary talent.
m

Remy_004_f_Your skills are getting pretty incredible. Who knows? Someday you might open Chez {PlayerName}!

Remy_005_fTHere you go. Some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem>, courtesy of Mr. McDuck.
ë

Remy_006_fÇUse it to build something great for the Village. The more deliveries you do for Chez Remy Mobile, the more we'll be able to order.

Remy_008_f9Did Vanellope unlock the full power of her dragon breath?
!
Player_002_fYes... at Merlin.
,
Player_002_choice_000_fIt was hilarious.
Q
Player_002_choice_001_f6Maybe don't serve her any more spicy food for a while.
ú

Remy_014_fçYikes! Well, I guess her running around like that is free advertising. Maybe I could add a Dragon Breath Special to my menu if it catches on.

Remy_011_fJSo, who did the "final boss" turn out to be? Did Vanellope win the battle?

Player_003_f"The final boss was Scrooge McDuck.
R
Player_003_choice_000_f7He wasn't too happy about being treated like a villain.
@
Player_003_choice_001_f%Which kind of makes sense, honestly?!
ê

Remy_015_fÅI don't blame him. I've heard that a lot of video games don't have such a great attitude toward rats, which is completely unfair.
r

Remy_018_fdBut in any case, it sounds like the dishes you made were perfect for what Vanellope was looking for.
û

Remy_016_fèHmm... big horde of gold... seems to run everything that goes on in the Village behind the scenes... complete control of the Village economy...
?

Remy_017_f1Whoa, I think Vanellope could be on to something.
