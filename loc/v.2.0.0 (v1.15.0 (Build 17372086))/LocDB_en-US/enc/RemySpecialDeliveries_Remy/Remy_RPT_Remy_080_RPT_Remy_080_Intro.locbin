Remy_003_f(Today's customers are... Simba and Nala.
ë

Remy_024_fÇI'm trying to show them that well-prepared, cooked food can be just as good as √¢¬Ä¬î nay, BETTER than √¢¬Ä¬î eating raw antelope.
t

Remy_025_ffThey're a little skeptical. Which I understand. It took my family a while to appreciate good food too.
≤

Remy_026_f£Anyway, I was thinking you could bring them some <ActivityItem>5-Star Meals</ActivityItem> to show them the pleasures of fine dining. The delivery can go to Simba.
;

Remy_008_f-What do you say? Are you up to the challenge?
'
Player_001_choice_000_fLet's do it!

Player_001_choice_001_fMaybe some other time.
E

Remy_009_f7Great! Good luck, {PlayerName}. I know you've got this.
û

Remy_010_fèAnd remember to come visit me once you're done delivering your order. I'll have some <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> waiting for you.
p

Remy_011_fbHey, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind and decide you want a new culinary challenge.
≠

Remy_012_fûRemember: The more daily deliveries you do, the more <ActivityItem>Wrought Iron</ActivityItem> I can order so you can build more great things for the Village.
†

Remy_017_fëJack Skellington came into the restaurant today and placed an odd order. Man, that guy is tall. He had to bend in half to tell me what he wanted!
à

Remy_018_fzTurns out he's looking for some <ActivityItem>Spaghetti Arrabbiata, Hardboiled Eggs, and Roasted Asparagus</ActivityItem>.
g

Remy_027_fYIt's not my idea of a well-coordinated three-course meal, but "to each his own," I guess.
ü

Remy_019_fêScrooge McDuck would like a meal that reminds him of home. Do you think you can make something so that he feels like he's back in Castle McDuck?
w

Remy_020_fiSome <ActivityItem>Potato Leek Soup, Baked Carp, and Gooseberry Pie</ActivityItem> ought to do the trick.
l

Remy_028_f^Anna wants to prove to Kristoff that you can serve chocolate for every meal, not just dessert.
—

Remy_029_f¬She'd like some <ActivityItem>Hot Cocoa, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Chocolate Waffles, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Mint Chocolate</ActivityItem> to change his mind. The delivery should go to Kristoff.
B

Remy_053_f4Goofy and Vanellope are having a pie-eating contest.
=

Remy_054_f/They need two of each of these kinds of pies...
S

Remy_055_fEThey want an <ActivityItem>Apple Pie, Blueberry Pie...</ActivityItem>
!

Remy_057_f...*deep breath*...
J

Remy_058_f<<ActivityItem>...Seafood Pie, and Veggie Pie!</ActivityItem>
Ç

Remy_059_ftWow. I feel full just saying all that. I can't even imagine eating it all. They said to deliver everything to Goofy.
å

Remy_060_f~Mickey and Goofy are going ice-fishing in the Frosted Heights together, and they're looking for a nice meal to keep them warm.
ú

Remy_061_fçI'm thinking <ActivityItem>Hot Cocoa, Creamy Soup, Greek Pizza, and Jam Waffles</ActivityItem>. Mickey said we can deliver everything to him.
Z

Remy_085_fLYou're not going to believe it, but I just got an order from Woody and Buzz.
ô

Remy_086_fäIt's a pretty strange one, too... They're looking for <ActivityItem>Roasted Asparagus,
Gingerbread Houses, and Ranch Salad</ActivityItem>.
ï

Remy_087_fÜI know those toys don't eat, so I wonder what they plan to use it all for... Well anyway, they want you to take the delivery to Woody.
n

Remy_088_f`Some of the other Villagers pooled together their Star Coins to buy a thank-you meal for Merlin.
Y

Remy_089_fKWhenever there's a strange problem around here, he always knows what to do.
£

Remy_090_fîSo the Villagers figured he might like a nice <ActivityItem>Cheese Platter, some Fish Creole, and Pastry Cream and Puffs</ActivityItem> for dessert.
L

Remy_022_f>{PlayerName}! I've got another special delivery order for you.
V

Remy_023_fHHey, {PlayerName}, have you got time for another Chez Remy Mobile order?
