Mirabel_000_f/Antonio is going to love the pictures you took!

Mirabel_001_fkBut some of those chig√É¬ºiros looked a little hungry. I wonder if we should try <Lore>feeding them</Lore>?
?
Mirabel_002_f.What do you think their favorite food is here?

Player_000_choice_000_fVeggies...?

Player_000_choice_001_fAnything 5 stars?

Player_000_choice_002_f%Obviously molten chocolate lava cake.

Mirabel_003_f0That makes sense... But what kind of vegetables?
ç
Mirabel_007_f|If we can <Lore>figure out the chig√É¬ºiros' favorite food</Lore> and feed them, I can include that in my letter to Antonio.
G
Mirabel_008_f6He'll want to know if they're like the ones back home.

Mirabel_009_fkThere must be <Lore>someone who's spent a lot of time in the Wild Tangle</Lore> who knows what they like...
S
Mirabel_004_fBHmm... If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably something simpler.
P
Mirabel_006_f?Heh-heh! I think you're thinking of Anna, not the chig√É¬ºiros.
E
Mirabel_005_f4Ooh, no. I think that would make a chig√É¬ºiro sick.
