Mushu_003_fHOkay, okay, I'm gonna drop the Sergeant Mushu stuff so we can just talk.
J
Mushu_004_f;Because I'm telling you, {PlayerName}, we have A LOT to do!

Mushu_005_fpWe gotta come up with a defense system that'll make any invaders who wanna attack China turn around and amscray.
:
Mushu_007_f+Do you have an idea of what you want to do?
m
Mushu_008_f^I... don't. See, I'm more of a "personal Guardian" and not so much an "all of China" Guardian.
í
Mushu_009_fÇI want something that'll strike fear in the mind of any invader and pride in the heart of any defender. Something real impressive.
H
Player_000_f8Why not a Dragon Army of statues? With you as the model?
A
Player_000_choice_000_f&You terrified me when I first saw you.
0
Player_000_choice_001_fYou're fierce enough.
5
Player_000_choice_002_fYou're perfectly portable!
J
Mushu_011_f;Of course I did. But no need to butter me up, {PlayerName}.
V
Mushu_018_fGWell, look at you, "everything's under control" recruit! I'm impressed.
j
Mushu_019_f[How long do you need me to pose to capture my likeness for these things? Three hours? Five?
*
Mushu_020_fJust a couple of seconds...

Mushu_021_fWhat?!
ç
Mushu_002_f~I'm going to <Lore>take a picture of you, Mushu</Lore>. I've got this little machine to make instant portraits. I'll show you.
Z
Mushu_014_fKLet me think... Yes! A <ActivityItem>Dragon Army</ActivityItem> is perfect!
î
Mushu_015_fÑAnd it won't be that hard. We can find everything we need right here. Some <ActivityItem>Firewood</ActivityItem> as a combustible...
á
Mushu_000_fxSome <ActivityItem>Camp Mud</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Buckets of Water</ActivityItem> to make the Dragon Statues.
û
Mushu_001_féPLUS, I saw some <ActivityItem>Red Spider Lilies</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Chrysanthemums</ActivityItem> that'd make pretty nice paint.
L
Mushu_006_f=It's just too bad the dragons won't breathe fire like I do...
;
Mushu_010_f,You know, I might be able to help with that.
i
Mushu_016_fZYou could?! That would be amazing. Incredible! EPIC! Wait √¢¬Ä¬î how're you gonna do that?
Ω
Mushu_017_f≠Let's just say I have a magic touch... and something called <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>. All you'll have to do is breath fire on the statues when they're done.
!
Mushu_012_fTrue, I AM fierce.
c
Mushu_013_fTTHAT'S a dig at my size that I will ignore because this idea is too good to pass up.
