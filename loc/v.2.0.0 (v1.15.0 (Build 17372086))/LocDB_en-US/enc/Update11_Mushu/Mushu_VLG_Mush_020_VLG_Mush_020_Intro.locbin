Mushu_005_fI thought you'd never ask.
π
Mushu_009_f©When I try to talk to him, he won't look me in the eye. Plus, he's always mumbling. I get the feeling he lacks self-confidence, which just breaks my little dragon heart.

Mushu_013_fvThe first step in the program. Trying to understand the one you're helping by figuring out what they're going through.
ê
Mushu_014_fÄAction is step two. We take what we learned about our subject and find actions they can do to get 'em feeling better right away.
ß
Mushu_015_fóBy the time we reach step three √¢¬Ä¬î Immersion √¢¬Ä¬î we know what's going on with our friend, and we've helped 'em feel better... At least a little.
F
Mushu_011_f7Then it's time to really dig in to see what's going on.
R
Mushu_010_fCGreat! I think he knows I'm onto him because he's been avoiding me.
I
Mushu_012_f:Ooh, you and me doing Guardian things together? I love it!
l
Mushu_004_f]You're right. Some folks are shy, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this is different.

Mushu_006_fSWell, I wouldn't go that far, but I'm glad we both see it. That guy needs our help.
<
Mushu_001_f-I get it. Just come find me later, all right?
