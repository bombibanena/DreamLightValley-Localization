Y
Mushu_002_fJA Red Pouch Scavenger Hunt, a cooking challenge, and a special party game!
*
Player_000_choice_000_fRed Pouch hunt?
&
Player_000_choice_001_fA cook-off?
.
Player_000_choice_002_fSpecial party game?
:
Player_000_choice_003_fI'm ready to do ALL this stuff!
æ
Mushu_011_fÆYeah, where Mulan and I come from, it's a real important New Year's tradition to give Lucky Red Envelopes with money inside. It's a gesture of goodwill and a wish for wealth.
§
Mushu_005_fîSo, I wanna take that special tradition and give it a Dreamlight Valley spin. I've hidden <ActivityItem>Red Pouches</ActivityItem> around the Mines.
>
Mushu_007_f/If you find 'em, you get to keep what's inside!
T
Mushu_003_fEYep, I've got a recipe for <ActivityItem>Sesame Balls</ActivityItem>!
>
Mushu_008_f/It's a contest, plus a treat! Pretty cool, huh?
T
Mushu_004_fEYou got it! I based it on a spring festival tradition from back home.
Æ
Mushu_009_fûWe fill these big containers with seeds and try to break 'em by hitting 'em with sticks. The seeds come out, and it means good weather for the growing season!
M
Mushu_013_f>My game's like that, except the container's filled with candy.
z
Mushu_000_fkMushu... Something filled with candy you try to break during a party? That kind of sounds like a pi√É¬±ata.
ç
Mushu_012_f~Huh. Never heard of it. But, sure, we can call it that. Ooh, and it'll be easier to fit on the sign than "Special Party Game"!
å
Mushu_010_f}Anyway, during the spring festivals, our "pi√É¬±atas" are usually shaped like farm animals. But I shaped mine like fireworks.
f
Mushu_014_fWYou know, to make the <Lore>candy</Lore> look all bright and sparkly when it falls out!
U
Mushu_006_fFHeh-heh. All right, enjoy yourself, {PlayerName}! I'm gonna go mingle.
