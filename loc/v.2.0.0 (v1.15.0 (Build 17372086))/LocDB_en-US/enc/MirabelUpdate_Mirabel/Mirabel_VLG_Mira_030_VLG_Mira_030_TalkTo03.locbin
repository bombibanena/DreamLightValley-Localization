Mirabel_000_f5So how did it go with Mister McDuck? Is he still mad?
Š
Mirabel_001_fyHe was happy to get his <ActivityItem>Cash Register Key</ActivityItem> back. He still seemed a bit mad at Donald, though.
…
Mirabel_002_ftI just wish they could get along like they used to. Sure, they'd have the occasional quarrel, but nothing like this.
S
Mirabel_013_fBI have so many family photos of them from before the Forgetting...

Mirabel_003_fWait...
£
Mirabel_004_f‘Photos! That's it! I'll find a happy photo of them in my album, make a frame, then maybe if we brought them together for a nice dinner, andÃ¢Â€Â”
f
Player_000_fVWhoa! Slow down. How about you find the photo, and I'll make the meal and the frame...
A
Player_000_choice_000_f&I want to be part of solving this too.
I
Player_000_choice_001_f.It'll give you time to find the perfect photo.
B
Player_000_choice_002_f'I don't want you to go overboard again.
S
Mirabel_005_fBThat would be great! You know what they say: the more the merrier.
M
Mirabel_006_f<Maybe the frame could be themed to something they both love?
•
Mirabel_007_fƒWell, Donald lives on a boat and Scrooge McDuck is a renowned adventurer so maybe... a <ActivityItem>Seashell Frame</ActivityItem>?
Ë
Mirabel_008_f¹I should put <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Softwood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Clams</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Scallops</ActivityItem> together to make it.
°
Mirabel_009_fžThat would totally work, {PlayerName}! And for the meal, I think we should go with something they can share, like... a <ActivityItem>Fruit Pie</ActivityItem>!
r
Mirabel_010_faHere, I just read about it in this <ActivityItem>Recipe Book</ActivityItem> I borrowed from Remy.
*
Mirabel_011_fGreat idea, {PlayerName}!
t
Mirabel_012_fcYeah... I tend to do that, don't I? Hopefully, if we work together, we'll get it just right. Hmm...
