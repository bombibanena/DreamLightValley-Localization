Mirabel_000_faThat's it! The tablecloth... for the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>. I remember now!
v
Mirabel_001_feMoana, Anna, Elsa and I... We were such good friends. We spent so much time together. It was amazing!
]
Mirabel_002_fLMoana reminded me of my sister Luisa. She's always so strong and protective.
*
Mirabel_003_fWhat about Anna and Elsa?
¶
Mirabel_004_fîWell, I have a lot in common with Anna. We both have sisters who have magical gifts, and we don't. Plus, we both like making sure everyone is happy.
ù
Mirabel_005_fãAnd Elsa... At first I thought she was a bit of a se√É¬±orita perfecta like Isabela used to be. But she's so nice once you get to know her.
ê
Mirabel_006_fWe would gather around my <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem> for parties or go on adventures. We had such a good time.
X
Mirabel_007_fGI wish it were still like that. The Forgetting... it took away so much.

Player_000_choice_000_fIt'd be so cute.

Player_000_choice_001_fWhere do you propose we start?
S
Player_000_choice_002_f8I'll bet there's some spark left of all that friendship.
#
Mirabel_008_fOh, I'd love that!
ù
Mirabel_009_fãBut we'd need the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem> to do that... And I haven't seen it anywhere since I got back to the Village.
l
Mirabel_010_f[The Memory took place on the Beach. Maybe I could find some clue about what happened there.
•
Mirabel_011_fìWell, I suppose we could start by searching for the <ActivityItem>Madrigal Table</ActivityItem>... But I haven't seen it anywhere since I got back.
'
Mirabel_012_fOh, I'm sure there is!
?
Mirabel_013_f.Hmm... But how would we recreate the Memory...
