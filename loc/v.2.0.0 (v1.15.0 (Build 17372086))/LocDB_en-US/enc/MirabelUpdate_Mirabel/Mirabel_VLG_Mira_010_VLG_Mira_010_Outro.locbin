Mirabel_001_fMBoth our Houses are looking so much better. I'd say that's pretty impressive.

Mirabel_002_foAnd now that Mini-Casita is fixed, I really want to make myself useful by helping you help the other Villagers.

Mirabel_003_fLBecause that's what la familia Madrigal is all about. Helping the community!

Mirabel_004_fMI'll be your eyes and ears around here and let you know if anyone needs help.

Mirabel_005_fLSee you soon, {PlayerName}. And thanks again for your help with Mini-Casita.
