Mirabel_000_f4{PlayerName}, I'm sorry to bother you but I think...
Å
Mirabel_001_fpWell, I think the Forgetting took a memory from me. An important one. And I could use some help getting it back.
.
Player_000_choice_000_fOh no, what was it?
F
Player_000_choice_001_f+I promise I'll help you, but not right now.
ò
Mirabel_002_fÜIt's a recipe. You see, I was thinking that since we're back in the Village, and more and more people are coming back to the Valley...

Mirabel_003_fn...that calls for a celebration! And I have the perfect food for it. <ActivityItem>Bu√É¬±uelos</ActivityItem>!
v
Mirabel_004_feExcept, I can't remember the recipe to give to Remy. I can barely even remember what they taste like.
x
Mirabel_005_fgNo matter how hard I concentrate, there's nothing but emptiness in my head where it was supposed to be.
;
Mirabel_006_f*Like it's been erased or taken... somehow.
U
Mirabel_007_fDAnd it's my mam√É¬°'s recipe. Losing it is like losing a part of me.
<
Player_001_choice_000_f!I'm sure we can find it together!
@
Player_001_choice_001_f%You don't remember anything about it?
C
Player_001_choice_002_f(Are you sure you're not just distracted?
≤
Mirabel_008_f†Oh, I'm so glad you'll help. And I've got an idea where we can start. Somehow the magic of Mini-Casita kept a fresh plate of them in the cupboard all this time.
h
Mirabel_009_fWMaybe we could do a taste test? See if we can figure out what ingredients go into them.
ä
Mirabel_010_fyThough, I'm not nearly as good a cook as Mam√É¬°. She's a true artist. Not to mention, her meals can heal you. Literally.
Y
Mirabel_011_fHGive me the plate. I'll ask Remy. He's the real food expert around here.
)
Mirabel_012_fGreat idea! Here you go!
ﬂ
Mirabel_013_fÕNo, but I still have a plate of them. Somehow the magic of Mini-Casita kept them fresh in the cupboard all this time. Maybe we could do a taste test? See if we can figure out what ingredients go into them.
Œ
Mirabel_014_fºNo way. It's my mam√É¬°'s recipe, and I can't even remember the taste. That's not something I'd forget just like that... But the important part is that I think I know how to figure it out.
