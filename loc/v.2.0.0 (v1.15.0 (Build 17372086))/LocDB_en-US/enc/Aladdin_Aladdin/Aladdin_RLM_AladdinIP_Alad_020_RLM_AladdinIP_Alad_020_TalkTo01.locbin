Aladdin_001_fsAladdin! I spotted the <Lore>gemstones from the Protection Amulet</Lore>! The monkeys up on the rooftops have them!
V
Aladdin_002_fEDid... did Agrabah have troops of monkeys roaming the streets before?
‚
Aladdin_003_fqNo way! They must've moved in and claimed that area of the marketplace after everyone had to flee the sandstorms.

Player_000_choice_000_fThe monkeys are pretty cute!

Player_000_choice_001_f%What would Abu say about the monkeys?
^
Player_000_choice_002_fCThere are a lot of monkeys Ã¢Â€Â” wouldn't want to make them angry.
h
Aladdin_010_fWThey are, aren't they? But if they're anything like Abu, they'd HATE being called cute.
S
Aladdin_000_fBIf Abu had the gemstones, how would you get him to hand them over?
P
Aladdin_007_f?Oh, he'd never just hand them over. I'd have to trade for them.
h
Aladdin_008_fWWell, they seem to like the shiny gemstones. Maybe we should find something else shiny.
‹
Aladdin_005_fzYeah. Maybe if we keep <Lore>cleaning up the marketplace, we'll find something they like better than the gemstones</Lore>.
U
Aladdin_004_fDOh, he'd probably be mad that they're taking food he wants to steal.
@
Aladdin_011_f/No, I think we're gonna have to be clever here.
