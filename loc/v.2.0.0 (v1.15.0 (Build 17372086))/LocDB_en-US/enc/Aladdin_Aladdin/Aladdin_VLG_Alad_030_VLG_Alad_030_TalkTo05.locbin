Aladdin_005_f‰Could be. Is there <Lore>someone in the Valley who knows about the island</Lore> who could help us figure out if there's a missing piece?

Aladdin_007_fyI'll <Lore>take a photo</Lore> and <Lore>go ask around the Village</Lore> about the island, the symbols, and art history.

Aladdin_001_f]Great! I might stay here and keep watch over this thing or search the Village for more clues.

Aladdin_006_fGMe neither... But maybe someone in the Village does. What do you think?
