Buzz_000_f(Greetings, {PlayerName}. How can I help?
*

Buzz_006_fHi, Buzz. Do you know Timon?
E

Buzz_002_f7Affirmative. I've seen him scurrying around the Valley.
#

Buzz_005_fHe seems... skittish.
D
Player_001_choice_000_f)He's just adjusting to Dreamlight Valley.
.
Player_001_choice_001_fI think he's funny!
B
Player_001_choice_002_f'Skittish is a bit of an understatement.

Buzz_007_fThat's understandable.
E

Buzz_010_f7This place can be a bit daunting when you first arrive.
˜

Buzz_011_f‰Anyway, he's currently making a slideshow presentation and we need a recording device for his narration. Do you have anything we can use?
 

Buzz_012_fUnfortunately, no.
Ö

Buzz_014_fÇI did lose some <ActivityItem>Batteries</ActivityItem> in the river in the Forest of Valor recently. You might try fishing them out of there. That way, when you find your device, you can power it up.
e

Buzz_015_fWI also saw some <ActivityItem>Electronic Components</ActivityItem> floating there, too.
T

Buzz_016_fFGreat! I'll go <Lore>fish in the Forest of Valor</Lore>! Thanks, Buzz.
(

Buzz_008_fYes, he is. Quite amusing.
K

Buzz_009_f=I can't disagree. He almost reminds me of my good friend Rex.
