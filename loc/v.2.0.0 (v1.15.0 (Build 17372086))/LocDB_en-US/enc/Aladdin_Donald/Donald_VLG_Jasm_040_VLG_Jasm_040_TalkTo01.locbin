Donald_000_f@Hello, Donald! I heard you were having a problem with some fish?
)
Donald_001_fThat's one way to put it.
7
Donald_002_f'I'm being TORMENTED by old stinky fish!
W
Donald_003_fGFish, fish, fish! Everywhere fish! And not even nice fresh fish either!
9
Player_000_choice_000_fDid someone bring them to you?
2
Player_000_choice_001_fWhy not throw them out?
:
Player_000_choice_002_fSounds like you need less fish.
6
Donald_004_f&No! They just appeared out of nowhere!
3
Donald_007_f#It must be some sort of FISH MAGIC!
1
Donald_008_f!Wait... Fish magic or WISH magic?

Donald_009_fHuh?
A
Player_001_choice_000_f&Did you wish for these fish to appear?
0
Player_001_choice_001_fYou know what I mean.
E
Player_001_choice_002_f*Never mind; it's probably just fish magic.
l
Donald_010_f\Um... Maybe. BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT! I was just so frustrated by how few fish I was catching.
*
Donald_017_fAnd did you WISH for them?
V
Donald_018_fFWell sure, I guess I did, but what does that have to do with anything?
e
Donald_019_fUI think some sort of wish magic is loose in the Valley, but I can't be sure just yet.
€
Donald_022_fpLet me <Lore>clean up the stinky fish</Lore> for you, and then I'll figure out how to get to the bottom of this.

Donald_011_fNo, I don't.
R
Donald_013_fBCome on; something tells me you wished for these fish, didn't you?
H
Donald_015_f8Maybe I WAS frustrated by how few fish I was catching...
6
Donald_012_f&Okay, but WHAT is fish magic, anyway?!
J
Donald_014_f:I have no idea. Has anything else unusual happened lately?
T
Donald_016_fDNo. But I HAVE been frustrated by how few fish I've been catching...
X
Donald_005_fHI tried that! But the more I pick up, the more appear all over my House!
C
