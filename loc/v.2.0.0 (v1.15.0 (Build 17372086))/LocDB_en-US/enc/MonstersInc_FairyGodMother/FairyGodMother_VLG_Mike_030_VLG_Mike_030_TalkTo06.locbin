FairyGodMother_000_f#{PlayerName}, how are you, my dear?
_
FairyGodMother_001_fGQuite well, thank you! I'm trying to help Mike Wazowski with something.
R
FairyGodMother_002_f:Well, that's very kind of you. What is Michael in need of?
x
FairyGodMother_003_f`He's looking for people that might be interested in learning comedy. How does that sound to you?
Y
FairyGodMother_004_fAOh my. Learning comedy? I'm not sure I'm really the comedic sort.
W
FairyGodMother_005_f?You never know. Sometimes you get surprised by a hidden talent!
'
FairyGodMother_006_fI don't know...
g
Player_001_choice_001_fLWhat if I tell you a joke, and then you try to imagine yourself in my place?
Z
Player_001_choice_002_f?No problem. You don't have to participate if you don't want to!
"
FairyGodMother_026_f
All right.
&
Player_000_fOkay, I'll tell you...
1
Player_000_choice_000_f...a knock-knock joke.
.
Player_000_choice_001_f...a wordplay joke.
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&...a "chicken crossing the road" joke.
j
FairyGodMother_023_fRMy magic is more about helping people achieve their dreams than making them laugh.
,
FairyGodMother_024_fThat's really sweet.
w
FairyGodMother_025_f_I'll head back to my task then, and let you keep on helping people with their hopes and dreams!
$
FairyGodMother_007_fKnock knock!
7
FairyGodMother_008_fOh... what are you knocking on?

FairyGodMother_009_fgIt's the setup for the joke Ã¢Â€Â” I'm knocking on the door that you're behind, and you need to answer.
a
FairyGodMother_010_fIOh, how fun! May my door answer? Sometimes I like to enchant it to speak.
l
FairyGodMother_011_fTUhhh, I guess? Your door needs to respond with "who's there?" for this kind of joke.
o
FairyGodMother_012_fWFortunately, my enchanted doors can see, so they'll know that it's you that's knocking!
L
FairyGodMother_013_f4Okay, this isn't working the way I thought it would.
\
FairyGodMother_022_fDI understand, {PlayerName}. I suppose comedy isn't exactly my forte.
4
FairyGodMother_014_fWhy was six afraid of seven?
G
FairyGodMother_015_f/Oh dear, I hope seven wasn't being mean to six!
:
FairyGodMother_016_f"No, it's because seven eight nine!
1
FairyGodMother_028_fGet it... seven ate nine?
2
FairyGodMother_017_fI'm sorry, I don't follow.
b
FairyGodMother_018_fJA chicken crossing the road? If it's a busy road, that could be dangerous!
D
FairyGodMother_019_f,Well, it's something of a figurative road...
N
FairyGodMother_020_f6May I be in the joke to help the chicken cross safely?
X
FairyGodMother_021_f@Perhaps I could enchant a gourd into a carriage for the chicken!

FairyGodMother_027_fEThat might be best, dear. I don't really consider myself a performer.
