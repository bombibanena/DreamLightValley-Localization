O
TheForgotten_001_f9You wanted to talk to me...? Did I do something wrong...?
)
Player_000_choice_000_fOf course not!
,
Player_000_choice_001_fJust checking in.
^
Player_000_choice_002_fCAs long as you haven't torn open reality again, I think we're good.
@
TheForgotten_020_f*I'm just visiting to see how you're doing!
p
TheForgotten_013_fZSay, I do remember a few things in the Village that I used to think were really beautiful.
p
TheForgotten_014_fZThere was this <Lore>one yellow flower in the Forgotten Lands</Lore> that was really cool.
Z
TheForgotten_015_fDAnd there was this <Lore>really neat bird with dark feathers</Lore>!
µ
TheForgotten_016_fûOh, and I think the most awesome thing in the whole Valley is that <Lore>giant skull near Dazzle Beach</Lore>! I bet you could get a pretty good shot of that.
N
Player_001_f>So your idea of beauty is... flowers, birds, and giant skulls.

Player_001_choice_000_fI love it!!! Me too.
K
Player_001_choice_001_f0Very unconventional choices, but I support them.
F
TheForgotten_002_f0Oh. It's... really nice of you to actually care.
O
TheForgotten_006_f9I'm doing okay. Everyone in the Village has been so nice.
¢
TheForgotten_007_fãBut... I don't know... today I'm feeling a little... bored? Or like... everything I look at today, it just feels so... boring and ordinary.
ê
TheForgotten_011_fzI remember when we were younger, everything was cool and exciting and beautiful. I wish I could see things that way again.
[
TheForgotten_008_fEWell, everything can be beautiful if you look at it in the right way.
?
TheForgotten_010_f)So... it all depends on how you frame it?
•
TheForgotten_009_féFrame it...! That's it! Why don't we <Lore>take some pictures</Lore> to show you how beautiful even ordinary things around the Village can be?
(
TheForgotten_012_fThat could be fun!
Y
TheForgotten_017_fCOh, wow, really? It's nice to have somebody around who understands.

TheForgotten_019_fGLet's see what we can do. <Lore>Three pictures</Lore>, coming right up!
!
TheForgotten_018_fAw, thanks.
U
TheForgotten_003_f?Don't worry. I definitely won't be making THAT mistake twice...
-
