*
Player_000_choice_001_fNeed some help?
H
Player_000_choice_002_f-Don't let me interrupt your creative process.
J
TheForgotten_002_f4Oh! {PlayerName}! Actually... I could use your help!
‰
TheForgotten_005_fsYou see, I've been trying to find some healthier ways to express my emotions. So I've been writing a lot of poetry.
o
TheForgotten_006_fYBut I'm really stuck on this one poem... about what happened to me. About the Forgetting.
‡
TheForgotten_007_fqAre you good at this sort of thing? You know, poems and expressing your feelings through words and all that junk.
1
Player_001_choice_000_fI'm pretty good at it.
4
Player_001_choice_001_fI'm trying to get better.
F
Player_001_choice_002_f+I don't write poems. I commit rhyme crimes.
5
TheForgotten_008_fPerfect!!! I knew you would be.
J
TheForgotten_011_f4There are three verses I don't know how to finish...
Ç
TheForgotten_018_f°There's one about <Lore>being jealous and wishing I were still ruler</Lore>, one about <Lore>being afraid to get older</Lore>, and one about <Lore>being unfairly exiled</Lore>.
C
Player_002_choice_000_f(Read me the one about the jealous ruler.
I
Player_002_choice_001_f.Read me the one about the jealous ruler again.
O
Player_002_choice_002_f4Read me the one about being afraid of getting older.
U
Player_002_choice_003_f:Read me the one about being afraid of getting older again.
G
Player_002_choice_004_f,Read me the one about being unfairly exiled.
M
Player_002_choice_005_f2Read me the one about being unfairly exiled again.
P
Player_002_choice_006_f5Maybe we could ask for help from the other Villagers?
L
TheForgotten_012_f6<Lore>I once was the ruler of all I surveyed...</Lore>
M
TheForgotten_013_f7<Lore>But now I'm cast out and I feel so afraid.</Lore>
P
TheForgotten_015_f:<Lore>Nothing I do seems to make the world right...</Lore>
F
TheForgotten_016_f0Something something... that rhymes with "right."
-
TheForgotten_017_fHm. That's a tough one.
X
TheForgotten_019_fB<Lore>As I watch the clock tick and the sun rise and set...</Lore>
M
TheForgotten_020_f7<Lore>I fear what I love, I am doomed to forget.</Lore>
Q
TheForgotten_021_f;<Lore>But I've never been one to do what I'm told...</Lore>
A
TheForgotten_022_f+Then I need a line that rhymes with "told."
S
TheForgotten_023_f=So many things rhyme with "told"... "fold," "bold," "cold"...
R
TheForgotten_024_f<<Lore>It seems there's no place I will ever belong...</Lore>
R
TheForgotten_025_f<<Lore>And all of my words seem to come out all wrong.</Lore>
W
TheForgotten_026_fA<Lore>But I'll wait for an answer, I'll wait for a sign...</Lore>
L
TheForgotten_027_f6Yada, yada, yada... something that rhymes with "sign."
4
TheForgotten_028_fLet me think about that one...
m
TheForgotten_029_fWYou... want to ask the other Villagers? But... would any of them really get how I feel?
w
TheForgotten_030_faWe've got a lot of Villagers here! I just know some of them will understand exactly how you feel.
H
TheForgotten_031_f2And... you don't think they'll laugh at my poetry?
@
Player_003_choice_000_f%Of course not! Everyone will love it.
[
Player_003_choice_002_f@You can't let those fears stop you from sharing your creativity.
l
TheForgotten_032_fVYou know what? You're right! I'm just a little nervous about talking to them myself...
^
TheForgotten_033_fHBut here, I'll give you my scrap of paper with what I've written so far.
¨
TheForgotten_034_f‘I guess now I'll just need to find a <Lore>jealous wannabe ruler, someone afraid of getting older, and somebody who was unfairly exiled</Lore>...
>
TheForgotten_009_f(Great! Maybe we can get better together?
_
TheForgotten_010_fIHa! Me too. But maybe if we work together, we can come up with something.
O

h
TheForgotten_004_fROh! {PlayerName}! No! Please! Interrupt away! I'm stuck and I could use some help.
