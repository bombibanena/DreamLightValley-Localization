Woody_003_fcLooks like you saved the day, partner. Who knew fishing and harvesting crops could be so dangerous?

Woody_004_f‚*sigh* I don't know what to do now. I really wanna help out, but the Valley's a lot bigger and more complicated than a kid's room.

Player_000_choice_002_f*I get overwhelmed sometimes too, you know.

Woody_001_fjI know, I know. You're right, {PlayerName}. I just gotta pull up my bootstraps and figure out what's next.
t
Woody_000_feThere's a bunch of piles of junk inside. I tried to clear 'em out myself, but they're too big for me.
z
Woody_007_fkI'll help you clean up the Carousel. Maybe we can figure out what's so special about it. Let's get started.

Woody_013_fGSay, instead of you trying to help everyone else, why don't I help you?

Woody_008_fIs there anything you need?

Woody_009_fcWell... now that you mention it, yeah. There's my Carousel Mr. McDuck dragged outta storage for me.

Woody_010_f™I've been wonderin' about it. I know it's got the horses and the whole Western motif, but it seems like kind of a funny place for me to live, doesn't it?

Woody_011_foI thought I would've been more comfortable in a nice ranch playset, or a sheriff's office made outta cardboard.

Woody_012_fFMr. McDuck said there's something special about it. Something magical.
{
Woody_014_flHuh... Well, if there's something special about it, I can't remember what. And it sure has seen better days.

Woody_016_fTake a look...

Woody_002_fsI know. It's just... I'm so good at helping my fellow toys and makin' kids happy, I wish I were better at all this.
