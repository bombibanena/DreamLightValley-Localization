Player_000_choice_002_fI loved my toys.
ç
Woody_002_f~I bet you were. Course I think all kids are pretty good. Oh, except maybe Sid. (Wonder what ever happened to him...) Anyway...
c
Woody_005_fTThere comes a time in every toy's life when their kid just doesn't need 'em anymore.
y
Woody_006_fjAnd that's okay. It means the kid's growin' up. But how do you deal with it when they're ready to move on?

Player_002_choice_000_fYou should move on too.

Woody_010_fWYeah. That's what we're made for... You're right. It's important to keep goin'. Thanks.

Woody_011_f8But when a kid outgrows you... it's a big deal, ya know?
}
Woody_009_fnI suppose you're right. Sit with the feelings until you can accept things and eventually move on. Thanks, pal.
u
Woody_003_ffOh, I don't know about that. Kids can be cranky or mischievous, but I think most kids are pretty good.
