Woody_000_f”Every now and then, Buzz and I like to have a little debate. How 'bout givin' your opinion... Which toys are the most fun: cowboys or Space Rangers?

Player_000_choice_000_fCowboys.
)
Player_000_choice_001_fSpace Rangers.
)
Player_000_choice_002_fBoth are good.
^
Woody_001_fOYes! That's what I always say! Now, tell me, which cowboy game's your favorite?
B
Woody_013_f3Dinosaur Rodeo? Rescue the Sheep? Or Old West Town?

Player_001_choice_000_fDinosaur Rodeo.
,
Player_001_choice_001_fRescue the Sheep.
)
Player_001_choice_002_fOld West Town.
b
Woody_004_fSNothin' like a good game of Dinosaur Rodeo. As long as Rex is up for it, of course.
k
Woody_005_f\I saved many a sheep from danger in my day. You would not believe the trouble they got into.
S
Woody_007_fDKidnapped by bandits. Tied to racetracks. Almost eaten by dinosaurs.
V
Woody_008_fGAnd of course, the best part of savin' sheep is it makes Bo Peep happy.
V
Woody_006_fGThere's nothing like a relaxing game of Old West Town after a long day.
]
Woody_014_fNYou have to set up the cardboard box-buildings, sure, but that's half the fun.
c
Woody_009_fTAnd then the sheriff goes around to every building and makes sure everything's okay.
q
Woody_010_fbAnd if that's not interesting enough, the bank usually gets robbed. Can't argue with the classics.
L
Woody_002_f=What?! Seriously?! Who prefers Space Rangers? They're just...
X
Woody_011_fINo. No. I'm past this. I'm not gonna get jealous. It's just... It's fine.
X
Woody_012_fII can accept that you prefer Space Rangers. Every kid has their favorite.

Woody_003_f‚Well, obviously cowboys are good, and I guess Space Rangers are fine, but one of them has to be at least a little more fun. C'mon.
