Woody_006_fŒHey, {PlayerName}, I figured out what happened to the other <ActivityItem>Alien Toys</ActivityItem>. Do you have some time to talk about it?
.
Player_000_choice_000_fTell me everything.
+
Player_000_choice_001_fI'm busy, sorry.
S
Woody_001_fDWell, I tried to track 'em down... but then, I remembered something.
¨
Woody_011_f˜Those little guys have always lived inside that Claw Machine because they could never learn to stop acting like toys around you and the other Villagers.
d
Woody_012_fUBut now, the Claw Machine's broken, and it's my fault they don't have a home anymore.
>
Player_001_choice_000_f#Don't feel bad. It was an accident.
?
Player_001_choice_001_f$I understand. What should we do now?
=
Player_001_choice_002_f"They were squatting in your place.
@
Woody_013_f1I know. I know. But we still gotta make it right.
t
Woody_014_feWe'll have to craft a new <ActivityItem>Claw Machine</ActivityItem>, so they'll have a place to live.
`
Woody_002_fQHere, take the <ActivityItem>Claw Machine Pieces</ActivityItem> you found before.
d
Woody_003_fUOh, and the <ActivityItem>Claw</ActivityItem>. Turns out that thing's indestructible.
â
Woody_000_fÒAnd we'll need a few other things too. I talked to Kristoff, and he said it'd take some <ActivityItem>Hardwood</ActivityItem>, an <ActivityItem>Iron Ingot</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>.
Q
Woody_015_fBNo, no, no. They were more like roommates. Very squeaky roommates.
A
Woody_008_f2Okay. I'll be around whenever you've got a minute.
