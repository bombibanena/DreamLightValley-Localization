Scrooge_000_f\Greetings, {PlayerName}! Looking for your next investment? Well, I have new deals every day!

Scrooge_004_fSActually, I need your help. The Sunlit Plateau is littered with wildebeest bones...
D
Scrooge_007_f3Ahh, and Scar asked you to fix it for him? Typical!
\
Scrooge_008_fKYou know, if you keep doin' every this and that for him, he'll never learn.

Player_001_choice_003_fIt's the last time; I promise.

Player_001_choice_004_fYou're helping me, not him.

Player_001_choice_005_fI don't have a choice.

Scrooge_002_ffWell, fine. I know my business will profit greatly thanks to the new products from the Sunlit Plateau.

Scrooge_006_fnBut Scar needs to learn not to ruin everything and expect someone else to come and solve his problems for him.

Scrooge_005_flHere, this <ActivityItem>Mold</ActivityItem> ought to make your Shovel strong enough to clear out the bones.
V
Scrooge_009_fEWait... how does this work...? Do I need something else to put in it?
v
Scrooge_010_feAye, that you will. But I'm not in the Shovel fixin' business. Maybe Scar can help you with the rest.

Scrooge_003_f™Ah, I suppose you're right. You're doing a favor for the Village, and my business will profit greatly thanks to the new products from the Sunlit Plateau.
