Hades_000_fYou wanted something, Hades?
b
Hades_001_fSI can't believe you've been keeping this fact about myself from me this whole time!
9
Player_000_choice_000_fOookay, let's figure this out.
A
Player_000_choice_001_f&Oh, no way am I dealing with this now.
M
Hades_002_f>What's going on? What have I been apparently keeping from you?
*
Hades_003_fThat here, I'm a CELEBRITY!
'
Player_001_choice_000_f... You are?
-
Player_001_choice_001_fWho told you that?
6
Player_001_choice_002_fI thought you already knew.
S
Hades_004_fDMinnie told me ALL about how here, it's "celebrities" who have fans.
›
Hades_015_f‹But I'll send her a message to <Lore>come to my House</Lore> Ã¢Â€Â” I'm a celebrity and people should come to me, not the other way around!
t
Hades_007_feAnd what these fans want most is to interact with and gain the favor of their favorite "celebrities."
/
Hades_008_f Yeah, that's kinda how it works.
j
Hades_009_f[Well, that explains everything! Nobody's been showing me the proper respect here because...

Hades_010_f%...they don't know me as a celebrity!
v
Hades_011_fgWe need to reframe everything. Which means you Ã¢Â€Â” as my minion Ã¢Â€Â” have got a lot of work to do.
?
Hades_012_f0All right, well I can give you a hand with that.
’
Hades_013_f‚Why don't we <Lore>go talk to Daisy</Lore>? Maybe she can give you some suggestions on how to communicate that you're a celebrity.

Hades_014_frThat could work. I need to up my game Ã¢Â€Â” can't have Jerkules be the only one with his own line of merchandise.

Hades_005_fPHey, I knew people knew me, obviously. Big picture. But not the DETAILS of fame.
