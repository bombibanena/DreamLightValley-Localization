Hades_001_f$Well, that... went. What'd ya think?
6
Player_000_choice_000_fThey were both really good!
4
Player_000_choice_001_fI preferred Eric's flute.
?
Player_000_choice_002_f$I liked Mirabel's vocal melody more.
K
Hades_002_f<Voice and flute seems like a cool pairing for a fancy event!
F
Hades_015_f7So, this "Dee-Jay" has god-like control over the music?
5
Player_001_choice_000_fYou could put it that way.
J
Player_001_choice_001_f/I mean, usually the turntables and mixers help.
D
Player_001_choice_002_f)Oh, totally. You do not mess with the DJ.
T
Hades_003_fEHold on now. I seem to remember being at the same auditions as you...
t
Hades_004_feBut your reaction makes me think you hit your head, passed out, and IMAGINED they were actually GOOD!
\
Hades_009_fMNo way those auditions were right for the electric mood I'm trying to create.
Z
Hades_010_fKBut, if you wanna hire 'em for a children's birthday party, go right ahead!
z
Hades_011_fkWhat am I gonna do? Who can I get to perform? A party isn't a party worth having without top-notch music...
n
Hades_012_f_What if you just find someone to DJ? Then, you could have input on the playlist and everything.
!
Hades_013_f... Dee... Jay...?
º
Hades_014_fªYeah! Think of it as... sort of a modern musician. They usually have a special DJ table with a whole bunch of recorded music. They control what gets played, when and how.
/
Hades_016_f Well now, this is interesting...
8
Hades_017_f)Clearly, I'll be the DJ for my own party!
r
Hades_024_fcHead minion Ã¢Â€Â” <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.
`
Hades_022_fQWhat about Mirabel and Eric? Shall I tell them you're going in another direction?
p
Hades_023_faDon't bother. What can I say? I like the idea of them tearfully waiting for an acceptance letter.
z
Hades_019_fkIntermediate minion Ã¢Â€Â” <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.
w
Hades_020_fhAssociate minion Ã¢Â€Â” <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.
t
Hades_021_feJunior minion Ã¢Â€Â” <Lore>fetch me a DJ table</Lore>! And give it some class. Make it out of marble.

Hades_018_fYeah, yeah. This could work...
l
Hades_005_f]Really, {PlayerName}? I may not be the god of music, but I do have SOME knowledge of culture.
H
Hades_006_f9And that was not it. Sea shanties? What was he thinking?!
k
Hades_007_f\Sure, it was... nice. And it's not her fault, really. But one voice just isn't gonna cut it.
_
Hades_008_fPIf she had, like, four cousins, some killer harmonies and a horn section, maybe.
