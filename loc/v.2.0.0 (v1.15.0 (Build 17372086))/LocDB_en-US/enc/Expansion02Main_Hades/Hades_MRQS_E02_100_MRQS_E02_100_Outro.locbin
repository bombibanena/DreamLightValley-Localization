Hades_001_fbSo, all the trouble around here was caused by those little things I took from the Lorekeeper, huh?
`
Hades_002_fQOh well. I'm back in my throne room and ready to rule over my part of the cosmos!
J
Player_000_choice_000_f/Ready to promote me to CEO of minion resources?
O
Player_000_choice_001_f4Not so fast. You're not going to be ruling anything.
N
Player_000_choice_002_f3I held up my end of the bargain. You hold up yours.
]
Hades_003_fNUh, sure. Now that I'm back on Mount Olympus, call yourself whatever you want.
o
Hades_006_f`Great. Then my first act as CEO will be to request you resolve your little feud with Maleficent.
W
Hades_009_fHRight, right. Maleficent. I almost forgot about her... Wishful thinking.
V
Hades_010_fGOkay, fine. I guess I can put up with having her around occasionally...
*
Hades_011_f...if SHE apologizes to ME!
b
Hades_012_fSI was worried you were going to say that. Maleficent wants YOU to apologize to her.
*
Hades_013_fApologize to HER? For WHAT?
9
Hades_014_f*You know, that lady really has some nerve.
F
Hades_015_f7If I didn't despise her, I'd almost respect it. Almost.
S
Player_001_choice_000_f8Come on, Hades. Tell her you're sorry and let's move on.
X
Player_001_choice_002_f=So you won't apologize to her unless she apologizes to you...
*
Hades_016_fNuh-uh. Not a chance. Nope.
T
Hades_019_fE*sigh* ... So neither of you wants to apologize until the other does.
n
Hades_018_f_You ever hear of something called a Gordian knot? Sounds like you've got yourself one of those.
T
Hades_020_fESeriously, though, I appreciate you getting me back to Mount Olympus.
h
Hades_021_fYI guess I'm going to have to <Lore>talk to the Lorekeeper</Lore> about how to solve this.
J
Hades_017_f;...and she won't apologize to me unless I apologize to her.
a
Hades_022_fRWhy do I get the feeling that Maleficent isn't going to be too eager to apologize?
M
Hades_023_f>Because she's a stubborn snake with an ego bigger than Zeus's?
9
Player_002_choice_000_fAre you describing her or you?
4
Player_002_choice_001_fI mean, you're not wrong.
D
Hades_024_f5Hey! My ego is the exact appropriate size, thank you.
†
Hades_026_fwI guess I'll have to <Lore>explore Everafter to reach Maleficent's castle</Lore> and see if she's willing to apologize.
!
Hades_027_fHere goes nothing.
]
Hades_025_fNTrust me. When you meet Maleficent, you're gonna understand. She's impossible!
L
Hades_004_f=Excuse me? Who put you in charge of who gets to be in charge?
—
Hades_008_f‡I'm the Ruler of the Storybook Vale. It's the only way to resolve your little feud with Maleficent. NEITHER of you get to be in charge.
T
Hades_005_fEOh, right. We had some kind of deal? Gotta say, it's slipped my mind.
v
Hades_007_fgI helped you get back to Mount Olympus. Now YOU need to resolve your silly little feud with Maleficent.
