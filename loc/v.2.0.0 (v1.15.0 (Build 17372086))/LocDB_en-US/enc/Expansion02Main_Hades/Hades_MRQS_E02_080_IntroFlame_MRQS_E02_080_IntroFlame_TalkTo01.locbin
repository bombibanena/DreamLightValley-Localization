Hades_001_f]Okay, okay, {PlayerName}, we need to have a little chat about your so-called job performance.
u
Hades_002_ffI'm STILL not back on Mount Olympus. Which means you're definitely NOT gonna make minion of the month.
E
Player_000_choice_000_f*That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
8
Player_000_choice_001_fI'm working as fast as I can!
;
Player_000_choice_002_f So why don't you do it yourself?
K
Hades_003_f<I think I'm one step closer to getting inside Mount Olympus.
2
Hades_004_f#But I've run into a little problem.
}
Hades_008_fnGood news. Bad news. How's this... I'm empowering you to use that brain of yours to solve that little problem.
:
Player_001_choice_000_fTwo brains are better than one.
\
Player_001_choice_001_fABut you've got such an impressive brain. You could help me a lot!
i
Player_001_choice_002_fNYou know, a good boss is always willing to talk things out with his minions...
‹
Hades_019_f|You'd think, but Pain and Panic have two brains, and they couldn't even manage to take care of Hercules. When he was a BABY!
1
Player_002_choice_000_fThere has to be a way.
P
Player_002_choice_002_f5Is there anything you two DIDN'T mess up around here?
l
Hades_022_f]But fine, I get it. If it's gonna help me get back to Mount Olympus... let's talk it out. Go.
y
Hades_010_fjI found another Mythic Trial. If I could just get inside, I could get us one step closer to Mount Olympus.
d
Hades_011_fUBut there are these blue and green flames scattered around it. I can't get past them.
 
Hades_012_fAh. Right. Those.
E
Hades_013_f6Ya see, Maleficent and I had a little... disagreement.
Q
Hades_014_fBA disagreement that ended with some fireballs being tossed around.
e
Hades_015_fVI tried to get rid of the fire, but since it's got some of Maleficent's magic in it...
*
Hades_016_fNada. Nothin'. Won't budge.
_
Hades_017_fPWell, that Aurora lady... I heard she managed to get rid of a few of the flames.
`
Hades_024_fQHad somethin' to do with a <Lore>Sacred Spring</Lore> filled with magical waters.
;
Hades_025_f,I've looked everywhere, but I can't find it.
n
Hades_026_f_Then I guess we're right back where we started. But maybe <Lore>the Lorekeeper can help</Lore>.
/
Player_003_choice_000_fI'll go talk to her.
7
Player_003_choice_001_fThanks for nothing, I guess.
V
Hades_027_fGSounds like a great idea. Especially since it requires nothing from me.
|
Hades_030_fm<Lore>Have a schmooze with that tattered old book</Lore> and you'll have me back on Mount Olympus in no time!
S
Hades_028_fDHey! The best managers don't solve their minions' problems for them.
‹
Hades_029_f|Figuring this out yourself is the only way you can learn and grow. Ugh. That made me a little sick just saying it. Anyway...
b
Hades_018_fSPoint taken. BUT, a good minion focuses on solutions, not problems. Let me think...
.
Hades_020_fOkay, okay, you've got a point.
f
Hades_023_fWIf it's gonna help put me back on Mount Olympus, let's talk it out. What's the problem?
$
Hades_021_fAll right, all right.
#
Hades_005_fOh, I'd be happy to.
q
Hades_006_fbIf it weren't for all that ink blocking the way that only YOUR little magic tricks can get rid of!
G
Hades_007_f8Well, that's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
