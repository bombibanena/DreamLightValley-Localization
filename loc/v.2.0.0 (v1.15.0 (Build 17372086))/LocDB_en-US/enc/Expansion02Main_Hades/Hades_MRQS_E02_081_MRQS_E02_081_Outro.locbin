Hades_019_f…Take my word for it, kid. You're a great contributor. Don't be too eager to get into management. You would not believe the headaches!
g
Hades_001_fXNow, it looks like the rest of the torches around the gate to Mount Olympus have lit up!
L
Hades_002_f=And since you already cleared all the ink blocking the way...
}
Hades_003_fnIt's time to head inside the palace on Mount Olympus. Which is great! Don't get me wrong. Except for the mess.
P

G
Hades_008_f8Try <Lore>investigating the Colossus</Lore> to the west.
g
Hades_009_fXYou'll have to start by <Lore>clearing away all the ink</Lore> around the place, though.
‰
Hades_010_fzYou already cleared away the ink blocking <Lore>the Colossus</Lore>. So try looking around there for another Mythic Trial.
m
Hades_020_f^Ambition noted, but you gotta start small and work your way up. It's business; what can I say?
W
Hades_021_fH*sigh* Look, fine. At your next annual review, we can talk title change.
O
Hades_022_f@Flunky, lackey, henchperson, whatever. We'll work something out.
@
Hades_011_f1Tell you what. I think it's time for a promotion.
H
Hades_013_f9I'm moving you up from junior minion to associate minion.

Player_000_choice_000_f#Do I have any new responsibilities?

Player_000_choice_001_fWill there be a pay increase?
6
Player_000_choice_002_fI'm not your minion, Hades.
O
Hades_015_f@Obviously. I expect you to work at least twice as hard. Minimum.
Z
Hades_016_fKYeah, afraid not. But really, you're in this for the experience, aren't ya?

Hades_017_f*With that attitude, you won't be for long.
