Player_000_choice_000_fThat was kinda brutal.
F
Player_000_choice_001_f+I guess you need a little more DJ practice?
V
Player_000_choice_002_f;I hope you have a more accurate view of your DJ skills now.
E
Hades_004_f6I feel like I just went five rounds with Wonder Boy...
Š
Hades_013_f{The mistake I made was doing anything for you mortals in the first place. Artists perform FOR ME! Not the other way around.
5
Player_001_choice_000_fAh, so we learned nothing.
S

R
Hades_007_fCYou sure you don't want to try again? Maybe with a simpler concept?
T

g
Hades_017_fXI... I just gotta go back to doin' what I do best Ã¢Â€Â” brimstone, souls and suffering!
>
Hades_019_f/Let's just forget about this whole thing, okay?
Y
Hades_021_fJStill, you were a good head minion. You get the whole beck and call thing.
J
Hades_023_f;So here Ã¢Â€Â” a little reward for not totally screwing up.
"
Hades_024_fAww, thanks, Hades!
Z
Hades_025_fKYeah, yeah, you're not worthy, you bow before me, I've heard it all before.
b
Hades_026_fSNow maybe I can modify that Lightning Generator to REALLY put out some big bolts...
¥
Hades_015_f•Nice. Thank you. I happened to forget for one moment that all the other gods get the parties and the entertainment, and YOU have to go and remind me!
