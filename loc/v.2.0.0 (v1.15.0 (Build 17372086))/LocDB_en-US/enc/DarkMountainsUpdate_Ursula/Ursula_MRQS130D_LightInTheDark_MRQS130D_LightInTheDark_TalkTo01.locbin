Ursula_000_fnAngelfish, have you finally come to ask for my help dealing with all that trouble in the sky? It's about time!

Player_001_choice_000_fYou have a beautiful voice.
;
Player_001_choice_001_f Nobody's better at making deals.
I
Player_001_choice_002_f.I'm afraid of you... but in, like, a good way!
+
Player_001_choice_003_fNo deal, Ursula.
?
Ursula_008_f/You're right. I do need your help. Take a look.
6
Ursula_003_f&What is this rubble you're handing me?
c
Ursula_004_fSIf you're looking to trade, you'll need to find something far better than all this.
œ
Ursula_005_f‹I found those <ActivityItem>Beach Toys</ActivityItem> in the same cave that I freed you from. I think they used to belong to the Forgotten.
Y
Ursula_006_fIDo you remember them? These might be the key to saving Dreamlight Valley.
L
Ursula_007_f<Hmm... Now that you mention it, they do look a tad familiar.
·
Ursula_009_f¦I'll tell you about them... and all it'll cost you is a simple commendation. I hear everyone else around here are receiving them. Don't I deserve some accolades, too?
R
Ursula_010_fBI do, don't I? Remind me to serenade you sometime, free of charge.
V
Ursula_014_fFNow then... Those trinkets... You used to play with them as a child...
"
Ursula_015_f... You and Moana.

Ursula_002_f$Moana? But she's not in the Village.
Š
Ursula_020_fzWell, then to have any hope of saving the Valley, you'll have to <Lore>find her and bring her back here</Lore>, won't you?
X
Ursula_021_fHI suspect the answers lie behind one of those doors in the Dream Castle.
E
Ursula_001_f5Moana? Of course. I'll go <Lore>talk to Moana</Lore>.
t
Ursula_018_fdAnd {PlayerName}? When you find the Forgotten and stop this little scheme, tell them to come see me.
M
Ursula_019_f=I can teach them a thing or two about getting what they want.
C
Ursula_011_f3And don't you forget it. I always comes out on top.
o
Ursula_012_f_Ha! Well, if you can't be loved, at least make sure you're feared; that's always worked for me.
\
Ursula_013_fLUgh. Of course. You can't even spare a kind word for me to save the Village.
z
Ursula_016_fjIf the whole Village falls apart, there won't be anybody around here to make deals with. Spill it, Ursula.
(
Ursula_017_fOh, fine. I may as well.
