Oswald_001_fmHey, Oswald! I'm checking in with everyone that Jafar dealt with. How has he been around you since the trial?
5
Oswald_011_f%Well, that's surprisingly reassuring.
H
Oswald_002_f8How do, {PlayerName}! And, actually, Jafar's been swell!
b
Oswald_004_fRWell, that's good to hear, I suppose. What kind of nice actions has he been doing?
d
Oswald_006_fTWell, he brought me a gift Ã¢Â€Â” a set of tools for Trolley repair and maintenance!
<
Oswald_008_f,Oh, that's actually very considerate of him.
O
Oswald_009_f?Yeah! He apologized for before and said that he liked my style.
Q
Oswald_010_fAAnd that the <Lore>traditional</Lore> look was always in fashion.
y
Oswald_000_fiYou know, after hearing what everyone has told me... I think that maybe we should do something for Jafar.
!
Oswald_013_fThat idea's tops!
V
Oswald_014_fFIt's clear that Jafar is trying to ingratiate himself to everyone now.
M
Oswald_015_f=We should do something to show that we appreciate his effort.

Oswald_016_fHmm...
z
Oswald_017_fjLet's see... He did kinda show his own interests with his gift choices Ã¢Â€Â” we should use that to start!
Á
Oswald_018_f°I've got it! We'll decorate around the Palace with furniture that's <Lore>Red</Lore>, <Lore>Black</Lore>, <Lore>Elegant</Lore>, <Lore>Bold</Lore>, and <Lore>Traditional</Lore>!
\
Oswald_019_fLMaybe I should talk to Merlin to get a little something extra special too...
P
Oswald_012_f@Thanks Oswald; I think you've made things way more clear for me.
