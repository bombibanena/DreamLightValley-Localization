Maui_007_feHey, {PlayerName}! How can I help you today? Got a giant crab bothering you? Want me to lasso a star?
o
Player_000_f_You're a shapeshifter, right? Ariel needs a way to turn back and forth from human to mermaid...
/
Player_000_choice_003_fCan you teach Ariel?
,
Player_000_choice_004_fHow does it work?
<
Player_000_choice_005_f!How common is this kind of magic?
i

Maui_000_f[Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on. I CAN shapeshift but only because of the power of my magic hook.
Y

Maui_001_fKAnd before you ask, no, you can't borrow it. Magic hooks are very personal.
Œ

Maui_002_f~You could try creating an enchanted object yourself. I mean, you're full of Dreamlight magic, right? Who knows. It could work.
-
Player_000_choice_000_fYes, I'll do that!

Player_000_choice_001_fWould it be that simple?
<
Player_000_choice_002_f!I'm not sure I'm powerful enough.

Maui_003_f)That's what I like to hear, {PlayerName}!


Maui_010_fYou've got this.
Z

Maui_006_fLOkay, so if I'm going to help Ariel and Eric... I need to enchant something.
}

Maui_013_foI'll need something with Dreamlight magic in it. Maybe some <ActivityItem>Purified Night Shards</ActivityItem>.
Ê

Maui_017_f»But if I'm going to be messing with Dreamlight magic, I'll need something to ground the spell, something from the earth. Maybe some <ActivityItem>White Impatiens</ActivityItem> flowers...
R

Maui_018_fD... Oh, and a <ActivityItem>Vial</ActivityItem> to mix it all up in!
s

Maui_019_feSounds like Merlin's rubbing off on you, kid. You're definitely getting the hang of this magic stuff.
‡

Maui_014_fyOf course, once you've got all that junk, you'll need something to enchant. Maybe Eric can help you figure that part out.
>

Maui_015_f0Have a good time enchanting stuff, {PlayerName}!
T

Maui_004_fFSimple? No, it won't be simple. But if anyone can manage it, it's you.
z

Maui_005_flHey, I didn't defeat a giant crab by doubting myself. It's a challenge, {PlayerName}. A part of your legend.
