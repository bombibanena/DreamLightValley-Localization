Merlin_013_fJEverything in Dreamlight Valley is made of, well, <Lore>Dreamlight</Lore>!
g
Merlin_014_fWIt's the sparkles you see over everything and everyone... even a wizard such as myself!
n
Merlin_015_f^But <Lore>Dreamlight</Lore> became scarcer and scarcer as the Forgetting fell over the Valley.
S
Merlin_005_fCEver since you arrived, though, the magic has started to come back!
-
Player_000_fThe magic is connected to me?
3
Player_000_choice_000_fI have to use it wisely.
6
Player_000_choice_001_fI want to make it stronger.
7
Player_000_choice_002_fI don't feel very magical...
S
Merlin_007_fCAnd as long as you keep that wish in your heart, you need not fear.
ø
Merlin_016_fÆ<Lore>Dreamlight Magic</Lore> grows stronger through <Lore>acts of friendship, love, and care</Lore>. Simple acts, like removing Night Thorns or forging a friendship with me.
z
Merlin_018_fjGaze into the Well, and you'll discover the different tasks that will create more <Lore>Dreamlight</Lore>.
î
Merlin_000_fÉAnd since you already found all the <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem>, the Wishing Well is reacting to your newfound powers!
n
Merlin_012_f^But we should start simply. <Lore>Look into the Well</Lore> to find out what the Valley needs.
^
Merlin_019_fNEven the simplest tasks will bring great change and help end the Forgetting...
W
Merlin_023_fG...as long as they're done in the spirit of friendship, love, and care.
Ñ
Merlin_017_ftNow, once you've gathered enough Dreamlight to remove those horrid Night Thorns from the Castle, come find me again.
´
Merlin_008_föBut to fully embrace the potential of Dreamlight, you'll need to gather the <ActivityItem>Royal Tools</ActivityItem> that were lost during the Forgetting.
Å
Merlin_002_fqRemember: For some wizards, magic requires magical implements. You'll need those tools to save Dreamlight Valley.
¢
Merlin_003_fëLet's see... fishing... fishing... Ah yes! Goofy is very fond of fishing! He's sure to know where you can find the lost <Lore>Fishing Rod</Lore>.
{
Merlin_006_fkThough, I haven't heard from him since the stones blocked our path to the <Lore>Meadow to the south</Lore>.
<
Merlin_004_f,Well, you must find him, so I'd start there.
Ø
Merlin_001_fûMickey's been the gardener in the Village since the Forgetting. Perhaps he knows the whereabouts of the <Lore>Watering Can</Lore> and the <Lore>Shovel</Lore>.
Z
Merlin_021_fJAll right. But it's not through the desire for power that the magic grows.
P
Merlin_022_f@Oh, it's not all about magic words and casting spells, you know.
