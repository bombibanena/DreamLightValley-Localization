Merlin_002_f%Hey, Merlin, I was wondering ifÃ¢Â€Â”
<
Merlin_000_f,If I want to join Stitch's musical ensemble?
H
Merlin_001_f8Remember, {PlayerName}: I've already been to the future.
[
Merlin_003_fKAnd Stitch's band is something the blasted Forgetting didn't let me forget.
M
Merlin_004_f=Yeah, you got it. Stitch wants to play music for the Village.

Player_000_choice_000_fYou could sing?

Player_000_choice_001_fYou could shake a tambourine?
K
Player_000_choice_002_f0You could do an enchantment to keep him in tune?
Š
Merlin_005_fzWell, I have been known to warble a tune or two, but I'm not sure I'd be right for the kind of music Stitch wants to make.
ˆ
Merlin_008_fxDo let me know when the first performance will be, though, won't you? I'm quite intrigued by this "rock and roll music."
S
Merlin_009_fCWhy, it seems almost as ingenious an innovation as indoor plumbing.
e
Merlin_006_fUThat hardly sounds like the best use of my time with all that's going on around here.
z
Merlin_007_fjI'm not sure that's the wisest use of magic. And besides, if I did, Stitch would never improve his skills.
