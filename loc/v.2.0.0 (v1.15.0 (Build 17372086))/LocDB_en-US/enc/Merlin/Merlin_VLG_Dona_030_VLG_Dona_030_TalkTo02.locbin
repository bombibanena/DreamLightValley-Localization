Merlin_000_fiI hear you might know how to open the <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem> that Donald and I dug up?
X
Merlin_005_fHI ought to know how to open it. I'm the one who enchanted it, after all!
*
Merlin_002_fPerfect! So what's inside?
y
Merlin_012_fiNow hold on! Just because I know how to open it, doesn't mean I'm going to go to all that trouble myself.
i
Merlin_013_fYBut I'd be happy to tell you how to do it. I found all the details in one of my journals.

Merlin_015_fñThe <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem> will only open if it's presented with precisely the right scent. Quite ingenious, if I do say so myself!
;
Merlin_017_f+The right scent, huh? Hope it's a good one.
n
Merlin_004_f^Take this recipe and find out. It has everything you need to produce just the right fragrance.

Merlin_001_fmOnce you have this mixed together, come see me and we'll open that <ActivityItem>Time Capsule</ActivityItem>!
