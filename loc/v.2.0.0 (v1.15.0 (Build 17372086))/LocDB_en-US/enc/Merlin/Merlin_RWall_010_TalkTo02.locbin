Merlin_000_fCWALLÂ·E? Hmm... Ah, yes, I remember now! A charming little robot.
d
Merlin_002_fTHe seemed rather happy in the Valley before. I suppose you must first win his trust.

X
Merlin_001_fHYes! Plants are one of the many things that WALLÂ·E enjoys collecting!
G
Merlin_004_f7Talk to Scrooge McDuck. He's a collector too, you know.
[
Merlin_005_fKHe might have some bits and baubles around that you can bring to WALLÂ·E.
T
Merlin_009_fDWho knows? Maybe Mr. McDuck's trash can become WALLÂ·E's treasure!

Merlin_006_fUYes, well, that is his profession, but I don't think it's what he's passionate about.
f
Merlin_007_fVConsider bringing him things he might treasure... even if they seem like trash to you.
