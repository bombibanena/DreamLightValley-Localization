Merlin_000_fW{PlayerName}! So all this Dark Magic is Mother Gothel's doing, eh? I should have known.
4
Player_000_choice_003_fShe didn't mean to do it!
8
Player_000_choice_004_fWe better keep an eye on her.
2
Player_000_choice_005_fHow do we fix all this?
w
Merlin_004_fgIf you meddle in Dark Magic, you have to expect the unexpected. Mother Gothel should have known better.
·
Merlin_003_f¦Most of the Villagers are stuck in their Houses by this blasted curse. Ursula and I were able to break free only because we cast some magic of our own to ward it off.
w
Merlin_008_fgTo break this curse, we'll have to restore the Pillar of Trust... but that may come at a terrible cost.
~
Merlin_001_fnI know of a spell that could work, but it's dangerous. It demands sacrifices you may not be willing to make...
«
Merlin_009_fšThe spell will take you to another place... somewhere between <Lore>Here and There</Lore>, where the <ActivityItem>Orb of Trust</ActivityItem> was hidden.
O
Merlin_006_f?It's not easy to get to, and it's dangerous to get stuck there.

Player_000_choice_000_fWhat is the Here and There?
7
Player_000_choice_001_fWill I be able to come back?
-
Player_000_choice_002_fWhat is the spell?
@
Merlin_010_f0It's a place between worlds, made of pure magic.
_
Merlin_013_fOIn the <Lore>Here and There</Lore>, the laws that govern our world don't apply.
T
Merlin_014_fDOne may pass through things and see things that shouldn't be seen...
E
Merlin_015_f5One might even take a leap of faith, and walk on air!
Œ
Merlin_011_f|But usually, things or people that go to the <Lore>Here and There</Lore> never come back to tell tales of what they've seen.
{
Merlin_012_fkThe magic of the Pillar of Trust made whole again should be enough to summon you back to Dreamlight Valley.
E
Merlin_002_f5We'll just have to hope the Sea Witch can be trusted.
x
Merlin_007_fhOne for which <Lore>you'll need Ursula's help</Lore>. I'm afraid this type of magic is not my specialty.
‹
Merlin_005_f{Oh, I'll be watching Mother Gothel. The last thing we need around here is someone mucking about with curses and Dark Magic.
"
Merlin_016_fSplendid question!
