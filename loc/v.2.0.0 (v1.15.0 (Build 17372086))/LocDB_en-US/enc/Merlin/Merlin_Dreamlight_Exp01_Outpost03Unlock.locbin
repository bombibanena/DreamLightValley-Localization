l
Merlin_008_f\When you do, you can explore another area of Ancient's Landing... the <Lore>Overlook</Lore>!
~
Player_000_choice_000_fcI'll channel the magic of the Hourglass... (Use {UpgradePrice} <sprite="iconCurrencyMist" index=0>)

Player_000_choice_001_fI'm not quite ready yet...
{
Merlin_001_fkMarvelous! Soon, you'll be exploring the Overlook! I suspect there are ancient mysteries to be found there.
x
Merlin_011_fhGoodness, I'm afraid you don't have enough <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> to mend this Time Rift yet.
ò
Merlin_002_fáRemember... the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> is <Lore>connected to the magic of your Hourglass and to Eternity Isle itself</Lore>.
∑
Merlin_012_f¶You must keep uncovering wonders with your Hourglass and continue to make Eternity Isle a home. As you do, you'll gain the <ActivityItem>Mist</ActivityItem> required!
O
Merlin_009_f?Yes, yes... But don't take too long. There is much to discover!
@
Merlin_003_f0These <Lore>Time Rifts</Lore> are quite curious.
Y

Player_001_choice_000_fHow do we fix it?
I
Player_001_choice_001_f.So you're telling me I SHOULDN'T jump into it?
m
Merlin_005_f]Perhaps there's some way to fix this. But I'm afraid, for now, this requires more research...
c
Merlin_010_fSWell, that depends. Are you eager to be completely rearranged at a molecular level?
$
Player_002_choice_000_f	Er... no.

Player_002_choice_001_fIt does sound intriguing.
$
Merlin_013_fHmm... are you sure?
k
Merlin_015_f[It could be a marvelous learning opportunity. Though I suppose the risks are significant...

Merlin_014_fDoesn't it?!
