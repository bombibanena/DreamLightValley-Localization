Beast_000_fçOkay, let's review what we saw in the mirror: Belle surrounded by lots of loose paper with... writing all over it. The pages were everywhere!

Beast_001_f!I think Belle is writing stories!
W

Player_000_choice_001_fHow about an enchanted folder?
5
Player_000_choice_002_fWho knew she was so messy?

Beast_004_fPlease... Don't.
#
Beast_006_fIt was a great joke!
,
Beast_007_fHmph. What we need is a gift.
'
Beast_012_fYou must have some idea.
•
Beast_011_fïWhat about... a journal with a quill and some ink? A nice <ActivityItem>Book Kit</ActivityItem>. That way she can write her stories all in one place.
+
Beast_013_fThat would be perfect but...
K
Beast_014_f<...I wouldn't know where to find those things in the castle.

m
Beast_026_f^Yes! Just... think about it, okay? I'll go make Belle's <ActivityItem>Book Kit</ActivityItem>.

Beast_016_fReally?
G
Beast_017_f8Manners matter! You've been pretty blunt with me so far.

Beast_018_fYou sound like Mrs. Potts.
K
Beast_019_f<*sigh* Will you help me get this gift for Belle? ... Please.
 
Beast_020_fOf course I will!
H
Beast_003_f9... A folder? Is that something that would be... special?
@
Beast_008_f1We can probably find something more thoughtful...
5
Beast_005_f&She isn't. Usually, I'm the messy one.
9
Beast_009_f*Your room COULD use a little tidying up...
M
