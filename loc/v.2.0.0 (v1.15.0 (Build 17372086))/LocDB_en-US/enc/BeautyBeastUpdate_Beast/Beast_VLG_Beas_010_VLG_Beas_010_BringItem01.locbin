?
Player_000_choice_001_f$You're stressing again Ã¢Â€Â” relax!
.

6
Beast_003_f'No. It's my fault for agreeing to this.
A


Beast_013_f...

Beast_014_fPlease help.
b
Beast_015_fSHmmm, I'll have to think about that... There are so many options around the Valley!
*
Beast_016_fPerhaps somewhere outdoors?
x
Beast_017_fiSomewhere we could look out onto the horizon and think about our time together. What our future could be.
?

X
Player_001_choice_001_f=Who is this suave prince and what did you do with the Beast?!

Beast_005_f#What if she doesn't enjoy the food?

Beast_006_frWhat if... what if she's changed since coming here? Learned new things, found new dreams... while I'm still... me.
'
Beast_007_fBeast, you're spiraling.
'
Beast_008_fDo you care about Belle?

Beast_009_fOf course I do!
Q

M
Beast_019_f>Now... are there any particular foods that Belle really likes?
\
Beast_020_fMWell... I know of a few dishes that Belle would often ask my chef to prepare.
k
Beast_021_f\Here are the recipes. Some of them may require using utensils, which are difficult for me...

Beast_022_fBut I will try!
<
Beast_023_f-These recipes look perfect for a dinner date!
k
Beast_024_f\Don't worry about the cooking. I'll make sure they're ready for when you meet up with Belle.
[
Beast_025_fLWe can meet again in the evening if the weather is good for sitting outside.
