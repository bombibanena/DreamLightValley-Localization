Beast_000_f"Hey, you're looking chipper today!
H
Beast_001_f9It is a pleasant day. It's nice to see you, {PlayerName}.
A
Beast_002_f2Well, that's a lovely change! What's on your mind?
R
Beast_003_fCI have an idea for a project of sorts. Do you think you could help?
 
Player_000_choice_000_fSure!
H
Player_000_choice_001_f-Not at the moment, but I can come back later!

Beast_004_f
Thank you.
'
Beast_005_fSo what's this big idea?
ç
Beast_006_f~I've noticed something missing from the Valley √¢¬Ä¬î there are many lovely flowers here, but one important flower is missing.
"
Beast_007_fThere are no roses.
I
Player_001_choice_000_f.You're right; I've never realized that before!
M
Player_001_choice_001_f2Yeah, it's been bugging me that we don't have any.
Y
Beast_008_fJBut Beast... I'd have thought with your history with the enchanted rose...
*
Beast_009_fThat I might not like them?
#
Player_002_choice_000_fExactly!
7
Player_002_choice_001_fThat's putting it lightly...
S
Beast_010_fDWell, yes... There is one rose that is difficult for me to speak of.
ì
Beast_011_fÉBut ever since Belle came into my life, roses have changed from a symbol of my misfortune to a symbol of what's growing between us.
.
Player_003_choice_000_fThat's so romantic!
F
Player_003_choice_001_f+That's very... emotionally balanced of you.
$
Beast_012_fI... I suppose it is.
/
Beast_013_f So what do you need my help for?
V
Beast_014_fGWell, I was speaking with Kristoff and... communicating with WALL√Ç¬∑E.
o
Beast_015_f`It seems that the best way to ensure that roses grow well here is to start them in a greenhouse.
7
Beast_016_f(Ahh, and you need my building expertise?
w
Beast_017_fhYes. I tried to begin building one myself, but well... my paws are too large for the fine work required.
ñ
Beast_018_fÜKristoff helped by telling me what is needed for a greenhouse √¢¬Ä¬î <ActivityItem>Glass</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Dry Wood</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Gold Ingots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Crystal</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Soil</ActivityItem>.
t
Beast_019_feAnd please, take this frame for the greenhouse √¢¬Ä¬î Kristoff was able to help me with that as well.
,
Beast_020_fDon't worry √¢¬Ä¬î I'm on it.
2
Beast_021_f#It is? That... that's good to hear.

Beast_022_fI will be here.
