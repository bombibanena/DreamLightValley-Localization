Scrooge_000_fRMr. McDuck, I'd love to hear your opinion. What do you think of these new statues?
y
Scrooge_001_fhThey're pleasant enough. But if they'd had a more inspiring model, I'd be happy to stock 'em in my shop!
h
Scrooge_002_fWWasn't there a god who threw lightning bolts? I think the Lorekeeper told me about him.
O
Scrooge_003_f>Aye, lass. That'd be Zeus! He'd make a much more regal figure.
`
Scrooge_004_fOShame this one doesn't have real lightning. That'd make it heaps more exciting!
W
Scrooge_005_fFHmm, wasn't there a lightning machine not too far from the Lorekeeper?
