MotherGothel_008_f	It's you!

Player_001_choice_000_fHave we met before?

Player_001_choice_001_fWho trapped you in here?

Player_001_choice_002_f$The Dark Magic is gone. You're free!

MotherGothel_005_fWhy, you look just like...
O
MotherGothel_013_f9No, my mistake. It must be your dreadfully ordinary face.
k
MotherGothel_014_fUHah! I'm just teasing. Don't take everything so seriously. I'm very happy to see you.

Player_004_f The Ruler locked you up in here?

Player_004_choice_000_fWhy?
5
Player_004_choice_002_fThere must be some reason.
4
Player_004_choice_003_fYou probably deserved it.
f
MotherGothel_031_fPOh, fine, I'll admit it. I may have been fiddling with a tiny bit of Dark Magic!
q
MotherGothel_032_f[I was merely trying to concoct a curse that would keep someone locked away, safe and sound.
\
MotherGothel_033_fFAfter all, why bother with a secret tower when you can just use magic?

Player_000_choice_005_fHow do I fix it?
U
MotherGothel_034_f?Now, I'll confess, the spell may have gotten a bit out of hand.
Ö
MotherGothel_039_foSome might even say it was threatening to destroy the whole Valley. I suppose I don't know my own strength! Ha!
p
MotherGothel_035_fZWell, that's when our Ruler decided to turn the spell back on me and lock me away in here.
m
MotherGothel_038_fWNow, as much as I appreciate you freeing me, I'm afraid you've made a dreadful mistake.
*
MotherGothel_026_fWhat do you mean...?
K
MotherGothel_021_f5You see, just as I was trapped in here by my curse...
?
MotherGothel_023_f)...the curse was trapped in here with me.
î
MotherGothel_024_f~Now that you've freed me, <Lore>you've unleashed my Dark Magic on the whole Village</Lore>. Tsk, tsk. What a mess you've made!
9
MotherGothel_027_f#I know, darling. It's truly tragic.
ù
MotherGothel_030_fÜBut if we can restore the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> to the Pillar of Trust, it just might get rid of all this pesky Dark Magic.
r
MotherGothel_040_f\And aren't you lucky? I happen to know where the <ActivityItem>Orb</ActivityItem> is hidden!
8
Player_000_choice_000_fWill you tell me where it is?
:
Player_000_choice_001_fTell me. Now. Before I get mad.
9
Player_000_choice_002_fI helped you. Now you help me.
6
MotherGothel_003_f Oh, I adore your manners, child.
R
MotherGothel_018_f<Since you're so polite, I'll let you in on my little secret.
õ
MotherGothel_016_fÑTo draw on the Dark Magic I needed to create my curse, I had to rip the <ActivityItem>Orb of Trust</ActivityItem> out of the Pillar.
D
MotherGothel_006_f.Come quickly. Let's go to the Pillar of Trust.
3
MotherGothel_004_fTsk, tsk, tsk. Manners, dear.
p
MotherGothel_022_fZYou'll soon learn I don't take kindly to rudeness. But just this once, I'll forgive you...
U
MotherGothel_017_f?It's the Sea Witch who loves to cut a bargain, my dear. Not me.
S
MotherGothel_025_f=But since you helped me, I'll let you in on my little secret.
E
MotherGothel_028_f/My fault?! You're the one who lifted the curse!
-
MotherGothel_029_fWell, it won't be easy.
~
MotherGothel_037_fhEvil? Don't be so melodramatic, dear. Just because I meddle with Dark Magic, that doesn't mean I'm evil!
<
MotherGothel_010_f&Well, you're a feisty one, aren't you?
k
MotherGothel_011_fUDon't you know? Our kind and gracious Ruler, of course. It seems like eons ago now...
Ç
MotherGothel_012_flThank goodness! After our miserable Ruler locked me away in here, I thought I'd never be free of this place.
