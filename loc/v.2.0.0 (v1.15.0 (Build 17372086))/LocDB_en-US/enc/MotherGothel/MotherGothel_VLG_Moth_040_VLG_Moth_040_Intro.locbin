MotherGothel_011_fπ{PlayerName}, it took me HOURS of work, tireless research, and an uninvited visit to Merlin's library, but I've finally learned how to restore the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>.
*
Player_002_choice_000_fHow can I help?
;
Player_002_choice_004_f No. Not helping you right now...
8
MotherGothel_002_f"I'll get to that, you can be sure.
Ä
MotherGothel_005_fjOh, how lucky you are that I'm here, {PlayerName}. Someone less... gifted would never have figured it out.
k
MotherGothel_000_fUIt's only because of me that there's hope of restoring the Giant Willow in the Glade.
.
Player_001_choice_000_fBelieve me, I know!
1
Player_001_choice_001_fWhat did you discover?
.
Player_001_choice_002_fGet to the point...
?
MotherGothel_010_f)And that's why you're my favorite. Now...
Ã
MotherGothel_012_fµNeither the <ActivityItem>Sun's Scroll</ActivityItem>, nor the symbols in the Mystical Cave said anything about how to put the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem> back together...
à
MotherGothel_001_frOr what to do in case of dimmed <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem>. But did I let that stop me? Of course not.
ó
MotherGothel_003_fÄI discovered that the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>'s heart must be made of a piece of the sun. So that is what we need.
8
Player_000_choice_012_fAm I going to fly to the sun?
.
Player_000_choice_017_fHow do we get that?
[
Player_000_choice_018_f@On the sun, the floor is LITERALLY lava. I'm not going up there.
S
MotherGothel_017_f=Don't be ridiculous, dear. We're going to make it come to us.
t
MotherGothel_020_f^I've uncovered a spell that calls for a shower of <ActivityItem>Sun Meteorites</ActivityItem>.
ê
MotherGothel_018_fzBut first, we need to restore the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem>. I can't call for the shower without their power.
N
Player_000_choice_019_f3I'm going to make so many wishes during the shower!
(
Player_000_choice_020_fWhat do I do?
a
Player_000_choice_021_fFI hope no <ActivityItem>Sun Meteorites</ActivityItem> fall on my head.
Y
MotherGothel_023_fCEh-eh-eh. Priorities, {PlayerName}. We must ensure that it happens.
V
MotherGothel_021_f@We'll start with the <ActivityItem>Dawn Fragment</ActivityItem>.
ç
MotherGothel_027_fwTo be restored, it must be infused with Ingredients as fresh as the morning to "remind" it of its nature and awaken it.
«
MotherGothel_006_f∞You'll have to gather <ActivityItem>Lemon</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Oregano</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Mint</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>Ocean Water</ActivityItem>.
ê
MotherGothel_007_fzThen, submerge the <ActivityItem>Dawn Fragment</ActivityItem> in a pot with these Ingredients like you would for any meal.
C
MotherGothel_008_f-Return to me the moment that you've finished.
A
MotherGothel_024_f+Wouldn't that be a sight to see? For now...
C
MotherGothel_019_f-And no one said that you would, {PlayerName}.
B
MotherGothel_013_f,Always so dreadfully direct, {PlayerName}...
P
MotherGothel_009_f:Another disappointment... I should be used to this by now.
p
MotherGothel_014_fZVery well. When you decide the fate of your Village is important, I'll be here... waiting.
