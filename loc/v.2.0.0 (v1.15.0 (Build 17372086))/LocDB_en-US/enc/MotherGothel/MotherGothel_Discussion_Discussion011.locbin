MotherGothel_000_fÇ{PlayerName}, I feel that I must share a bit of my knowledge of the world, so you have a chance to survive out here on your own...
à
MotherGothel_001_frNow, you must have noticed the flowers growing around the Village. So beautiful and majestic... like me! Ha-ha-ha!
*
Player_000_choice_000_fI love flowers!
+
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat about them?
*
Player_000_choice_002_fUgh, flowers...
?
MotherGothel_002_f)Of course you do. After all, who doesn't?

MotherGothel_005_fbYou must remember that every part of the Valley is home to one or two specific types of flowers...
Ô
MotherGothel_009_fÿIn the Plaza, you'll find <ActivityItem>Dandelions</ActivityItem>, a common, charmless weed that reminds me a little of you! Ha-ha, only kidding, dear. But also <ActivityItem>Penstemons</ActivityItem> of many colors.
õ
MotherGothel_010_fÑIf you want <ActivityItem>Rising Penstemons</ActivityItem> or <ActivityItem>Daisies</ActivityItem>, you'll have to go to the Meadow.
´
MotherGothel_011_fîSome flowers even grow on the sand of Dazzle Beach. <ActivityItem>Hydrangeas</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Sunflowers</ActivityItem> to be exact.
´
MotherGothel_012_fîIf ever you need <ActivityItem>Bell Flowers</ActivityItem> or <ActivityItem>Star Lilies</ActivityItem>, look under the trees in the Forest of Valor.
ä
MotherGothel_013_ft<ActivityItem>Bromeliads</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Houseleeks</ActivityItem> grow only on the Sunlit Plateau.
¡
MotherGothel_008_f™For example, if you visit my beloved Glade, you'll find all sorts of <ActivityItem>Marsh Milkweed</ActivityItem>. White, orange, purple, blue... Almost a rainbow of them.
Û
MotherGothel_014_f‹If you feel brave enough to explore the Forgotten Lands, you can gather <ActivityItem>Impatiens</ActivityItem> and <ActivityItem>Nasturtiums</ActivityItem>. Appropriately named flowers for that ugly place, if you ask me.
©
MotherGothel_015_fíBut only one type of flower grows in the Frosted Heights √¢¬Ä¬î the <ActivityItem>Passion Lily</ActivityItem>. Though it does come in many colors.
è
MotherGothel_003_fyWell, I know how children are, so I feel it needs to be said... Try not to eat them. It wouldn't be good for you. Also...
T
MotherGothel_004_f>{PlayerName}, you really don't have an eye for beauty, do you?
L
MotherGothel_006_f6Oh well, not everyone can appreciate the finer things.
Å
MotherGothel_007_fkStill, you should remember that every part of the Valley is home to one or two specific types of flowers...
