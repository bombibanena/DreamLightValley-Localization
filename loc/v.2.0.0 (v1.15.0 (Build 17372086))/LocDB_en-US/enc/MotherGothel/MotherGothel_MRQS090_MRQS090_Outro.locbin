MotherGothel_007_f@That's right. You always were the rightful ruler of this Valley.
ù
MotherGothel_010_fÜLong ago, <Lore>you reigned over these lands.</Lore> It was prosperous enough, I suppose, and you made a ridiculous number of friends.

MotherGothel_011_fjBut then, <Lore>you started to change...</Lore> And, one day √¢¬Ä¬î poof! You disappeared without a trace.

MotherGothel_012_fiWhile you were gone, something evil started to grow and grow until it caused <Lore>the Forgetting.</Lore>

c
MotherGothel_003_fMMy, my. I thought you were pretending, but you really don't remember, do you?
