MotherGothel_014_f¨Ah, my favorite little assistant. You're just in time to hear my news about the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem> that you've been "helping" me track for some time now.
.
Player_000_choice_002_fTell me EVERYTHING!
E
Player_000_choice_004_f*Meh... I don't want to deal with this now.
¿
MotherGothel_002_f©After some brilliant deductions on my part, that picture you brought me back from the Mystical Cave showed me what happened to the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>.
Ö
MotherGothel_001_foTo put it simply: It broke. I need you to find the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem> and bring them to me.
ê
MotherGothel_000_fzOnly someone with Dreamlight Magic at their fingertips can gather the pieces of the <ActivityItem>Sunstone</ActivityItem>.
e
MotherGothel_003_fOAnd you're so good at fetching things. It really is your only talent, you know.

MotherGothel_004_fOh, I'm just teasing!

Player_000_choice_008_fI love your jokes!

Player_000_choice_009_fWhy are you so mean?
J
Player_000_choice_010_f/How about an apology or I don't do anything...?
\
MotherGothel_005_fFFinally, someone who appreciates me. My daughter can be so ungrateful.
N
MotherGothel_011_f8Now, about the <ActivityItem>Fragments</ActivityItem>...
§
MotherGothel_012_fçEach of them will appear at a specific time and place. The <ActivityItem>Dawn Fragment</ActivityItem> in the morning on the Sunlit Plateau...
¨
MotherGothel_013_fï... The <ActivityItem>Noon Fragment</ActivityItem> at midday in the Glade, and the <ActivityItem>Dusk Fragment</ActivityItem> at night in the Forest.
í
MotherGothel_015_f|They'll glow like miniature suns on the ground, so you should find them easily. Collect them all, and bring them back to me.
{
MotherGothel_006_feOh, don't be such a baby, {PlayerName}. I'm merely making sure you don't take yourself too seriously.
å
MotherGothel_009_fvYou really should smile more. You don't want to get wrinkles, do you? After all, your face is plain enough as it is...
?
MotherGothel_007_f)Goodness, someone's being petulant today.
-
MotherGothel_010_fFine then. I'm sorry...
Æ
MotherGothel_016_fóYou really should learn to take a joke. Being so serious all the time will give you wrinkles, dear. And trust me, your face is plain enough as it is...
â
MotherGothel_008_fs{PlayerName}... stop with the mumbling. I hate it when you mumble. Come see me as soon as possible. It's important.
