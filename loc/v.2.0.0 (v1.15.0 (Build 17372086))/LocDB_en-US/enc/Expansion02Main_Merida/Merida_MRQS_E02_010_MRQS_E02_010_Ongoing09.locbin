Merida_003_fuWell, first we've got to find that <Lore>potion</Lore> and use it on your Pickaxe. It's in my bag over in the corner.

Merida_004_fxThen I'm sure you can use your Pickaxe to get rid of all those big hunks of <ActivityItem>Petrified Wood</ActivityItem>.

Merida_001_f¡Which should uncover that <Lore>strange disc</Lore> in the middle of the floor. Maybe then we can spin it around to make a picture and it would unlock something.
Q
Merida_002_fALet me know if you need any help. I'll take a look around myself.
