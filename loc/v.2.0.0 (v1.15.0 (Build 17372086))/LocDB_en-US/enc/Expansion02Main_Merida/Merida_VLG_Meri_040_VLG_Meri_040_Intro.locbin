Player_001_choice_001_fWhat did you have in mind?
A
Player_001_choice_002_f&As long as I don't have to eat haggis.

M
Merida_009_f=We can decorate with banners from my family, Clan DunBroch...

Merida_018_fçGood. And while you do that, I'll talk to Tiana. I want Scottish food for the party but honestly... I've never had much skill in the kitchen.
D
Merida_019_f4I've a great lineage of burned bannocks to prove it.

Merida_014_fI think he will too!
E
Merida_015_f5Not at all! I've nothing but respect for Clan McDuck.
