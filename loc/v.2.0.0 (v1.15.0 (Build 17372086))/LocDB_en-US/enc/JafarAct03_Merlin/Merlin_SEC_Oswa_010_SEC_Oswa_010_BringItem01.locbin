Merlin_002_fKHey Merlin, I've got a bit of a quandary for you Ã¢Â€Â” think you can help?

Player_000_choice_000_fWhat kind of information?
#
Player_000_choice_001_fGo on...
6
Player_000_choice_002_fSounds like you're stumped.
¬
Merlin_003_f›Certainly, {PlayerName}. By any chance, does this relate to the Bermuda Triangle and its suitability as a holiday destination? You see, I've recentlyÃ¢Â€Â”

Merlin_004_f#Uhh, not exactly. Check this out...
I
Merlin_005_f9Yes, let's take a closer look Ã¢Â€Â” what have we here...
l
Merlin_006_f\Extraordinary! The Dreamlight Magic in these pieces of the landscape has been tampered with.
2
Merlin_007_f"Yeah, they're also extremely flat.
"
Merlin_008_fHow right you are!
^
Merlin_009_fNOswald messed up, and I'm trying to figure out how to reverse this. Any ideas?

Merlin_010_fqHmm... I've a few ideas we might try. Reverse-hexes, asking them nicely... But we'll need more information first.

Merlin_011_fn{PlayerName}, I'm afraid that the magic governing the shape and dimension of these items has been compromised.

F
Merlin_016_f6As dastardly as he may be, he's extremely intelligent.
¾
Merlin_017_f­And Jafar spent a very long time on Eternity Isle. I'm certain he understands its nature better than anyone. If you could find some of his notes, we may be able to fix this.
a
Merlin_000_fQIn the meantime, I will attempt to wrestle some sense from these strange objects!

Merlin_018_f$I'll go take a look. Thanks, Merlin.
