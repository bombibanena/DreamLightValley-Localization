Merlin_000_f_Oswald, I need your help. There's a Villager who's having trouble tapping into his imagination.

Merlin_003_fpI was talkin' to him just the other day and he started yammerin' on about huntin' me and turnin' me into a stew!

Merlin_005_fXLemme give ya a piece of advice... That Gaston's got an ego even bigger than his biceps!

Merlin_006_f…You wanna inspire him to be creative? Take him some place and show him somethin' to remind him of his own heroism. That oughta do it.

Merlin_007_f’Not a bad idea... thanks Oswald! I'll go back and talk to Gaston. Oh, and don't worry about that hunting thing. I'll make sure that never happens.
