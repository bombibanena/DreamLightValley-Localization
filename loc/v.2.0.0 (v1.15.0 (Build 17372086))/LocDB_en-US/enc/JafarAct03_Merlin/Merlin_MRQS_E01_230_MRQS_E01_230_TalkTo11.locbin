Merlin_000_f*Oswald, I've got a funny question for you.
p
Merlin_001_f`Don't you worry, chum. I'm used to funny business. Spring it on me and I'll tell ya what's what.
]
Merlin_002_fMYou've probably noticed things around the Isle are turning black and white...
.
Merlin_003_f...including my friend Mickey.
[
Merlin_004_fKMerlin told me we need to "use our imaginations" to close the Time Rifts...
>
Merlin_005_f.Oh-hoo-hoo! Have you come to the right rabbit!
•
Merlin_006_f„See, I been doin' some experiments of my own. Ya know, tossin' a few things into those time rift-y thingummys to see what happens...
9
Player_000_choice_000_fOswald, that sounds dangerous!
5
Player_000_choice_001_fDid you discover anything?
-
Merlin_007_fYou bet it was! And fun, too!
J
Merlin_008_f:Mostly nothin' happened when I threw stuff in the rifts...
­
Merlin_009_fœ...but THEN I drew somethin' funny on a napkin and tossed that in. After that, all I had to do was think about the rift closin' and BAM! It zipped right up!
t
Merlin_010_fdThat's it! So all we have to do is make something using our imaginations and toss it into the rifts?
R
Merlin_011_fBSure seems like it. Except... When I tried it again, I got bupkus!
b
Merlin_012_fRI think each rift's gotta be closed by <Lore>a different joe's imagination</Lore>.
A
Player_001_choice_000_f&Got any tips for using my imagination?
;
Player_001_choice_001_f Got it. I'll go ask some people.

Merlin_013_fAbsopositively!
e
Merlin_014_fUMaximizin' your imagination is all about usin' what you got but in funny kindsa ways!
«
Merlin_015_fšYa know, like lookin' at stuff and askin' what else it could be instead. Is a hat only a hat? OR is it also a giant soup bowl that leaks real slooooowly?!
x
Merlin_016_fhSay, maybe you could try <Lore>askin' Rapunzel, Gaston, EVE, and that Mickey fella you mentioned</Lore>?
U
Merlin_017_fESounds like Mickey's in heaps of trouble, so I bet he'd love to help.
;
Merlin_018_f+That Rapunzel sure has a great imagination.
v
Merlin_019_ffGaston... well, since he imagines he's such a swell guy, he could prob'ly imagine just about anything.
Œ
Merlin_020_f|And as for that clankin' contraption, EVE? Gee, I'd sure like to find out what she could imagine if she put her gears to it!
