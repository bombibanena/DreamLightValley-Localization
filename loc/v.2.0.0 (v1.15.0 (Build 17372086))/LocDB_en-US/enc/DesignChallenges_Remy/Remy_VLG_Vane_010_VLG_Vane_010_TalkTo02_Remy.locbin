Remy_000_fTRemy, I'm helping Vanellope bake a replica of her racing kart, and I need your help.

Remy_001_flFor Vanellope? You got it! That kid has the sweetest sweet tooth I've ever seen! Seriously, it's impressive.
.
Player_000_choice_000_fAND she's adorable!
.
Player_000_choice_001_fWhat does she like?

Player_000_choice_002_fShe's never seen a vegetable.
j

Remy_002_f\She sure is! And enthusiastic! My friend Colette would say she's got a real "joie de vivre."
O

Remy_003_fAYou said you were helping her BAKE a kart? You mean out of dough?
R

Remy_004_fDYes! I need something we can use to stick the pastry parts together.

Remy_005_f'Ha-ha. Actually, I have just the thing.

Remy_006_fEI was constructing a croquembouche and tried a new frosting recipe...
H

Remy_007_f:But my brother Emile ate some and it glued his mouth shut.

Player_001_choice_000_fDid you invent Sugar Superglue?
D
Player_001_choice_001_f)Sounds perfect for making a pastry tower!
,
Player_001_choice_002_fWow, pastry fail.

Remy_008_fJNo, no, it's not glue. It's definitely frosting. Just not the edible kind.
w

Remy_009_fiWe had to pry open Emile's jaw with a stale breadstick. Don't worry; it's not poisonous, just... intense.
\

Remy_010_fNHere. This should work for Vanellope's kart. Remember... don't let her eat it.
™

Remy_011_fõYeah. I bet that croquembouche is still standing. We had to pry Emile's jaw open with a stale breadstick. Don't worry; it's not poisonous, just... intense.
≤

Remy_012_f£Epic pastry fail. The choux puffs were inedible, and we had to pry open poor Emile's jaw with a stale breadstick! Don't worry; it's not poisonous, just... intense.

Remy_013_fOIf it's got sugar, she loves it. √É¬âclairs, cr√É¬™pes, madeleines, macarons...

Remy_014_fçTrust me; I know. I tried to serve her a sweet potato once. She told me, and I quote... "Call me when it's sweet potato pie, and we'll talk."
