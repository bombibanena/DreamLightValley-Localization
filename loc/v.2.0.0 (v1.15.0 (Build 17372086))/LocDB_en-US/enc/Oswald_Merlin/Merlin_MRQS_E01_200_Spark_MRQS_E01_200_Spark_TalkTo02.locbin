Oswald_000_fWhy, hello!
K
Merlin_000_f;It, er... it seems you have found the Spark of Imagination.
@
Player_001_choice_000_f%Merlin! I was just gonna go find you!
H
Player_001_choice_001_f-Phewf! It's just you. Scared me for a second.
A
Player_001_choice_002_f&How'd you get down here so quickly...?
p
Merlin_005_f`No need. No need. For I, Merlin, have used one of my pedestrian parlor tricks to find you first.
r
Merlin_001_fbNow then, hand the Spark of Imagination over to me. I must do some of my endless research upon it.
v
Merlin_002_ffAnd I solemnly swear, I will keep it safe from that nefarious, cunning, and devilishly handsome Jafar.
'
Player_000_choice_000_fHere you go!
E
Player_000_choice_001_f*Something about this doesn't seem right...
N
Player_000_choice_002_f3If you're really Merlin, what are your magic words?
M
Merlin_003_f=Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Once again, you prove to be an utter fool!
a
Merlin_009_fQOh, come now. It is I, your magical mentor. Have I ever steered you wrong before?

Merlin_010_fI don't know...
K
Merlin_011_f;Stop being foolish. If you will not give the Spark to me...
/
Merlin_012_f...then I shall simply take it!
%
Merlin_014_fMy... my magic words?
R
Merlin_015_fBDo not be foolish. We both know precisely what my magic words are.
+
Merlin_016_fOkay then. Let's hear them.

Merlin_017_f...

Merlin_013_f	Higity...

Merlin_018_f
...figity?
?
Player_002_choice_000_f$Huh. That SOUNDS right. Here you go!
E
Player_002_choice_001_f*That didn't sound right at all. Try again.
D
Player_002_choice_002_f)So you're totally Jafar in disguise, huh?
+
Merlin_021_fEr, uh... wait. I misspoke.
$
Merlin_022_fI of course meant...
'
Merlin_023_fFlippitus... floppitus?
9
Player_003_choice_000_fThat seems right. Here you go!
A
Player_003_choice_001_f&That seems even more wrong. Try again.
F
Player_003_choice_002_f+Okay, you are DEFINITELY Jafar in disguise.

Merlin_024_fEr... uh...
!
Merlin_025_fZim zaba rim bim!
9
Player_004_choice_000_fThat seems right. Here you go!
@
Player_004_choice_001_f%That's enough of this charade, Jafar.
?
Player_004_choice_002_f$That is DEFINITELY wrong. Try again.
<
Merlin_020_f,Jafar?! Bah! What a PREPOSTEROUS accusation.
<
Merlin_027_f,I am afraid I must come to a sad conclusion.
A
Merlin_028_f1The Forgetting has made me forget my magic words.
9
Player_005_choice_000_fThat makes sense. Here you go.
:
Player_005_choice_001_fOh, come on, Jafar. Give it up!
 
Merlin_006_fThere is no need to fear. It is merely I, Merlin, as I am sure you can tell from this unnecessarily voluminous white beard and impractical hat.
„
Merlin_007_ftHow did I get down here...? Why, I am Merlin. I simply used one of my pedestrian parlor tricks to appear before you.
