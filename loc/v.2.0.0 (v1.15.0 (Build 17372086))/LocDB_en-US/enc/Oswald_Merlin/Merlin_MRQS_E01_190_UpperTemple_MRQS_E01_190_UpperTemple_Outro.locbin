Merlin_020_fOI've done some investigation, {PlayerName}, and I can confirm what I suspected.
†
Merlin_021_fvJafar's experiments have begun to <Lore>cause parts of Dreamlight Valley's past to leak through to the present</Lore>.

Merlin_022_fHow do we stop him?

Merlin_023_foFor now, at least, it appears he hasn't a clue how to work the Spark's magic. There must be some trick to it...
@
Player_000_choice_000_f%Maybe he doesn't know the magic word?

Player_000_choice_001_fMaybe the Spark is busted?

Player_000_choice_003_f#Maybe you need to be pure of heart?

Merlin_000_fmI suppose it's possible that a magic word is required, but I haven't found anything like that in my research.

Merlin_013_flHey, speaking of the Spark and things from the past... do you happen to know a rabbit by the name of Oswald?
:
Merlin_014_f*Hmm? Why, er... no, I can't say that I do.
l
Merlin_015_f\I discovered him in the Ancient Ruins. But he seems to be having some trouble communicating.
V
Merlin_016_fFI think he might have been here in Dreamlight Valley before any of us.

Merlin_017_fHow peculiar.
n
Merlin_018_f^Well, perhaps if you befriend this rabbit, you'll uncover more about Dreamlight Valley's past.
D
Merlin_019_f4That might be just the key to preserving its future!
€
Merlin_001_fpOh dear, I... I hope not. I fear that would mean Dreamlight Valley itself could start coming apart at the seams.

Merlin_002_f…Yes, perhaps one must have a certain quality within to wield the Spark. Though I'm not sure purity of heart is quite the right one...
