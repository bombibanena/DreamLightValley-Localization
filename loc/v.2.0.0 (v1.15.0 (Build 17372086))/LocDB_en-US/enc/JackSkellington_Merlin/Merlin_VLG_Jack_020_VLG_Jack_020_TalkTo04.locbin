Merlin_000_f@Merlin, I could use some help Ã¢Â€Â” it's a bit of an emergency.
?
Merlin_001_f/An emergency? Goodness, what's the trouble now?
_
Merlin_002_fOWell, I was helping Jack Skellington with his dreams of scientific discovery...
_
Merlin_003_fOAnd something went dreadfully wrong? Ahh, I've certainly been in that position.
3
Player_000_choice_000_fI knew you'd understand.
7
Player_000_choice_001_fAmazing. You're a lifesaver.
@
Player_000_choice_002_f%Aren't you a wizard, not a scientist?

Merlin_004_fFar too well.
\
Merlin_013_fLNow which one was it...? Was it green? No... no... it must have been purple.
,
Merlin_014_fOkay, purple potion. Got it.
h
Merlin_015_fXOr was the purple the exact one to avoid in this situation? I'm sure it's in my notes...
b
Merlin_016_fRI do know that you're looking for the <Lore>Night Thorn's perfect opposite</Lore>.
±
Merlin_017_f I've a <Lore>Green Formula</Lore>, a <Lore>Blue Formula</Lore>, a <Lore>Yellow Formula</Lore>, and a <Lore>Purple Formula</Lore>. But which is the right one...?
-
Merlin_005_fNow, tell me what went wrong.
O
Merlin_006_f?So Jack Skellington was curious about Night Shards, and well...
=
Merlin_007_f-...somehow he made a Giant Night Thorn plant.
u
Merlin_008_feHmm... I suppose I should be disapproving, but... I can't say that I haven't been in the same pickle.

Merlin_009_f... Really?
…
Merlin_010_fuOh yes! I did my share of experiments before you returned to the Valley and... well, not all of them were successful.
’
Merlin_011_fLuckily, I have just the formula for this. A sort of potion, as it were. It turns out that complementary metaphysics are the key!
(
Merlin_012_fYou're the best, Merlin.
P
Merlin_018_f@Just look around my library Ã¢Â€Â” you'll find it easily enough.
>
Merlin_019_f.Merlin, look at this place Ã¢Â€Â” it's a mess!
u
Merlin_020_feNonsense! Everything is exactly where it's meant to be! You simply don't understand my filing system.
2
Player_001_choice_000_fMust be a wizard thing.
'
Player_001_choice_001_fClearly not.
U
Player_001_choice_002_f:I have my doubts about there being a filing system at all.

Merlin_021_f
Precisely!
O
Merlin_022_f?Now, I've other business to attend to. Good luck, {PlayerName}!
z
Merlin_023_fjWell, I'll leave the administration of the Valley to you, and you leave the organization of my home to me.
w
Merlin_024_fgHappens to all wizards Ã¢Â€Â” people attribute to you what you haven't done, and dismiss what you have!
P
Merlin_025_f@Oh well, it'll be easy enough to find once you enter my library.
Z
Merlin_026_fJMerlin, I've seen what it's like in your House Ã¢Â€Â” the place is a mess!
T
Merlin_027_fDOh, hem, well, let's see what I can do before you go on thanking me.
c
Merlin_028_fSYes, yes. But a thoughtful wizard is a scientist who uses magic for their research!
