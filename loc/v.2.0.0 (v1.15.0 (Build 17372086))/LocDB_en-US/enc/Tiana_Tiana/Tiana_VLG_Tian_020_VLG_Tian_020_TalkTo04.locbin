Tiana_001_f(There we go Ã¢Â€Â” Little Louis is free!

Tiana_002_fOh, I'm so glad!
J
Tiana_003_f;But... what if he gets hungry and I'm not here to feed him?
M
Tiana_004_f>Well, he'd probably eat what all the other crocs here eat, no?
\
Tiana_005_fMThe waters in the Glade of Trust are full of tasty lobsters for him to catch!
T
Tiana_006_fEThat's true. And I'll be sure to bring him gumbo as often as I can...
†
Tiana_007_fwBut I do worry about him out here. What if after being in that human cage, the other crocodiles don't welcome him back?
u
Tiana_008_ffI suppose what I'm saying is... what if being just a regular crocodile doesn't make him happy anymore?

Tiana_014_fdIf you want to do something for Little Louis, especially after he was confined... I'm happy to help.

Tiana_015_fOh, thank you, {PlayerName}!
a
Tiana_018_fRI was thinking we could <Lore>make him a little shelter</Lore>. Would you help me?
=
Tiana_009_f.I have this... It should help you get started.

Tiana_020_fThat sounds so cute! On it!
(
Tiana_012_f*laugh* I don't think so.
G
Tiana_013_f8But he's definitely different from the other crocodiles.

Tiana_017_fThat's my fear.
