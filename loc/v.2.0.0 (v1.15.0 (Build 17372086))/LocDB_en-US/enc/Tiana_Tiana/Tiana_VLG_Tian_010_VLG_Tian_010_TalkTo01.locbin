o
Tiana_005_f`I'm glad you like it! I was thinking we might sell an accompaniment that'll spice up any dish...

Tiana_006_f.What do you think of selling hot pepper sauce?
U
Tiana_007_fFI think that's a great idea! Do you need a hand with the pepper sauce?

Tiana_008_fmI think I should be good for now. I just need to start recipe testing and get the first batch of sauce going.

Tiana_009_f«But... it would be nice to invite some of the Villagers to taste the food when it's ready. After all, when you have a new venue, you've got to have a grand opening, right?
?
Tiana_010_f0Sure! Anyone in particular that I should invite?
¥
Tiana_011_f•Oh... Well, <Lore>Moana</Lore> mentioned that she really liked the Enchanted Shrimp ÃƒÂ‰touffÃƒÂ©e when I spoke to her earlier. Would you invite her?
