MotherGothel_000_f4Mother Gothel? I need to talk to you about Rapunzel.
n
MotherGothel_001_fXOh? What is my precious flower up to today? Breaking more rules and shattering my heart?
;
Player_000_choice_000_f Why do you call her your flower?
5
Player_000_choice_001_fI heard you made her sing.
B
Player_000_choice_002_f'Escaping your control once and for all!
D
MotherGothel_004_f.Hmm? Oh, it's just my little pet name for her.
G
MotherGothel_005_f1My fragile, delicate, rebellious little flower...
x
MotherGothel_006_fbUh-huh... And calling her "flower" has nothing to do with her magic √¢¬Ä¬î when she sings for you?
K
MotherGothel_007_f5I've no idea what you're talking about, {PlayerName}.
é
MotherGothel_017_fxListen. I'm trying to find a way to harness Rapunzel's magic so she doesn't have to sing for you if she doesn't want to.
l
MotherGothel_018_fVWhat a brilliant idea. I can't believe I never thought of it. Oh, that's right. I did.
i
MotherGothel_019_fSI've searched for answers for years! You know how much I would love independence...
#
MotherGothel_020_fFor Rapunzel.
/
Player_001_choice_000_fHelp me to help you.
/
Player_001_choice_001_fLet's work together!
9
Player_001_choice_002_fI'll succeed where you failed.
J
MotherGothel_022_f4I know you're SO busy with... uh... being glamorous.
i
MotherGothel_026_fSSo very true. It's exhausting being in such high demand. I suppose you could try...
m
MotherGothel_028_fW*sigh* Very well... Rapunzel's magic comes from a rare bloom called the Sundrop Flower.
l
MotherGothel_029_fVHmmm... I might be able to find some petals if I use my Hourglass. Where would I look?
Ω
MotherGothel_030_f¶Well, since you're feeling so ambitious, take this. It's a <Lore>map</Lore> I made of places the Sundrops grew before they all dried up, petals scattered to the wind.
ì
MotherGothel_031_f}If you find any √¢¬Ä¬î which you won't √¢¬Ä¬î take the petals to someone skilled with magic. Perhaps they'll know what to do.
|
MotherGothel_032_ff<Lore>Find the Sundrop Petals with the map and Hourglass. Take them to someone magical</Lore>. Got it.
Y
MotherGothel_021_fCWhy would I waste my precious energy on a task I know is fruitless?
1
MotherGothel_025_fSo... let me do it for you?
Å
MotherGothel_023_fkFail? Don't be ridiculous. And now that I have Rapunzel back, I've no reason to embark on fruitless quests.
t
MotherGothel_024_f^I think you're afraid that I'll beat you at your own game. You don't want me to figure it out.
I
MotherGothel_027_f3Ha! Please. But since it seems you won't go away...
s
MotherGothel_008_f]"Made"? Please! You've seen her running around the Isle! I can't make her do a thing anymore.
B
MotherGothel_009_f,She was happy to volunteer her voice for me.
5
MotherGothel_010_fShe didn't seem happy about it.
f
MotherGothel_011_fPOh, was she a little pouty? Ignore that. You just don't know Rapunzel like I do.
\
MotherGothel_012_fFYou're right. You know her best, so... Where does her magic come from?
7
MotherGothel_016_f!Who knows? It IS magic after all.
y
MotherGothel_003_fcMy control? Ha! Oh {PlayerName}, you shouldn't try to make jokes with such a faulty sense of humor.
h
MotherGothel_013_fRI'm her MOTHER. Is it any wonder my daughter loves me after all I've done for her?

MotherGothel_014_fKind of.
 
MotherGothel_015_f
Excuse me?
