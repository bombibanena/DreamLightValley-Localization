FairyGodMother_001_f>Well, {PlayerName}? What did you discover in the final Memory?
u
FairyGodMother_002_f]Scar tricked the Forgotten into helping the Night Thorns spread. And then Merlin showed up...

Player_000_fiMerlin warned the Forgotten not to lose faith in love, friendship, and the power of small acts of care...

Player_000_choice_000_fBut it was too late.
L
Player_000_choice_001_f1I think he almost got through to the Forgotten...
H
Player_000_choice_002_f-The Forgotten was tired of being lectured to.

FairyGodMother_003_fThe Forgotten was too far gone.
Ž
FairyGodMother_005_fvWe mustn't give up. Merlin may have planted a seed in the Forgotten's mind. Perhaps it just needs a little watering...

FairyGodMother_009_fgIn the final Memory... it looked like the Forgotten ran away to a castle. I've seen that castle before.

FairyGodMother_010_f_There's another side of Dreamlight Valley. A shadowy side. You can get there through portals...

FairyGodMother_011_fnOf course! If you're ever to save the Forgotten, you must venture to the Forgotten's home and face them there.

FairyGodMother_012_f>But how to get there? Perhaps it's time I consult with Merlin.

FairyGodMother_013_fkOh! Before I depart... now that the Forgotten's Memories are recovered, the Orb of Remembrance is repaired!

FairyGodMother_014_fˆBe a dear and <Lore>return it to the Pillar in the Forgotten Lands</Lore> while I seek out Merlin. Goodbye for now. I will see you soon!

FairyGodMother_004_fhMerlin planted a seed in the Forgotten's mind. If we could just water it... give it a little sunlight...
S
FairyGodMother_006_f;I agree. The Forgotten is not lost to us for good. Not yet.
_
FairyGodMother_007_fGThe Forgotten needed someone to understand. Not someone to give advice.
^
FairyGodMother_008_fFAnd no one could ever understand the Forgotten better than you, child.
