Mirabel_003_füAnd since you've told me there are so many great couples in the family Madrigal, I thought we could ask your opinion on what goes into keeping a romance alive!

Mirabel_007_f9So what's something that helps them keep the spark going?

Mirabel_008_fWell, definitely food.

Mirabel_011_f6But even when people aren't hurt, her food is amazing!

Mirabel_012_f~Sometimes Papi will take a bite of an arepa and just melt! I think their love for each other makes the food taste even better.
