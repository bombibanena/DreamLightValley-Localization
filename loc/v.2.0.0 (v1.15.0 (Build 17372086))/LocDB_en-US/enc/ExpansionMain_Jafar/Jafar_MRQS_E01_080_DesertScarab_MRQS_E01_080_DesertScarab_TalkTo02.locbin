Jafar_003_f3I see that you have acquired one half of my Scarab.
'
Player_000_choice_000_fYOUR Scarab?
3
Player_000_choice_001_fWere you... watching me?
\
Player_000_choice_002_fAYup! Only had to deal with a socially starved Gaston for a while.
5
Jafar_004_f&Yes Ã¢Â€Â” I did create it, after all.
v
Jafar_013_fgYeah... We found it while we were searching for the Scarab piece. I think it's kind of sweet, actually.
T
Jafar_019_fEIt is possible that now, with company, he will be of greater service.
g
Jafar_002_fXThe second half of the Scarab remains to be found, and Gaston may be of help to you yet.
|
Jafar_018_fmDo not limit your search to the Glittering Dunes. After all, the lush jungle to the east used to be a desert.
`
Jafar_020_fQAll right, I'll <Lore>check back in with Gaston</Lore> and get back to my search.
<
Jafar_009_f-I commend you on your progress, {PlayerName}.
O
Jafar_000_f@There may be reason to hope we will avert catastrophe after all.
h
Jafar_022_fYWhy didn't you tell me that the Jewel of Time was in some secret vault full of treasures?
4
Jafar_023_f%Perhaps I wanted to test your mettle.

Jafar_024_f€Though I had hoped Gaston would have done most of the work for you, and it would be as simple as taking the Scarab Key from him.
e
Jafar_010_fVI charged Gaston with this task some time ago, and clearly, the fool made no progress.
m
Jafar_011_f^Honestly, I think he was too lonely to be productive. He recreated his friend out of coconuts.

Jafar_012_f... Coconuts?

Jafar_005_fPerhaps.
˜
Jafar_006_fˆPerhaps I have certain devices keyed into the magical aura of the Scarab that alert me when it comes into contact with Dreamlight Magic.
6
Jafar_021_f'I think I will let you wonder... Now...
-
Jafar_007_fYes... You have my sympathies.
K
Jafar_008_f<That being said, he's gotten really good at arts and crafts.
