Jafar_002_f&Ah, {PlayerName}, there you are. Good.
G
Jafar_003_f8As you can see, the <Lore>Ancient Gate is closed</Lore>.
v
Jafar_004_fgThere used to be a <ActivityItem>Sphere</ActivityItem> here that powered the gate, allowing it to open.
W
Jafar_000_fHIt looked <Lore>just like the other blue spheres around the gate</Lore>.
Q
Jafar_011_fBBut alas, it has been broken and the pieces scattered to the wind.
O
Jafar_005_f@All thanks to that <Lore>flying, chirping metal nuisance</Lore>!
