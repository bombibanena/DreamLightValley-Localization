Sully_000_f9Hey there! You must be the intern we've been waiting for!
…
Sully_015_fvYou picked a strange day to show up, though, because... uh Ã¢Â€Â” nobody else did. We have no idea where everybody is!
p
Sully_016_faAnd we're in a real tight jam. Monstropolis needs power, but this is not a two-monster operation.
?
Player_002_choice_000_f$How about a THREE-monster operation?
@
Player_002_choice_001_f%Seems like you need some extra hands.
K
Player_002_choice_002_f0So unprofessional. What kind of company is this?

Sully_019_fpWell, usually it takes dozens of monsters to keep this place running... Did I mention that I'm glad you're here?
s
Sully_021_fdLook at it this way: You're gonna get some hands-on experience on a Laugh Floor your very first day.
ƒ
Sully_023_ftYa know... I don't mean to be rude but, uh, you're a little human-shaped. I've never seen a monster like you before.
A
Player_004_choice_000_f&I retracted my extra arms before work.
E
Player_004_choice_001_f*Human-shaped? Ha! I get that all the time!
H
Player_004_choice_002_f-Inappropriate! I'm calling Monster Resources!
,
Sully_025_fOh, okay. No need to explain.
P
Sully_028_fAIt's just that it's company policy. No humans on the Laugh Floor.
c
Sully_027_fTIf human adults knew about us, it'd be... Sheesh, I don't even wanna think about it.
,
Sully_007_fWell, welcome to the company!
n
Sully_001_f_I'm James P. Sullivan, CEO... But please, call me Sulley. And over there? That's Mike Wazowski.
!
Player_000_fI'm {PlayerName}!
?
Player_000_choice_000_f$I can't wait to start my internship!
0
Player_000_choice_001_fCan I call him Mikey?
A
Player_000_choice_002_f&I'm DEFINITELY a monster, not a human.
2
Sully_003_f#Gotta love that go-getter attitude!
w
Sully_005_fhWhy don't we get you started while Mike and I figure out how to run this place with just three monsters.
n
Sully_029_f_We had our Laugh Power launch party a couple days ago and this Laugh Floor needs a little work.
È
Sully_006_f¸We already swept up all the confetti and took down the decorations. Could you <Lore>clean up the rest of the party trash</Lore> and <Lore>rinse away the slug slime on the floor</Lore>?
7
Player_001_choice_000_fI'll get started right away!
*
Player_001_choice_001_f... Slug slime?
8
Player_001_choice_002_fYou want me to pick up trash?
H
Sully_009_f9Great! I appreciate that positive attitude, {PlayerName}.
i
Sully_011_fZI'm sure there's something around here that can help ya <Lore>rinse the slime away</Lore>.
2
Sully_014_f#Don't worry! I've got my own tools.
E
Sully_013_f6Nice! Well, come back and see me when you're finished.
\
Sully_008_fMYou bet. Those slugs know how to dance but... Phew, it really leaves a trail.
`
Sully_010_fQHey, everybody starts somewhere. Mike and I worked our way up from the mail room.
˜
Sully_002_fˆUh... If you want my advice, call him "Mr. Wazowski" until he tells you otherwise. Mike'll like it if you make him feel like a big deal.
c
Sully_004_fTRight! Okay. Great. Although it's kind of weird you felt the need to reiterate that.
4
Sully_024_f%Do you? That's uh... that's a relief.
'
Sully_026_fWait! No! I can explain.
D
Sully_018_f5No kidding. I was kinda hoping you'd have eight arms.
U
Sully_020_fFTrust me: This has never happened before. We are the best of the best.
