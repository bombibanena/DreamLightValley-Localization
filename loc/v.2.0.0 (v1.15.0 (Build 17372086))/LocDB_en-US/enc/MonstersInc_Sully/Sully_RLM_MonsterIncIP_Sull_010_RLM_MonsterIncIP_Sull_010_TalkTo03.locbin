Sully_000_f3Okay, stay calm! It's only a... small... emergency!
J
Sully_003_f;The door powered down, and Mike's stuck in the human world!
6
Player_000_choice_000_fDon't panic. What do we do?
8
Player_000_choice_001_fIs it time to freak out now?!
R
Player_000_choice_002_f7The way he was talking, it seems like he can handle it.
3
Sully_005_f$You're right. Mike's countin' on us.
g
Sully_007_fXSince this is an emergency... we need the <ActivityItem>Emergency Manual</ActivityItem>.
”
Sully_010_f„MIFT usually keeps a copy of the <ActivityItem>Emergency Manual</ActivityItem> somewhere on each Laugh Floor. I need you to find it.

Player_001_choice_001_f"Why do you think Mike's in danger?

Player_001_choice_002_f!I'll find that manual right away!
F
Sully_013_f7Oh, MIFT is the Monsters, Incorporated Facilities Team.
A
Sully_001_f2They make sure everything here's in top condition.

L
Sully_004_f=Yes! I mean Ã¢Â€Â” no! No... We just have to figure this out.

Sully_006_fwWhat can I say? Mike's a genius Jokester, and he's not shy about it. But this has nothin' to do with collecting laughs.
