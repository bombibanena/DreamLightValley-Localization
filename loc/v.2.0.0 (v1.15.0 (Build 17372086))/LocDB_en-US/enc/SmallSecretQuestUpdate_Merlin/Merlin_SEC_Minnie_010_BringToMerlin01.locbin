Merlin_001_fSpell? What spellÃ¢Â€Â”
d
Merlin_002_fTOh. Oh dear... I'm... heh... well, I'm afraid we've had a bit of a misunderstanding.
p
Merlin_003_f`I merely needed these <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> for my research. Terribly sorry.

Merlin_004_f}I thought you understood. No, no... I'm afraid there isn't any sort of spell or enchantment that will solve Minnie's problem.
B
Player_001_choice_000_f'But there must be some way to help her?
D
Player_001_choice_001_f)Then why'd you make me do all that work?!
:
Merlin_005_f*Oh, yes. Not to worry. There certainly is.

Merlin_006_fhYou see, what protects Minnie, what protects all of us here... is an altogether different sort of magic.
˜
Merlin_007_f‡Friendship, love, care Ã¢Â€Â” that's what binds this Valley together. And kind words and small favors are the source of all this magic.
X
Merlin_008_fHMinnie simply needs to be shown that spirit will never leave this place.
v
Merlin_009_ffSo that's why you wanted me to talk to some of the other Villagers. If I tell Minnie what they said...
”
Merlin_010_fƒ...it will remind her of the love that binds us all together... and that everyone is safe here so long as we never forget it again.

Merlin_012_f#Enchantment? What enchantmentÃ¢Â€Â”
†
Merlin_013_fvNow see here! I'm not some sort of machine you put <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem> into and magic comes out!
e
Merlin_014_fUEr, right. Sorry. I just meant... now you have everything for the enchantment, right?
