Merlin_000_f*Hm? What have you got there, {PlayerName}?
M
Merlin_001_f=Ah-ha! My notes! Why, I've been looking everywhere for those.
t
Merlin_002_fdAnd it's a good thing you found them, too. I wouldn't have wanted them to fall into the wrong hands.

Player_000_f%I couldn't understand what they said.

Player_000_choice_000_f"Must be important wizard business.

Player_000_choice_001_fWhat are these all about?
2
Player_000_choice_002_fThey're just gibberish!
2
Merlin_003_f"I suppose that's true, in a sense.
i
Merlin_004_fYYou see, I fear there's nefarious business afoot. So I began noting down my observations.
 
Merlin_005_fMother Gothel and Ursula have been meeting all around the Village. Those two are up to no good, I just know it! You can't trust either of them!
€
Merlin_006_fpThat's why I've been keeping track of their little meetings. Four times now, I've caught them scheming together.
˜
Merlin_007_f‡They've been exchanging all manner of, well, of mysterious ingredients and vials. And the moment I draw near, they clam up and run off!
Q
Merlin_008_fAEr, though, I suppose in Ursula's case, I mean to say "swim off."

Player_001_choice_000_fThey must be up to no good.
@
Player_001_choice_001_f%Sounds suspicious. But we need proof.
>
Player_001_choice_002_f#Probably nothing. Leave them alone.
•
Merlin_009_f„Of course they are! But I suppose we should get some proof of exactly what they're up to. I'm afraid my magic only shows me so much.
{
Merlin_010_fkUrsula and Mother Gothel both trust you far more than they do me. Perhaps we can use that to our advantage.
^
Merlin_011_fNI suspect that you could get close enough to hear what they're scheming about.
G
Player_002_choice_000_f,The fate of Dreamlight Valley depends on it!
F
Player_002_choice_001_f+I'll only do it so you'll leave them alone.
7
Player_002_choice_002_fI'm kind of curious now too!
¸
Merlin_012_f§Oh dear. Well, I... uh... I certainly hope that's not the case. More likely, it's just some petty scheme they've concocted. But we can't be too careful with those two.
k
Merlin_013_f[Now, I may not be able to prognosticate what Mother Gothel and Ursula are scheming about...
I
Merlin_014_f9...but I do know precisely where they'll be meeting next.
;
Merlin_015_f+They gather each day in the Glade of Trust.
–
Merlin_023_f…They already met there earlier today, so you'll have to <Lore>wait until tomorrow to catch them.</Lore> Remember: the Glade of Trust!
“
Merlin_016_f‚Oh, balderdash! Go investigate and you'll see. Ursula and Mother Gothel could prove quite a thorn in our side if they join forces.
Ç
Merlin_017_f¶Well now, curiosity is a fine reason to act! There is that old adage about it being rather unkind to cats... But every great discovery springs forth from at least a bit of curiosity.
œ
Merlin_018_f‹Well, yes... uh... you're quite right. And my soothsaying abilities can only tell us so much. We've got to know exactly what they're up to.
_
Merlin_019_fOYou're far too trusting, {PlayerName}. Trouble follows those two like a shadow.
‡
Merlin_020_fwBut I suppose if you could prove that they AREN'T up to any villainous business, well... then my worries will be eased.
u
Merlin_021_feBut you'll have to bring me that proof! I'm afraid my soothsaying abilities can only tell us so much.
?
Merlin_022_f/Hardly! You just have to know how to read them.
