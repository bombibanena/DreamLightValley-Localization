Merlin_000_fWell then, what's all this?
i
Merlin_001_fYHeh-heh, I don't recall requesting such an extravagant meal. Though I am a bit peckish...
A
Merlin_002_f1It's a "thank you" meal, courtesy of me and Remy.
~
Player_000_fnWe wanted to show our gratitude to you for taking care of this Village during the Forgetting. And for being...
A
Player_000_choice_000_f&...the greatest wizard in any century.
G
Player_000_choice_001_f,...even more marvelous than indoor plumbing.
S
Player_000_choice_002_f8...the only one who knows what's going on half the time.
Ž
Merlin_003_f~Oh, goodness... Why, that's quite kind of you both. Though I hope you don't think I stayed behind in the Valley for accolades.
Z
Merlin_004_fJActually, I'm... well, I'm afraid I haven't the faintest idea what to say.

Merlin_005_f\I suppose, hmm... I suppose I never expected a thank-you. I was simply doing what was right.

D

a
Merlin_007_fQActs of kindness like this meal are what hold this Valley together, {PlayerName}.

Merlin_008_fI shall!
u
Merlin_009_feHuh? Why, uh, uh, no. Of course not. It's just some... some blasted Dreamlight in my eye, that's all!
N
Merlin_010_f>... Oh, all right. I admit your gesture has me a little teary.
N
Merlin_011_f>Oh. Well, then I must be marvelous indeed, mustn't I? Heh-heh.
t
Merlin_012_fdHeh-heh, well, it helps to have glimpsed the future... and to have a great deal of books to consult.
