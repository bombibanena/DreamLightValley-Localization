Daisy_001_fm{PlayerName}, this lookbook will absolutely convince Uncle Scrooge to add our clothes to his shop. It HAS to!

Daisy_002_fwLet's REALLY seal the deal by creating some demand in the Valley. It's time for you to sashay from model to influencer!

Daisy_003_f˜Minnie and I are going to finish up the lookbook. Can you take these <ActivityItem>Business Cards</ActivityItem> and give them to a couple of Villagers?

Daisy_007_f|If they start to ask about Dots & Daisies, Uncle Scrooge will know that he HAS to add us to his shop. Villagers will notice.
