Daisy_001_f)This definitely narrows our suspect list!

Player_001_choice_000_fIt HAS to be Stitch.
:
Player_001_choice_001_fI'm sure Vanellope is involved.
>
Player_001_choice_002_f#I'm totally lost. Help me out here.
M
Daisy_002_f>I think you're right! But I'm certain he wasn't working alone.
r
Daisy_017_fcAccording to Donald, Stitch is a master prankster. I think he's recruited Vanellope as his partner.
a
Daisy_006_fRJust recently someone switched every one of Goofy's fishing lures for gummy worms.
B
Daisy_007_f3Someone ALSO filled Remy's salt shakers with sugar.
s
Daisy_018_fdAnd I found blue fiber at every scene. I didn't realize it was fur. I was thinking "fluffy sweater."

Player_002_choice_000_fSugar and blue fur! It's them.

Player_002_choice_001_fSo Scrooge was innocent?
-
Player_002_choice_002_fWhat's the motive?
G
Daisy_000_f8I guess I'm just the latest victim in their prank spree.

Player_003_choice_000_fWhat do we do now?

Player_003_choice_001_fYou must be furious.
.
Player_003_choice_002_fI say we retaliate!
n
Daisy_009_f_They need to be stopped before they anger someone who would, let's say... turn them into algae.
}
Daisy_010_fn{PlayerName}, this calls for a sting! YOU convince them you want in on their next prank and arrange a meeting.
C
Daisy_023_f4I'll surprise them and give them a piece of my mind!

Player_000_fDevious plan...

Player_000_choice_000_f#Don't you think it's a little mean?
D
Player_000_choice_001_f)I'm not a good enough actor to do this...
/
Player_000_choice_002_fI love it. Muwahaha!
R
Daisy_013_fCBelieve me, it'd be meaner to wait for them to get in REAL trouble.
k
Daisy_016_f\I'll <Lore>talk to Stitch</Lore>. Convince him to meet me in the Cursed Cave with Vanellope.

Daisy_024_fPerfect!
i
Daisy_014_fZOf course you are! Besides, it can't come from me Ã¢Â€Â” that would be WAY too suspicious.

Daisy_015_fHooray!
z
Daisy_021_fkAnnoyed yes, but not furious. We solved a mystery Ã¢Â€Â” that's one of my favorite things to do! However...
<
Daisy_022_f-I think a lesson should certainly be learned.
S
Daisy_020_fDYou're right. With your evidence, it's clearly Stitch and Vanellope.

Daisy_005_f"What if it's Vanellope AND Stitch?
ž
Daisy_003_fŽBlue fur is definitely a certain fluffy blue alien. But I didn't see Stitch at the gala, so I think he had help from a guest Ã¢Â€Â” Vanellope!
