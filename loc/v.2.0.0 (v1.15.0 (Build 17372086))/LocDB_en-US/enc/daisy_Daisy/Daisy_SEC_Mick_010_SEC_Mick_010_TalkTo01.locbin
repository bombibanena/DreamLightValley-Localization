Daisy_003_fFabulous! You're here!
M
Daisy_004_f>There are a couple of things I think I should remind you of...
r
Daisy_006_fcBefore the Forgetting, you had a place where you shared your amazing creativity and personal style.
Å
Daisy_008_frIt was called the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem>! A shop filled with stylish custom creations for everyone!
#
Daisy_009_fThat sounds amazing.
O
Daisy_010_f@It really was... I loved it, and I was determined to protect it.
Z
Daisy_011_fKSo when the Forgetting started, I went to see the Fairy Godmother for help.
|
Daisy_013_fmShe shrunk the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem> to make it pocket-sized, and I hid it here, in my House.
R
Daisy_001_fCAnd today's the day I finally get to give the Boutique back to you!
c
Daisy_018_fTDon't we need to make it big again? I can't just eat a cookie and make myself small.
*
Daisy_019_fOf course you can't, silly.
ñ
Daisy_020_fÜBut you can make the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem> bigger with a <ActivityItem>Wonderland Amplification Elixir</ActivityItem>.
(
Daisy_021_fWhat are the Ingredients?
»
Daisy_022_f∏The recipe mentions <ActivityItem>Dream Shards</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Carrots</ActivityItem>, <ActivityItem>Topaz</ActivityItem>, and <ActivityItem>White Daisies</ActivityItem>.
í
Daisy_023_fÇOnce you've crafted the <ActivityItem>Wonderland Amplification Elixir</ActivityItem>, you can apply it to your Royal Watering Can.
U
Daisy_024_fFThen you just have to water the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem>!

Player_001_choice_000_fSounds simple enough.
U
Player_001_choice_001_f:And it will grow back and appear in the Village by itself?
D
Player_001_choice_002_f)But won't it grow back INSIDE your House?
I
Daisy_026_f:When that's done, just take it and place it in the Valley.
t
Daisy_027_feNot by itself. You'll have to pick it up and place it on the ground. THEN the magic will take effect.
{
Daisy_028_flNope! The magic is much smarter than that. The Boutique will only grow back when you place it in the Valley.
Å
Daisy_000_frThe Old Ruler has been gone a long time, but I know they'd want the spirit of creativity to live on in the Valley.

Daisy_002_f*That's why I'm giving the Boutique to you!
`
Daisy_012_fQSo when the Forgetting started, I went to see someone who makes dreams come true!
K
Daisy_015_f<Dreams come true? I'm not sure I've met this Villager yet...
^
Daisy_016_fODon't worry √¢¬Ä¬î things are getting better every day. I'm sure you will soon!
•
Daisy_017_fïAnyway, she used her magic to shrink the <ActivityItem>Boutique</ActivityItem> and make it pocket-sized. I hid it here, in my House, for safekeeping!
